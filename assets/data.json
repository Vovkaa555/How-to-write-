		"explanation": "This is a symbol in search of a name. English speakers call @ the “at sign,” which will do while it serves as the universal symbol of an e-mail address. Its shape is also used along with other emoticons to represent expressions of the human face (see emoticons). But its resemblance to animals emerges through ad hostnames in other languages. In Danish, it’s seen as the“elephant’s trunk,” and in Chinese as the “little mouse.” Swedish as “cat’s foot,” and Dutch as “monkey’s tail.” The best consensus is for “snail,” which provides a name for @ in French, Italian, Hebrew, and Korean.♦ \n On quoting e-mail addresses, see under URL."

		"title": "a-",
		"explanation": "The a- prefixed to ordinary English adjectives and adverbs comes from two different sources. In a few cases such as afresh, akin and anew, it represents the Old English preposition of, and so anew was once “of new.” In many more cases it was the Old English preposition on, as in: aback, ablaze, abroad, afloat, afoot, aglow, ahead, ajar, alive, around ashore, aside, asleep, and astray. \n Thus ashore was literally “on shore.” \n In each set the two elements of the prepositional phrase have long since merged into one. But the past still shows through in the fact that as adjectives they are used only after the noun they qualify, either postpositively as in the way ahead or predicatively, i.e. as the complement of a verb, as in Route 66 is ahead. (See further under adjectives, section 1.) The adverbial functions of these words are also evident in collocations such as taken aback, go astray and get ahold of (see further at ahold). Others such as around are now both adverbs and prepositions. \n Note the apparently similar apart, which consists of French elements (a part ` ) rather than English ones. Its parity with aside is examined at aside (from)."

		"title": "a-/an-",
		"explanation": "These are two forms of a negative prefix derived from Greek. \n In English, its meaning is usually privative, i.e. “without” or “lacking.” It appears as the first component in some academic and technical words, such as: achromatic, analgesic, apathy, apathetic, anarchy, anarchic, aphasia, aphasic, anhydrous, atheism, atheist, and anorexia. \n As the two lists show, the form an- occurs before vowels and h, and a- before all other consonants. In most cases, the prefix combines with Greek stems which do not exist independently in English. In just a few, such as amoral, asexual, atypical, the a- combines with a Latin stem that is also an ordinary English word. In the case of amoral, the prefix makes the vital difference between amoral (“lacking in moral values”) and immoral (“contrary to moral values,” where im- is negative). \n ♦ For more about negative prefixes, see de-, in-/im-,non- and un-.

		"title": "a or an",
		"explanation":"Which should it be? \n a hotel or an hotel \n heroic effort or a heroic effort \n a RAF training course or an RAF training course \n a $8 ticket or an $8 ticket \n A single rule resolves all such queries: a is used before words beginning with a consonant, and an before those beginning with a vowel. This is straightforwardly applied in a doctor, a receptionist and an astronaut, an engineer. But note that the rule depends on the sound, not the spelling. We write a union, a unique gift, and a once-in-a-lifetime experience because the words following the article actually begin with a consonant sound (the “y” sound in the first two cases, and the “w” sound in the third). The same principle makes it an hour, an honor, and an honest man. The word following the indefinite article begins with a vowel sound. \n When writing abbreviations, the choice between a or an again depends on the pronunciation of the first letter. So a US Marine and a Unesco project are quite regular, as are an MP and an HB pencil. Any abbreviation beginning with F, L, H, M, N, R, S, or X takes an, because of the way those letters are pronounced. The effect is exploited in advertising for a brand of beer, where the use of A (rather than AN)shows how to pronounce the ambiguous brand name: \n I CAN FEEL A XXXX COMING ON AUSTRALIANS WOULDN’T GIVE A XXXX FOR ANYTHING ELSE \n Preceded by A, the brand name must be read as “fourex” not as “exexexex.” It nudges readers away from the unprintable or socially unacceptable interpretation of the word, while no doubt capitalizing on it. \n Similar principles hold for writing sums of money. Pronounce them and they select a for a £12 shirt and an for an $80m. loan, taking the cue from the number(which is said first) rather than the currency symbol(which is written first). \n Despite all that, certain words beginning with h are made exceptions by some writers and speakers. They would preface hotel and heroic with an rather than a, despite pronouncing the h at the start of those words. Other polysyllabic words beginning with h will be given the same treatment, especially if their first syllable is unstressed. In both American and British English, the words historic, historical, and historian are the most frequent of these exceptional cases, but the tendency goes further in Britain, by the evidence of matching databases (LOB and Brown corpora). They show that British writers use an to preface adjectives such as habitual, hereditary, heroic, horrific, hypothetical, hysterical (and their adverbs)as well as the noun hotel. There are far few examples in the American data, and the only distinctive case is herb, which is commonly pronounced without h in the US (though not in the UK or elsewhere). The King James Bible (1611) records the use of an with other monosyllabic words, as in an host and a house, though they are supposed to go with h-less pronunciations, formerly much more common. \n Over the centuries h has been an uncertain quantity at the beginning of words in many European languages. Most words beginning with h lost it as they passed from Latin into French and Italian. The Latin word hora meaning “hour” became French heure (pronounced “err,” with no h sound) and also the Italian ora, without an h even in the spelling. English retains an h in the spelling of hour but not in the pronunciation. The process also shows up in the contrasting pronunciations of heir (an early Englishloan from French) and hereditary (a Renaissanceborrowing direct from Latin), which embody the same Latin stem. Spelling pronunciation has revived the hin in some French loanwords like heritage and historian(those well used in English writing); while others such as hour, heir, hono(u)r are h-less, in keeping with the French pronunciation. Classical loanwords (apart from honorary, honorarium, and honorific) have settled on pronunciations with the h sounded; and they complement the many basic Anglo-Saxon words such as here, how, him, and hair, home, honey in which h is pronounced. (See further under h.) \n Nowadays the silent h persists in only a handful of french loanwords (heir, honest, hono(u)r, hour and their derivatives), and these need to be preceded by an. The h of other loans like heroic, historical, and hypothesis may have been silent or varied in earlier times, leaving uncertainty as to whether an was required or not. But their pronunciation is no longer variable and provides no phonetic justification for an. Its use with them is a stylistic nicety, lending historical nuances to discourse in which tradition dies hard. \n ♦ For the grammar of a and an, see articles. \n ♦ For the presence/absence of a/an in (1) journalistic introduction, see journalism and journalese; andin (2) t2) titles of books, periodicals, plays, etc., see under the."

		"title": "-a",
		"explanation":"This suffix is really several suffixes. They come into English with loanwords from other languages, including Italian, Spanish, Latin and Greek, and may represent either singular or plural. In gondola (Italian), siesta (Spanish), formula (Latin) and dogma (Greek), the -a is a singular ending, whereas in bacteria (Latin) and criteria (Greek), it represents the plural. \n Loanwords ending in singular -a are not to be taken for granted because their plurals may or may not go according to a foreign pattern, as discussed in the first section below. Loanwords which come with a plural -a ending pose other grammatical questions, to be dealt with in the second section. \n 1 Words with the singular -a mostly make their plurals in the usual English way, by adding an s. This is true for all the Italian and Spanish words, and many of the Latin ones. So gondola becomes gondolas, siesta becomes siestas, and aroma becomes aromas. The numerous Latin names for plants, for example mimosa, ponderosa, protea, sequoia, all take English plurals. However, Latin loanwords which are strongly associated with an academic field usually have Latin plurals as well, thus formulae along with formulas, retinae and retinas etc. So plurals with -ae prevail in writing intended for scientists and scholars everywhere, though the forms ending in -as are also available and used in nonspecialized writing and conversation. \n The major dictionaries differ over which words can take English plurals. Webster’s Third (1986) indicates an English plural for all the words listed below – either explicitly, as first or second alternative, or by the lack of reference to the plural (this being the dictionary convention for regular inflections). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) allows either Latin or English plurals for those set in italics below, but Latin only plurals for those set in roman. Note also that while the Oxford presents the Latin plurals as ligatures, Webster’s sets them as digraphs (see further under ae/e). \n abscissa, am(o)eba, antenna, aorta, aura, caesura, cicada, cornea, echidna, fibula, formula, hydra, lacuna, lamina, larva, mora, nebula, nova, patella, penumbra, persona, piscina, placenta, pupa, retina, stoa, tibia, trachea, ulna, urethra, vagina, vertebra. \n An English plural is natural enough for those latinisms which are both common words and technical terms (e.g. aura, cicada, cornea, retina). For some (e.g. aorta, urethra), the occasions on which a plural might be needed are not very many, and, when it is, an ad hoc English plural is all the more likely. Note that for antenna, patella and persona, the two plurals are used in different fields (see under those headings). For the plural of alumna, see alumni. \n Greek loanwords with singular -a can also have two plural forms. They bring with them their Greek plural suffix -ta, though they soon acquire English plurals with s as well. The Greek -ta plurals survive in scholarly, religious, or scientific writing, while in other contexts the English s plurals are dominant. Compare the traumas of everyday life with the traumata which are the concerns of medicine and psychology. Other loanwords which use both English and Greek plurals are: dogma, lemma, magma, schema, and stigma. \n For both dogma and stigma, the Greek plural is strongly associated with Catholic orthodoxy (see stigma). The Greek plural of miasma (miasmata) seems to have lapsed in C21 English (see miasma). \n 2 Words with plural -a from Latin are often collective in meaning, for example bacteria, data and media. There’s no need to pluralize them, nor do we often need their singular forms, though they do exist: bacterium, datum etc. (For more information, see -um.) The grammatical status of words like media (whether to construe them as singular or plural) is still unsettled. Those who know Latin are inclined to insist on plural agreement, on the grounds that data and media (not to mention candelabra) “are plural.” Yet the argument depends on Latin rather than English grammar; and is undermined by other cases such as agenda and stamina, which are also Latin plurals but now always used with singular verbs in English. The issues of singular/plural agreement are further discussed under collective nouns and agreement section 1; and at individual entries for candelabra, data, and media. \n ♦ For Greek loanwords with a plural -a, such as automata, criteria, ganglia, phenomena, see -on."

		"explanation":"This elliptical phrase, borrowed from Latin, means roughly “by way of something stronger.” Far from being an oblique reference to fetching the whisky, it’s used in formal discussion to mean “with yet stronger reason” and to introduce a second point that the speaker or writer feels will clinch the argument.

		"title": "à la",
		"explanation":"In contemporary English, this versatile French tag is deployed on many of the frontiers of taste, apart from haute cuisine. It is still exploited on a la carte ` menus that offer you taste-tempting dishes a la duchesse ` or a` l’indienne; and in countercuisine, it can be found in fast foods a la McDonalds ` . But beyond the restaurant business, a la ` can refer to a distinctive style in almost any domain, and the reference point is usually ad hoc, as in makeup [used] to amuse, a la Mick Jagger, ` or an oversight committee a la ` New York in the 1970s. As in those examples, the construction often turns on the proper names of persons or places, titles and institutions. It creates reference points in film – a la ` “Casablanca” – and fiction – a la “Portnoy’s ` Complaint” – not to mention health management: whether to quarantine people with AIDS a la TB ` . Increasingly a la ` is found with common nouns as well, as in law a la modem, ` and seats covered with vinyl a la taxicab, ` among the examples from CCAE. \n A la is a clipped form of the French a la mode (de), ` which explains the feminine form of the article (la). In English it works as a fixed phrase, rather like a compound preposition, and there’s no suggestion of adapting its grammatical gender from a la ` to au when the following name is masculine (see the Mick Jagger example above). \n The grave accent is still often printed on a la ` in English, especially British English, though it is by no means a recent borrowing (first recorded in 1589). No doubt its use is often prompted by a taste for the exotic; and the accent – and the fact that the phrase still tends to be italicized – help to emphasize its foreignness. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) updates the entry on a la ` without registering the accentless form, whereas it appears as an alternative in Webster’s Third (1986)."

		"title": "à la carte",
		"explanation":"This is one of the many French expressions borrowed into English to cover gastronomic needs. Literally, it means “according to the card.” At restaurants it gives you the freedom to choose from individually priced dishes – and the obligation to pay whatever the bill amounts to. The a la carte ` system contrasts with what has traditionally been known as table d’hote ˆ , literally “the host’s table.” This implies partaking of whatever menu the restaurant has decided on, for a set price. The phrase goes back to earlier centuries, when the only public dining place for travelers was at the host’s/landlord’s table. But table d’hote ˆ is what most of us partake of when traveling as tourist-class passengers on aircraft. In restaurants more transparent phrases are used to show when the menu and its price are predetermined: fixed price menu (in the UK and US), or prix fixe (in France and francophone Canada). In Italy it’s menu turistico. \n Though dictionaries such as New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) continue to list a la carte ` and table d’hote ˆ with their French accents, they are commonly seen without them in the English-speaking world."

		"title": "abbreviations",
		"explanation":"These are the standardized short forms of names or titles, and of certain common words and phrases. The term covers (i) abbreviated words such as cont. and no., i.e. ones which are cut short or contracted in the middle; and (ii) abbreviated phrases such as AIDS, RSI, formed out of the first letters of words in a phrase. Both groups can be further divided (see under contractions section 1 for abbreviations v. contractions; and under acronyms for the distinction between acronyms and initialisms). The punctuation given to each group varies according to American and British styles, and within them, as discussed below in section 2. However, there’s a consensus that most types of the symbol should be left unpunctuated (see section 1 below). \n Abbreviations of all kinds are now accepted in many kinds of functional and informative writing, as neat and clear representations of the full name or title. Certain abbreviations such as EFT or FTP are better known than their full forms (electronic funds transfer, file transfer protocol ). The idea that they are unacceptable in formal writing seems to derive from writing in the humanities, where they are less often needed. Abbreviations may indeed look strange in the text of a novel or short story. Yet who can imagine a letter which does not carry abbreviations somewhere in referring to people and places? Business and technical reports could hardly do without them. \n Provided they are not obscure to the reader, abbreviations communicate more with fewer letters. Writers have only to ensure that the abbreviations they use are too well known to need any introduction, or that they are introduced and explained on their first appearance. Once the reader knows that in a particular document, CBC equals the Children’s Book Council or the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or the Carpet Bowls Club, as the case may be, the short form can be used from then on. \n Provided they are not obscure to the reader, abbreviations communicate more with fewer letters.

Certain special categories of symbols never appear with a stop/period, anywhere in the world. They include: \n symbols for SI units: kg, ml, etc. (See SI units.) \n  compass points: N, NE, SW, etc. \n  chemical symbols: Mn, Ni, etc. \n  symbols for currencies: GB£, A$, etc. (See Appendix ix.) \n One other group of abbreviations which never take stops are acronyms like a laser, and scuba (i.e. those which are pronounced like words and written in lower case: see acronyms). \n  2 Abbreviations that may or may not be punctuated, according to regional editorial practice (all other groups of abbreviations, of titles, institutions, placename elements, and ordinary words and phrases). The various practices and their applications are illustrated below, followed by a discussion of each: a) using stops with any kind of abbreviation (= traditional American style) \n G.A.T.T. U.K. Mr. Rev. mgr. incl. a.s.a.p. b) using stops with abbreviations but not contractions (= traditional British style) \n G.A.T.T. U.K. Mr. Rev. mgr incl. a.s.a.p. c) using stops for short forms with any lower case letters in them i) \n  GATT UK Mr. Rev. mgr. incl. a.s.a.p. (all abbreviations) ii) \n GATT UK Mr. Rev. mgr incl. a.s.a.p. (excluding contractions) d) using stops for short forms consisting entirely of lower case letters: \n GATT UK Mr. Rev mgr. incl. a.s.a.p. *Option (a) is the easiest to implement, and has been the traditional practice in the US, though the Chicago Manual (1993) noted its erosion amid the worldwide trend to use less punctuation. Familiar abbreviations can be left unstopped because the reader needs no reminder that they are shortened words or phrases. *Option (b) turns on the distinction between abbreviations and contractions and gives punctuation to the first group but not the second. In theory, a contraction like mgr (“manager”) is not a “true” abbreviation, but a telescoped word with its first and last letters intact. Compare incl. which is clearly a clipped form of “including,” and in which the stop marks where it has been abbreviated. This distinction developed in C20 British style (see contractions, section 1) but has never been fully standardized (Ritter 2002), and is varied in particular fields (e.g. law) and by publishing houses. It never was part of the American style. Canadian editors note the distinction, though they call contractions “suspensions,” in keeping with French editorial practice. However, the consistency of the traditional American style is appreciated when the two types of abbreviations are juxtaposed (Editing Canadian English, 2000). In New Zealand and Australia, the government Style Manuals (1997, 2002) have maintained the distinction, though the majority of Australian editors, writers, and English teachers surveyed through Style Council in the 1990s (Peters, 1993c) begged to differ. \n  A particular conundrum for those who observe the distinction is what to do with pluralized abbreviations. Should the plural of vol. be vols, vols. or vol.s? Because the plural abbreviation preserves the final letter, there’s an argument for treating it as a contraction and abandoning the stop, although it seems odd to have different punctuation for the singular and plural: vol. and vols respectively. The stopped alternatives are themselves anomalous. In vol.s the plural inflection is separated by a stop from the word it should be bound to; and in vols. the stop no longer marks the point at which the word has been clipped. Vols. is in fact the British choice (Butcher’s Copy-editing, 1992, and Ritter, 2002) as well as the American, generally speaking. However, the Chicago Manual (1993) embeds the curiosity that Protestant scholars use Pss. for Psalms, whereas it’s Pss for their Catholic counterparts in the New American Bible. \n *Option (c) According to this option, stops are dispensed with abbreviations that consist of full capitals, but retained for those with just an initial capital, or consisting entirely of the lowercase. This is in line with style trends in many parts of the English-speaking world. Capitalized acronyms and initialisms like OPEC, UNICEF, and BBC are normally left unstopped, as indeed they appear in the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors (1981), and are now explicitly endorsed in the Chicago Manual (2003). This was the preferred practice of freelance editors in Canada (Editing Canadian English, 1987), and those surveyed in Australia via Style Council in 1992. Stopless acronyms/initialisms are normal in the world of computing, witness ASCII, CD-ROM, etc. Standardized abbreviations for nation-states such as NZ, SA, and USA usually appear without stops these days. They do contrast, however, with other national abbreviations such as Can., Germ. and Mex., which are still to be punctuated, according to both British and American references. Within the US, the two-letter abbreviations used in revised zip codes are standardized without periods, whether they consist of one or two words. Compare NY and WY (New York / Wyoming); RI and WI (Rhode Island / Wisconsin). Despite this growing consensus on leaving stops out of capitalized acronyms and abbreviations, the distinction between abbreviations and contractions still divides British and American styles on lower-cased short forms. Hence suboption (ii) involving contractions, which is British-preferred; and (i) the more fully regularized suboption, which accords with American traditional practice. \n *Option (d) builds on the trend described in (c). It takes its cue from the presence/absence of an initial capital letter and applies stops only to those that begin with a lowercase letter. The option brings abbreviations such as Can into line with USA and does not attempt to distinguish between contractions and abbreviations in lowercase. This gives it more appeal in America than Britain because it would require stops to be put back in contractions such as mgr, which the British are accustomed to seeing in stopless form. For Americans, it goes the furthest in the direction of reducing the “fussiness” of word punctuation mentioned by the Chicago Manual (1993) – and is easily applied by printers and publishing technicians. \n A fifth option, to use no stops in any kind of abbreviation, is not commonly seen on the printed page but appears increasingly in digital style on the internet. It is easiest of all to implement and would resolve the anomalies created by distinguishing contractions from abbreviations (options b, c (ii)). It would also break down the invisible barrier between abbreviations and symbols (section 1 above). Leaving all abbreviations unstopped is sometimes said to be a recipe for confusion between lowercase abbreviations and ordinary words. Yet there are very few who could be mistaken. Those which are identical, such as am, fig, and no are normally accompanied by numbers: 10 am, fig 13, no 2, and there’s no doubt as to what they are. The idea of leaving abbreviations totally without stops may seem too radical for the moment, but it would streamline the anomalies and divergences outlined in this entry. \n International English selection: The third option (c (i)) for punctuating abbreviations – using periods/full stops for abbreviations containing one or more lower case letters – recommends itself as a reasonable compromise between American and British style. It is in keeping with the worldwide trend to reduce punctuation, without any commitment to different punctuation for contractions and abbreviations, and the anomalies that it creates. (That distinction is embedded in option c(ii), for those who wish to maintain it.) \n 3 Stopped abbreviations at the end of a sentence. When an abbreviation with a stop/period is the last word in a sentence, no further stop needs to be added: \n Remember to acknowledge all contributors – the producer, director, screenplay writer, cameramen etc. \n In such cases, the “stronger” punctuation mark (the period / full stop that marks the end-of-sentence) covers for the lesser stop marking the abbreviation. This is in keeping with the normal convention (see multiple punctuation). By the same token, it masks the editorial decision as to whether the abbreviation should be stopped or not – which readers sometimes need to know. When necessary, it’s best to remake the sentence so as to bring the abbreviation in from the end. This was done in discussing examples such as vol and vols in section (b) above. \n ♦ For the use of stops with the initials of a person’s name, see under names. \n  ♦ For the use of the stop/period in Latin abbreviations, see under that heading."

		"title": "abide and abode",
		"explanation":"At the turn of the millennium, neither of these is much used. The verb abide appeared quite often in the King James Bible, translating an array of Hebrew and Greek verbs meaning “dwell,” “stay,” “continue,” “remain” and “endure” – senses which linger in the Victorian hymn “Abide with me,” often sung at funeral services. Otherwise, it survives mostly in the phrase abide by (a decision), and in the slightly colloquial idiom can’t/cannot abide or couldn’t abide [something or someone]. \n The participle abiding serves as an adjective in combination with certain abstract ideals, for example, an abiding concern, his abiding faith in humanity; and in the compound law-abiding. Yet shrinking usage overall leaves people unsure about the past tense. Is it the regular abided or abode, which was used consistently in the King James Bible? The evidence of British and American dictionaries and corpora is that abided is preferred. As a noun, abode is mostly restricted to legal phrases such as no fixed abode and right of abode. Other uses, including the clich´e my humble abode, and freely formed expressions such as the abode of my forebears, have an archaic ring to them."

The Latin tag deo volente (“God willing”) is used in the same way in contemporary English."

		"title": "able and able to",
		"explanation":"The use of (be) able to as a semi-auxiliary verb dates from C15, though it is not equally used in the US and the UK. The British make more of it, in the ratio of 3:2 according to the evidence of comparable C20 databases (LOB and Brown). It reflects the greater British use of modals and modelized verb phrases generally (see modality and auxiliary verbs). \n In both varieties of English, able to take animate subjects much more often than inanimate ones, as in: \n  Thompson was able to smell a bargain a continent away. \n As in that example, able to normally combine with an active verb (see further under voice). This was the pattern in hundreds of corpus examples, the only counter-example with a passive verb being the chapel was still able to be used (from LOB). Able to seems to insist on being construed with animate, active participants, as if it still draws on the energy of the adjective able, expressed in an able politician and able-bodied citizens. Able appears much less often as an adjective than as an auxiliary verb in both British and American data: in the ratio of 1:11 in LOB and 1:12 in the Brown corpus. It occurs mostly in nonfiction genres of writing, perhaps because the approval expressed in it seems detached rather than engaged with the subject."

		"title": "-able/-ible",
		"explanation":"Which of these endings to use is a challenge even for the successful speller. They sound the same, and the choice between them often seems arbitrary. In fact, the choice is usually fixed by the word’s origins. Unabridged British and American dictionaries – Oxford (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986) – do allow that certain words may be spelled either way in contemporary English, although they diverge on which have the option, and only a handful of words are given alternative spellings in both:  \n collapsable/collapsible \n collectable/collectible \n  condensable/condensible \n ignitable/ignitible \n preventable/preventible \n Those apart, the following are independently credited with alternative spellings by Oxford and Webster’s, marked O and W accordingly: \n avertable/avertible (O) \n confusable/confusible (O) \n  connectable/connectible (O) \n contractable/contractible (O) \n deductable/deductible (O) \n detectable/detectible (O) \n  diffusable/diffusible (O) \n discernable/discernible (W) \n  expressable/expressible (W) \n extendable/extendible (W) \n  extractable/extractible (W) \n impressable/impressible (W) \n  perfectable/perfectible (W) \n suggestable/suggestible (O) \n  transfusable/transfusible (W) \n  Others such as digestable/digestible and resistable/resistible could probably be added to that list, but for the fact that Oxford presently marks their -able spellings as cutting out in C19. \n The -able suffix is the more widely used of the two in English at large, partly because it combines with any Anglo-Saxon or French verb (believable, enjoyable), as well as neo-Latin ones, as in retractable or contactable. Fresh formations based on neo-Latin can provide alternatives to the well-established loan from Latin, as with contractable/contractible, where the first (in the sense “able to be contracted”) is a modern word, whereas the second “able to contract” goes back to C16. Yet the opposite tendency is also to be found: Oxford Dictionary citations show that some start life with -able, as did deductable and detectable, and later acquired neo-Latin spellings with -ible. The forces of analogy compete with regular word forming principles among these words, and because they are readily coined on the spur of the moment, the dictionary records are necessarily incomplete. Any word of this type not yet listed in the dictionary can legitimately be spelled -able, if it’s based on a current English verb stem, simple or compound, e.g. gazumpable, upgradable. In fact the stem is often a useful clue for spelling established words. \n Compare dispensable (whose stem is the same as the verb dispense) with comprehensible, for which there is no English verb “comprehens-.” Most words with -ible embody Latin stems with no independent verb role in English. (This is also true of a very few -able words such as educable and navigable, derived from the Latin first conjugation, but with enough relatives in English such as education, navigation, to secure their spelling.) The -ible words often lack close relatives, and the rationale for the spelling is not obvious unless you know Latin conjugations. The table below lists the most important -ible words, though where there are both positive and negative forms (e.g credible as well as incredible), it gives just one of them. \n accessible adducible admissible \n audible combustible compatible \n contemptible credible deducible \n divisible edible eligible \n feasible flexible incomprehensible \n incontrovertible incorrigible incorruptible \n indefensible indelible indestructible \n infallible intelligible invincible \n irascible irrepressible irresistible \n legible negligible ostensible \n perceptible permissible persuasible \n plausible possible reducible \n reprehensible responsible submersible \n susceptible tangible terrible \n transmissible visible \n The stems of -ible words come straight from Latin paradigms and are not normally used as English verbs (access and flex are exceptions in so far as they now serve as verbs). Most -ible words express rather abstract senses, unlike those ending in -able, which typically build in the active sense of the verb: compare defensible and defendable. Note also that words ending in -ible take the negative prefix in- (as in indefensible), whereas those with -able and based on English verbs are usually negated with un- (e.g. undefendable).

		"explanation":"Though both terms are current, the Latin-derived abolition holds sway in British as well as American English. In the UK abolition is effectively the only term, in data from the BNC, whereas abolishment plays a minor part in the US, appearing in the ratio of about 1:17, in data from CCAE. We might expect more of abolishment, which is just as old (dating from C16) and has more direct connections with the verb abolish. Yet legal and institutional uses of abolition give it strong social and political connotations, in the discontinuance of slavery and the death penalty. The productivity of the word is also reflected in derivatives such as abolitionist."

		"title": "Aboriginal and Aborigine",
		"explanation":"Since around 1800 the term aboriginal has been used as a generic reference to native peoples encountered by colonialists in (for them) remoter parts of the world. The capitalized form Aboriginal still serves as a collective reference to indigenous groups within the population, especially in Australia, but also in Canada, where it complements the use of First People / First Nation. In the US the general term is Native American or American Indian, and Indian is used by the people themselves. The use of the term Amerindian for the North American Indian is mostly confined to linguistics and anthropology. In South Africa, the indigenous people are referred to as black South Africans. No collective name is needed in New Zealand for the Maori because they are ethnically homogeneous. \n In current English, the noun aborigine is particularly associated with Australia but always capitalized as Aborigine/Aborigines. Its status vis-`a-vis using Aboriginal as a noun has been much debated on diplomatic and linguistic grounds. Aborigine was believed by some to be more pejorative than Aboriginal (though this view is not shared by the people themselves). Others argued that Aborigine was an illegitimate backformation from Aborigines, though few would now call it a linguistic crime (see backformation). Neither argument carries weight in terms of common usage. Australian sources on the internet return almost three times as many instances of Aborigines as of Aboriginals (Google 2002). Successive Australian government Style Manuals have swung from one paradigm to another (Peters 1995), and the sixth edition (2002) proposes Aboriginal(s) for the noun (singular and plural) as well as the adjective. So Aborigine(s) is currently ruled out of official documents, though other publications such as newspapers, magazines, and monographs make free use of it. \n For indigenous people themselves, generic terms are unsatisfactory whenever a more specific name can be found. Those preferred for particular regions of Australia are listed in the government Style Manual (2002), and for the First Nations of Canada in Editing Canadian English (2000). The names of federally recognized Native American tribes are listed on the internet at www.healing-arts.org/tribes.htm. \n ♦ For the use of Black, see under that heading."

		"title": "about, about to, and not about to",
		"explanation":"The fluidity of its meaning makes it about a word to watch. But as adverb/preposition, and as a semi-auxiliary in be about to, its uses are more generally accepted and more international than is sometimes thought. \n About as preposition and/or adverb has several meanings which are widely used and current in both the US and the UK: \n 1) “close to”/“approximately” in time, as in “come (at) about ten o’clock.” The approximation is handy whether the writer is unsure of the time, or prefers not to put too fine a point on it (see vague words). Though often presented as the British counterpart to the American use of around, the construction is just as familiar in the US, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). See further at around. \n 2) “close by,” “in the vicinity” (but not visible): “George is about. Could you hold on?” The adverbial use is conversational in tone, though it also appears in everyday writing, as in seeing who is about. This is sometimes said to be strictly for the British because Americans prefer around. But the US preference is not so strong as to exclude about, by the evidence of the Brown corpus. \n 3) “concerning” or “concerned with,” as in the letter is about reconciliation (preposition); that’s what it’s about (adverb). The preposition has always been standard usage, and the adverb is freely used in a variety of everyday prose in British and American databases. The emphatic form that’s what X is all about is also alive and well, despite the view of Webster’s English Usage (1989) that it was on the decline. There are hundreds of examples in data from CCAE and the BNC. Most involve impersonal subjects, as in that’s what art/life / free enterprise is all about. But in American data, there are a few examples with a personal subject, as in that’s what this candidate is all about and we know what we are all about. \n The most important use of about is in the collocation be about to, used as a semi-auxiliary verb to express future events or intentions (see auxiliary verbs section 3). Its shades of meaning vary with the grammar of the subject (first, second or third person): compare I’m about to go home (said with intent) and The judge was about to pronounce the sentence (future event). But the negative counterpart is not about to seem to have developed its strong sense of determination, irrespective of person. Intention and resolve are both expressed in I’m not about to stop you and Fox was not about to risk waiting for her inside her room (these examples from the BNC, showing its use in British English). The idiom not about to seems to have originated in the American South and South Midland, and it was being used in nationwide publications by the 1960s, and even by two American presidents (Truman and Johnson). Its potential ambiguity attracted the attention of usage commentators including Bernstein, writing in The New York Times (1968/9), but there’s no hard evidence of confusion with ordinary uses of the semi-auxiliary. \n Not about to probably has some rhetorical value in its negative understatement.

		"title": "absolute",
		"explanation":"This uncompromising word has been put to various grammatical purposes, in reference to (1) adjectives, (2) pronouns, (3) verbs, (4) clauses. In essence, it means that the word concerned stands alone in the sentence, without the usual grammatical connections to the phrase, clause, or sentence being expressed. Some of the applications outlined below belong to traditional grammar, but collectively they show how freely the term has been applied. Overuse of the term absolute would explain why there are alternatives, also noted below. \n 1 Absolute adjectives. The term absolute is usually applied to parts of adjectives that by their grammar or meaning are not involved in the comparison. Many grammarians use it to refer to the uninflected form of any adjective, e.g. bright, as opposed to brighter, brightest. (See further under adjectives, section 2). An alternative older name for this part of the adjective paradigm is the “positive” form. \n  The phrase absolute adjective is applied by usage commentators, e.g. Webster’s English Usage (1989), to adjectives whose meaning doesn’t permit comparison. They are also called “uncomparable adjectives,” by Garner (1998) and others. Either way, the quality they refer to either is or is not, and there are no grades in between. They resist being modified by words such as rather and very, for the same reason. But the phrase absolute adjective, as applied to unique and others, suggests that they have only one meaning (see unique for its several meanings). The fact that a word may have both comparable and noncomparable senses seems to be overlooked. The lists of supposed absolute adjectives varies considerably from one authority to the next – itself a sign of the fuzziness of the category. Most include complete and unique, but there the similarities end. Among those sometimes included are: \n countless eternal fatal first \n  impossible infinite last paramount \n  perfect permanent previous simultaneous \n  supreme total ultimate universal \n  Many of these are commonly modified by words such as almost or nearly, which Fowler (1926) allowed even for unique. You can posit approximations to an absolute state, if not gradations of it. That apart, comprehensive dictionaries show that such adjectives have both nongradable and gradable senses. The gradable sense is clearly being used in “a more complete account of events than ever before.” So the notion of absoluteness needs to be attached to the sense, not the whole word. If the term absolute adjective has any value, it would be to refer to defining adjectives (see under adjectives): \n  auxiliary classic horizontal \n  ivory second-hand steel \n With their categorial meanings, they cannot be compared. Fowler also used absolute to refer to adjectives that serve as the head of a noun phrase: as in the underprivileged, the young. In these generic phrases, the adjective behaves like a noun, in that it can be pre- or post-modified: the very young, the young at heart (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985). They are otherwise relatively fixed, always prefaced by the, and construed in the plural. \n Absolute comparatives are expressions in which a comparative form of an adjective appears, but no real comparison is made. In fact, comparisons are often implicit: they were explicit in only 25% of the examples in the Survey of English Usage, according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). But there could be no comparison at all in conventional or institutionalized expressions such as: my better half, the finer things of life, Greater London, higher education, and the younger generation. We never imagine a starting point for them in “my good half,” “high education” etc., so they are absolute comparatives. This is not of course the case with the familiar advertising line: BRAND XXX WASHES WHITER – which invites consumers to conjure up the comparatively murky linen produced by an unnamed competitor while avoiding any claims for libel. Absolute superlatives embody the superlative form of an adjective without any specific comparison. Like absolute comparatives they are often conventional expressions, and often involve best as in: best practice, best seller, all the best, put your best foot forward. Others are a worst-case scenario, worst enemy; do one’s darndest; on/from the highest authority. Freely formed examples like the kindest person, and the loveliest day involve a kind of hyperbole (see under that heading). \n 2 Absolute pronouns. This is the term used by some grammarians (Huddleston, 1984) for possessive pronouns which stand as independent nouns, such as: hers, ours, yours, and theirs. The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) calls them independent pronouns. See further under possessive pronouns. \n 3 Absolute verbs are those not complemented by the usual object or adjunct, as in They ate. (See further under verb phrase section 3.) This use of absolute is also at least as old as Fowler (1926), and appears in some older dictionaries. \n 4 Absolute constructions or clauses are grammatically independent phrases or nonfinite clauses, not integrated with the sentence in which they appear. Some are so conventional as to pass unnoticed, e.g. that being so, all things considered. Others created ad hoc by the writer may be censured as dangling participles or unattached phrases: see further under dangling participles."

		"title": "abstract nouns",
		"explanation":"These words carry broad, generalized meanings that are not tied to the specific instance or a tangible, concrete item. The essential abstract noun is the name for an intangible such as honesty, justice, or knowledge, though modern grammarians recognize many other kinds of words which refer to abstractions or imputed entities such as energy, luck, and research. Many abstract nouns are constructs of the language itself, built up out of other, more specific words. Thus abstractions such as formality, graciousness, prevention, and severance are generated out of descriptive adjectives such as formal, and gracious, and action verbs such as prevent and sever. Even ordinary and familiar words can take on abstract meanings in analytical writing. Think of field and grain. We usually imagine them in concrete terms, but in expressions like the field of study and grain of truth, they become detached and abstract. Broad cover terms such as article, creature, and vehicle are also abstract until applied to a particular object. A vehicle may thus take shape as a car, tram, bus, truck, bicycle, or perhaps even a skateboard or wheelbarrow. (For more on the distinction between abstract and concrete nouns, see nouns.) \n Abstract nouns are a useful means of building ideas. They help writers to extend their arguments and develop theories. They can encapsulate remarkable insights, and summarize diffuse material under manageable headings. The downside is their too frequent appearance in academic and bureaucratic clich´es. In his classic Complete Plain Words (1962), Gowers talks of the “lure of the abstract [word]” for British civil servants, and of the need to “choos[e] the precise word.” Most American students are familiar with the injunction of their “freshman composition” textbooks to “prefer the concrete to the abstract,” although the prevalence of the opposite in professional writing has been noted by researchers such as Lanham (1974) and Couture (1986). Computer software can identify some of the abstract languages in a text, i.e. words ending in -tion, -ness, -ity, -ance, -ancy, -ence -ency, and other characteristic suffixes. It cannot identify ordinary words used in abstract senses, let alone decide whether they are appropriate for the subject. Abstract words are not necessarily reprehensible, but their cumulative effect on the weary reader needs to be factored in. \n ♦ For further discussion of related issues, see gobbledygook and nominal."

		"title": "academia, academe and academy",
		"explanation":"The first of these words is both the most ancient in form and the most popular now, at the start of C21. Academia (Akademeia) was the name of the Athenian garden associated with the legendary Greek hero Akademos (in medieval times called Academe). Plato’s school of philosophy took its name from the garden, hence later references to “Plato’s Academy.” \n The use of academe to mean “place of learning” is first recorded in Shakespeare’s Love’s Labour’s Lost, where it appears in the singular as well as plural (alongside “books”) as the source of “the true Promethean fire.” Fowler (1926) took Shakespeare to task for using academe in reference to an institution rather than a person and would have liked even less its extended use to refer to the whole academic community and environment. Merriam-Webster (2000) embraces all these senses, whereas only the institutional ones appear in New Oxford (1998), Canadian Oxford (1998), and the Australian Macquarie (1997). In American and British usage, academe most commonly appears in sets like arts, academe, and the professions. Otherwise, it provides the context for many a work of fiction – apart from Mary McCarthy’s novel The Groves of Academe (1952), and Mark Stein’s play (c. 1980) of the same name. The phrase groves of academe now have more than a whiff of clich´e about it, but at least it can be varied. Large databases such as the BNC and CCAE show a range of alternatives: halls of academe (hybridized with “halls of [higher] learning”), realms of academe, world of academe, ivory towers in academe, and even the ghetto of academe. \n Fowler’s criticism of using academe in the sense “academic world” could perhaps have prompted the rise of academia as an alternative term since World War II. In fact, academia outnumbers academe by 4:1 in both the BNC and CCAE, and it collocates in much the same way with “halls,” “ivory towers,” “cloisters,” and “groves” itself. Like academe, it appears in sets like “labor, business, and academia” to designate a sphere of activity and influence. No doubt its more transparent form (ending in the abstract suffix -ia) gives it an advantage over its competitor, which lacks formal analogues in English. (See further under -ia.) \n The phrase the academy is very occasionally found as a synonym for academia and academe, but its usage is mostly worlds apart and has been much broader than either, especially in C19 and earlier C20. In the UK, academy served as the common term for an alternative type of school to the classically oriented grammar school; and in North America, it was used in reference to private schools. It’s now more familiar as the key word in the names of various specialized institutes of the performing arts – the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Franz Liszt Academy of Music – as well as visual arts and sciences. In the US, the word academy is built into the names of defence force training centres such as the West Point Academy, not to mention the metropolitan Police Academy, immortalized through movies. The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences lends its name to the Academy Awards, and winners there enjoy professional esteem comparable to that of the Academy exhibitor among the British art establishment. These various institutions give a specialized meaning to the academy that distinguishes it from academe and academia, yet it now lacks generic usages enough to guarantee it a long future. \n ♦ For the Academie Franc¸aise ´ and other language academies, see language academy."

		"title": "accents and diacritics",
		"explanation":"In a speech, an accent is a general style of pronunciation which strikes the listener as different, as in a foreign accent, an Irish accent. It may involve the stress patterns of words as well as the way sounds are pronounced. The accents of written language mostly relate to individual sounds. When superimposed on a particular letter of the alphabet, accents show that the pronunciation differs in some way from the unmarked letters. The English spelling system does without accents, except for the occasional foreign word (see below). Many other languages make systematic use of accents to indicate aspects of sound, stress and pitch. The technical term for accent marks is diacritics. \n The most familiar accents are those of European languages, such as the French acute and the German umlaut which mark particular vowels, and the Spanish tilde and the Slavonic ha´ cek ˇ , used with particular consonants. Less well-known ones are the small circle used over u in Czech, and over a in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, and the slash used with l in Polish and with o in Danish and Norwegian. (See further at individual entries on acute, cedilla, circumflex, dieresis, grave, ha´ cek ˇ , tilde, umlaut.) Accents are also used to mark the strongly stressed syllables of some words in Italian, Spanish and Irish. Some Asian languages written in the Roman alphabet, such as Vietnamese, have accents to show the different tones or pitch that go with a particular word: rising, falling, level etc. The use of accents shows the limitations of the alphabet for writing the sounds of diverse modern languages. (See further under alphabets.) \n Foreign accents/diacritics in English Accents may be included in the English spelling of loanwords, depending on whether the word is a common noun or proper name, and the context of communication. \n a) Loanwords which become English common nouns tend to lose their accents in the course of time, witness French loans such as crepe, debut, elite, facade, and role. Their disappearance is helped by the fact that English typewriters and word processors rarely have accents in their repertoire, and neither does the internet. In fact, there’s no reason for accents to be retained in words such as role or elite, where the vowel letters themselves match the pronunciation. The accents would mostly be missed by francophones and those for whom it adds cachet or a hint of sophistication. In Webster’s Third (1986) the unaccented form of all those words is given priority, whereas the opposite holds true for the Oxford Dictionary (1989). This difference probably correlates with divergent regional trends, as well as the fact that the original Oxford (1884–1928) was much more inclined to mark loanwords as “not naturalized,” with accents shown to correlate with their perceived foreignness. Though the “foreign” symbol has been removed from many of these loanwords in the second edition (1989), the accents remain and accentless alternatives are not yet recognized. Copy-editing (1992) suggests that if accents are to be marked, all those belonging to the word should be there, e.g. proteg´ e,´ resum ´ e´. The more functional approach is to use whatever accents are essential to distinguish loanwords from their English homographs. Hence resume´ with one accent to contrast with resume. (See further under resume´.) Even so, the context may provide all that’s needed to identify them as nouns and verbs respectively, just as it does for expose´ and expose. Only the first could appear in an expose of corruption ´ and the second in the will to expose corruption. The difference between pique and pique´ is embedded in their particular collocations: a fit of pique v. a pique table cloth. When both are adjectives, readers may depend more on the accent to distinguish their attributive use, as in a flamboyant lame suit ´ and a lame duck. The accent is more crucial when the homographs work in the same grammatical slot. \n b) Well-known foreign names with accents/ diacritics generally lose them when reproduced in English. Thus Dvorak is usually written without the ha´ cek ˇ , Zurich without the umlaut, and Montreal without its acute. In some contexts of communication, however, retaining such accents assumes some strategic and diplomatic importance. This would be so for British or American authors writing for EU readerships; or for anglophone Canadians when writing French-Canadian names and titles into public documents, such as Sept-Iles ˆ and Musee de ´ Nouveau Brunswick. Note also that accents are used on capital letters in Canadian French, though not regularly in Metropolitan French. For further details, see Editing Canadian English (2000)."

		"title": "acceptance or acceptation",
		"explanation":"At the start of C21, these two are scarcely interchangeable as the noun counterpart to the verb accept. The latinate acceptation could once be used to mean “a state of being accepted or acceptable,” but the last trace of it was around 1800, by which time the French-style acceptance had replaced it for all practical purposes. Just one application remains for acceptation: to refer to the interpretation or understanding of a word which is the focus of academic or legal discussion. American data from CCAE provides a single example in which a court found that “by common acceptation, the description [white pine] has acquired a secondary meaning as firmly anchored as the first.” On that one showing, and the two British instances in BNC, acceptation is close to extinction."

They contained no examples of accessary apart from a very dubious British example, in which the word was flanked by three misspelled words. Dictionaries which continue to present accessary as an alternative spelling are presumably justifying it from specialized legal documents, which perpetuate archaic writing conventions. Meanwhile, the spelling accessory has always been preferred for the extra item(s) that go with any complex outfit, whether it is a set of clothes, a car or a computer."

		"explanation":"The second and shorter spelling is not as obsolete as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) claims.

These numbers suggest that accidently is somewhat commoner in American English, and its relative frequency vis-`a-vis accidentally confirms it: about 1:15 in American data, whereas it’s 1:28 in the British data. Accidently is sometimes regarded as a spelling mistake or malformation, but its pedigree is obscured by the fact that accident was once an adjective, from which it could be derived quite regularly. Common pronunciation of the word (with stress on the first syllable) also supports the shorter form. This is not to say we should prefer it to accidentally: rather that it cannot be dismissed as a solecism."

		"explanation":"Accommodation, and the related verb accommodate, may well qualify as the most widely misspelled words in otherwise standard writing of the late C20. Yet “accomodate” was not uncommon in earlier centuries, as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) shows. Celebrated authors such as Defoe, Cowper and Jane Austen used it. The insistence on two ms thus seems to have firmed up during the last 100 years. It is unquestionably in line with the etymology of the word (its root is the same as for commodity and commodious). But unless you know Latin, the reason for the two ms isn’t obvious. One pair of doubled consonants (the cs) seems enough for some writers as if a kind of dissimilation sets in. (See dissimilate or dissimulate.) \n  Accomodation is still relatively rare in edited prose, however commonly seen in signs and advertisements. British data from the BNC has accommodation outnumbering accomodation by almost 100:1, and in American data from CCAE the ratio is still close to 70:1. Neither Webster’s Third (1986) nor the Oxford Dictionary presents the single-m spellings as alternatives, though they allow consonant-reduced spellings of other words such as guer(r)illa and millen(n)ium, despite their etymology. The management of double and single consonants is a vexed issue for various groups of English words (see single for double). \n Until recently, American English was distinctive in using the plural accommodations in reference to temporary lodgings or arrangements for lodgings, whereas British English preferred the singular. But the BNC provides evidence of accommodations being used now in the UK as well – in advertisements for oceanfront accommodations, as well as more abstract discussions describing how each party is prepared to make substantial accommodations to the other. Overall there are 45 instances in the BNC, as opposed to thousands in CCAE, but enough to show that the plural form is being recommissioned in Britain. The Oxford Dictionary shows earlier British citations up to about 1800."

Compare: \n The judge addressed the jury / them (direct object) \n The judge gave the jury / them his advice (indirect object) \n Because the words jury/them are the same for both roles, the term objective case is often used in English to cover both accusative and dative. \n ♦ For more about grammatical case, see cases and object. \n ♦ For the so-called “unaccusative,” see ergative and middle voice."

		"explanation":"This Greek element, meaning either “top” or “end,” brings both kinds of meaning into English in loanwords. In words like acrophobia and acropolis (including the Acropolis in Athens) it means a “high position.” In others, like acronym and acrostic, it means the “tip” or “extremity” of the words involved. The acrobat is literally “one who walks on tiptoe.” "

		"title": "acronyms",
		"explanation":"An acronym is the word formed out of the initial letter or letters of a particular set of words. Thus an acronym, like an abbreviation, carries the meaning of a complex title or phrase: \n ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) \n NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) \n UNICEF (United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund) \n WHO (World Health Organization) \n Acronyms like these are written without stops, and may metamorphose further into words by shedding their capital letters, except for the first one. Thus NATO can also be written as Nato, and UNICEF as Unicef. When acronyms become common nouns, they are written entirely in lower case. For example: \n laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) \n radar (radio detection and ranging) \n scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) \n snag (sensitive new-age guy) \n Not all acronyms are nouns. The adjective posh is believed to have begun as an acronym, standing for “port outward, starboard home”– unquestionably the choicer side of the ship, if you were a colonial journeying between Britain and India, and wanted to avoid the tropical sun. Another is the adverb AWOL (still usually capitalized) which in military parlance is “absent without official leave,” but used much more widely in the phrase gone AWOL, to cover an unexplained absence. \n The desire to create acronyms which are both pronounceable and meaningful has exercised many an action group, such as: \n ASH (Action on Smoking and Health) \n CARS (Committee on Alcohol and Road Safety) \n LIFE (Lay Institute for Evangelism) \n MADD (Mothers against Drunk Driving) \n SWAP (Students Work Abroad Program) \n Strategically chosen acronyms can also provide a useful mnemonic, as in the SWOT analysis of business operations, under the headings of “strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats.” \n Acronyms and initialisms. All the acronyms discussed so far comprise strings of letters which combine to form syllables, and can be pronounced as ordinary words. This is not, however, possible with abbreviations like BBC or GNP, which have to be pronounced letter by letter. Technically they are initialisms rather than acronyms, although the term is not widely known. (The term alphabetism is still less common.) Yet initialism began as a nonce word just before 1900, according to the original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928). Though absent from the 1976 Supplement H–N, it eventually made a full entry in the second edition (1989). Still it remains a technical term for professional editors and lexicographers, and hardly leaves any trace in large general databases. There are no occurrences of it in CCAE, and only one (in the plural) in the BNC. Data from both corpora show that initialisms such as CBT (computer-based training) and FMFFV (full motion / full frame video) are simply called acronyms. The distinction is in any case flawed, because (1) an abbreviation can embody both types, as does MSDOS; and (2) the same abbreviation can be pronounced in two ways. Think for example of AKA (“also known as”) and UFO (“unidentified flying object”), which are two-syllabled acronyms for some speakers, and three-syllabled initialisms for others. Initialisms generally keep their capital letters, even when they correspond to strings of lower case words."

		"title": "active verbs",
		"explanation":"The term active is applied by grammarians to a verb whose action is performed by its grammatical subject. A classical illustration is a statement: I came, I saw, I conquered. \n Active verbs contrast with passive verbs, where the subject is acted upon by the verb’s action. There are three passive verbs in the historical punishment for high treason – He was hanged, drawn and quartered – although only the first one is fully expressed with a subject and a part of the verb be (see passive verbs). \n In written documents, active verbs are vital because they express action directly as an event, rather than making it a passive process. They are the natural way to keep a narrative moving vigorously along, and many books on good style recommend their use to ensure vigorous prose. Other things to avoid are discussed under gobbledygook, and impersonal style."

		"title": "acuity or acuteness",
		"explanation":"The adjective acute has for centuries had two abstract nouns: the latinate acuity being first recorded in 1543, and the home-grown English acuteness in 1646. Acuity is much more frequent than acuteness – by a factor of 4:1 in American English (CCAE) and 5:1 in British data from the BNC. Despite unequal shares of usage, they coexist through some specialization in their uses. The corpus data has acuity typically referring to the sharpness of vision, while acuteness is associated with the poignancy of feeling, suffering and the symptoms of the disease. Yet the BNC also shows some overlap, in that either may refer to the sharpness of intellect and observation, where the mind’s eye and the seeing eye coincide."

		"title": "acute accents",
		"explanation":" The meaning of this mark depends on the language being written. In some European languages, it marks a special vowel quality, as in French where it’s used for a tense e (one pronounced with the tongue higher than for other kinds of e). In Czech and Hungarian, the acute accent can be associated with any of the five vowels. Compare Polish, where it goes with the vowel o, and several consonants: c, n, s and z. \n Other languages deploy the acute accent to mark prosodic aspects of words. In Greek and Spanish writing, acute accents are placed over vowels to show that the syllables they occur in are stressed. Spanish homophones are sometimes distinguished this way: thus si (“if ”) and si (“yes”). In Vietnamese writing, the acute accent represents a rising pitch for the syllable concerned. \n Double acute accents are used in Hungarian on o and u, making different sounds from the same letters marked with umlauts. See further under umlaut."

		"title": "ad or advert",
		"explanation":"In the snappy world of advertising, abbreviated forms of the key word are indispensable, though they made their first showing in print some decades before the industry took off. The Oxford Dictionary’s record begins in Victorian England, with two citations from mid-C19, and one from 1902 whose author finds it “a loathly little word,” yet such was its popularity in the 1920s that admen themselves campaigned against it, fearing that it robbed their enterprise of dignity (Mencken’s Supplement to The American Language, 1945). With only two letters, ad is an abnormally brief word for embodying content (see further under words), and British dictionaries including the Oxford label it “colloquial.” American dictionaries such as Webster’s Third (1986) leave it unlabeled, and American corpus evidence confirms that it’s stylistically versatile, appearing in eight different categories of fiction and nonfiction in the Brown corpus, and in newspapers as well as monographs in the more recent CCAE. Reviewing its status, Webster’s English Usage (1989) concludes that it is acceptable to a large majority of Americans. It also occurs freely in contemporary British English, with over 750 instances (singular and plural) in the BNC, found in many kinds of publication, and connected with various British institutions including Sainsbury’s and Yorkshire TV. \n Other signs that ad is established are the increasing range of compounds based on it. Adman originated in the first decade of C20, but CCAE contains many others, usually spaced, such as ad agency, ad campaign, ad revenues and want-ads. Note that in all but the last example, ad means “advertising” rather than “advertisement,” though not all dictionaries recognize this. \n Advert also originated in C19 (first recorded in 1860), but did not gain popularity until the 1950s. Large databases confirm that it’s little used outside Britain. Though the BNC contains more than 800 examples (singular and plural) in BNC data, the tally from CCAE could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Its appearances in BNC texts – mostly the more interactive kinds of discourse – show that it’s still “colloquial,” as noted in the Oxford Dictionary. Advert as an abbreviation of “advertisement” keeps its distance from the identical latinate verb advert meaning “draw attention,” which appears less than 10 times in the BNC, and only in rather formal style.Both ad and advert are occasionally punctuated like abbreviations – ad., advert. – and there are examples among the Oxford Dictionary citations, though they are not proposed as secondary forms. For most writers ad and advert are established short forms, like exam or gym, and there’s no need to mark them as abbreviations of “advertisement” or “advertising.” See further under clipping. \n ♦ For the choice between advertisement and advertizement, see further under that heading."

		"title": "AD or A.D.",
		"explanation":"This abbreviation stands for the Latin anno domini, meaning “in the year of the Lord.” It represents a date calculated within the calendar devised centuries ago by the Christian church, which is still the standard for the western world. In the Christian calendar, all years are dated as being either before the presumed year of Christ’s birth (BC) or after it (AD). \n  According to a long-established principle of style, noted in Burchfield (1996) and the Chicago Manual (2003), AD should be written before the number in a date, as in AD 405, and BC after the number: 55 BC. Yet there’s increasing evidence that “it ain’t necessarily so.” Webster’s English Usage (1989) presents counter examples alongside conventional ones; and Webster’s Style Manual (1985) had earlier observed that, despite the convention, “many writers and editors place AD after the date” (as in 405 AD). It observed that this makes AD dates consistent with BC dates – and both then have the same order as when spoken. Database evidence from CCAE as well as the BNC confirms the trend in both the US and the UK, though it’s closer to being an equal alternative in the American data. The Cambridge International Dictionary (1995) allows both placements. \n The developing practice of placing AD after the year reference is supported by the now regular habit of having it follow the word century, as in the fifth century AD. This was the only location for it in many examples from the BNC and CCAE, and it’s accepted even by usage authorities who object to placing AD after the year. Once again it reflects the order in which the phrase is said, but it was once objected to on the grounds that the word anno (“year”) came awkwardly after “century.” Those who read AD in its original Latin terms are however increasingly rare. For most it simply means “in the Christian era,” and has a “purely conventional significance,” as the Chicago Manual (1993) put it. Most scholars and scholarly editors, it says, have “long since withdrawn their objections.” \n The punctuation and typesetting of AD raise a few further questions. The font is usually roman rather than italic, in keeping with the bold feature style of this entry, rather than the italics used in examples. With full typesetting resources it can appear in small capitals (see small caps), but in wordprocessed text and on the internet it typically appears in full caps. The use/non-use of stops in AD is a matter of regional and/or individual policy for capitalized abbreviations (see abbreviations). American authorities cited in this entry tend to use periods/stops (A.D.) and the British ones not. They are united in leaving no space between the letters of the abbreviation, but setting space between it and the year. \n ♦ For more about the writing of dates, see BC or BCE and dating systems."

		"title": "ad hoc, ad-hoc and adhoc",
		"explanation":"In Latin, this phrase meant “to this” and by extension “for this matter.” We use it in expressions like ad hoc committees, i.e. one set up for a specific and limited purpose, alongside the regular committee. In this precise context ad(-)hoc is neutral in meaning. In wider use it has come to mean “impromptu,” and, more negatively, “lacking in forethought or circumspection.” Decisions made ad hoc often seem arbitrary. These shifts in meaning, and the range of English derivatives (see below), show how thoroughly ad(-)hoc has been assimilated. \n Ad hoc is still usually set with space, whether used as an attributive adjective, as in ad hoc measures, or predicatively (or adverbially) as in Everything is very ad hoc (see adjectives section 1). In American data from CCAE, the spaced form (ad hoc) outnumbers ad-hoc by more than 7:1, in keeping with the general American practice of avoiding hyphens (see under that heading). The difference is even greater in BNC data (closer to 15:1), though this may have more to do with British preference for preserving the identity of the Latin phrase. The BNC also provides a score of examples of adhoc (set solid). This form has yet to be recognized in either New Oxford (1998) or Merriam-Webster (2000), but it’s the natural trend when the word is almost always an adjective rather than adverb, as the databases show. The fact that it has several derivatives is further evidence of its ongoing assimilation. The nouns derived from ad(-)hoc pose issues of spelling, illustrated in the alternative forms adhoc(k)ing, adhocism / ad hocism, adhoc(k)ery and even ad-hoc-ness, all registered in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). The Addenda of Webster’s Third (1986) adds adhocracy, a word which could be applied in many domains where adhoc(k)ery seems to rule. It conforms neatly to English spelling and doesn’t require any extra letter or hyphen to make it look like a real word. The Oxford variants ad hocism and ad hoc-ery show the persistent use of space to identify the Latin elements, though they highlight etymology at the expense of current meaning, and ignore the problems of suffixation (see further under -c/-ck- and -e). At any rate, a consensus has yet to be achieved on how to spell these words, leaving writers free to select or construct the form which communicates best."

		"title": "ad hominem",

		"title": "ad lib, ad-lib or adlib",
		"explanation":"In shortened form, this is the late Latin phrase ad libitum, meaning “at one’s pleasure,” or “as you please.” Musicians have known it for centuries as a directive to do as they like with the musical score: modify the tempo, add a few grace notes, and omit a few bars of repetition. Only in C20 was the word extended to other kinds of performance (particularly acting and public speaking), in which the speaker may extemporize beyond the script. Often it implies a complete absence of scripting. These more general uses of the phrase have turned it into a colloquial verb, as in having to ad-lib his way through a weather forecast. \n Both the New Oxford Dictionary (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) have the verb written as ad-lib, the last consonant of which is doubled when suffixes are added, as in ad-libbed, ad-libbing and ad-libber. The dictionaries propose the hyphened form ad-lib for the noun (an original ad-lib) and adjective (his ad-lib masterpiece) as well, though New Oxford uses ad lib when illustrating the rather rare adverb. Yet data from the BNC show a mix of ad-lib and ad lib for verb, noun and adjective in edited texts, and ad lib interchanging with adlib in broadcasting autocues (e.g. Harriet adlib), where its grammar is indeterminate. Data from CCAE have ad lib as often as ad-lib for noun, verb and adjective, in line with the greater reluctance of Americans to use a hyphen when spaced forms will do (see under hyphens). But ad(-)lib evidently varies in both the US and UK – which goes with the free-wheeling nature of the process it refers to."

		"title": "ad personam",
		"explanation":"This Latin phrase (literally “to the person”) has had two kinds of use in late C20 English: \n ∗ to describe appointments which are made to suit the individual candidate, rather than by general criteria \n ∗ as a nonsexist variant of ad hominem, on the mistaken assumptions that (a) the latter means “at the man” (male) rather than “at the human individual”; and (b) Latin persona can be used like “person” in English (see under -person and persona). Just what equal opportunity it provides for is unclear. \n Neither usage is widespread. The second, noted by Bliss (1966), seems to predate affirmative action of the 1980s, while the first makes its appearance in New Oxford (1998). There’s no sign of either in Merriam-Webster (2000)."

		"title": "adaptation or adaption",
		"explanation":"These are both abstract nouns based on the verb adapt. Adaptation is older by far with an antecedent in late Latin, whereas adaption appears first in C18, apparently formed on the analogy of adoption. Adaption has never been as popular as adaptation, to judge by the way it’s cross-referenced to the longest word in both Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989). In contemporary databases of British and American English, adaption is much less common than adaptation, in the ratio of about 1:20 in BNC and 1:40 in CCAE. What use it has in American English is typically in reference to a literary work being adapted for another medium such as television or film. But occasionally it refers to the adapting of computer software for different platforms, of industries to changing market forces, and of humans to extreme stress. The last is the sole example in CCAE to support the indication of the Random House Dictionary (1987) that adaption belongs to sociology. Clearly, the word is in wider use than its editors – or Fowler (1926) – were aware. Adaption is thus a viable alternative to adaptation and goes almost anywhere the verb adapt itself can go."

The chief difference is that adapter is much more frequent than adaptor in American English, occurring more than four times as often in CCAE; whereas in British English the situtation is reversed with adaptor occurring nearly four times as often as adapter in the BNC. In both databases, the words were used much more often in relation to mechanical, electrical or electronic devices than to people who adapt something such as a literary work. But the human sense was spelled as both adapter and adaptor, and there were instances of both co-adapter and co-adaptor in CCAE. "

		"title": "adherence or adhesion",
		"explanation":"These abstract words are both related to the verb adhere, meaning “stick to.” They differ in that adhesion usually refers to the physical glueing or bonding of one substance to another, while adherence means a less tangible connection, such as the commitment to a religion, philosophy, code of behaviour or international agreement. Yet there’s some crossover between them, which is acknowledged in American and British dictionaries, and evidenced in the corpora. \n The physical bonding expressed in adhesion can be chemical (as of household paint sticking to a surface), biochemical (as when bacteria attach themselves to cells) or mechanical (as of the grip of a tyre on the road or a shoe on the ground). In American English there is a further specialized legal use of the term in contract of adhesion (one which is attached to a job and cannot be negotiated by the employee). Among the crossover examples from CCAE, adhesion was also used in a few references to Christian affiliation (both conformist and nonconformist) and to political policy, in adhesion to free trade. These latter areas are the broad domain of adherence, which expresses many kinds of religious affiliation (Christian and non-Christian), as well as political and social commitments (to Keynesian economics, the Berne copyright convention and the new corporate mentality). Some applications were closer to home, as in adherence to a low-fat diet, or to a dress code of suits, ties and jackets for legislators. Again there were a few crossover examples in both CCAE and BNC where adherence (rather than adhesion) was used to express chemical and biochemical bonding. The interplay between the two words shows that they are not quite as specialized in their applications as is sometimes said, although adhesion remains the one to which more technical senses are attached. \n  Adherence still can be applied more freely, in many human and social situations. This helps to explain why it is much more common than adhesion, although the margin is greater in the US than the UK, judging by their relative frequency in data from CCAE and the BNC."

		"title": "adieu",
		"explanation":"In several European languages, speakers seem to invoke the divinity when taking leave of each other. Adieu (French) and adios (Spanish) both mean literally “to God”; and the English goodbye, originally “God be with you,” spells it out a little more. Goodbye is now totally secularized, an all-purpose farewell, whereas adieu retains a certain divine melancholy, a sense of the significance of the parting that it marks. Contemporary English uses of adieu illustrated in the BNC are mostly to be found in literary fiction, in direct address (“Gentlemen, adieu”), and in narrative comment, usually collocated with the verb bid in the sense “declare” (see further at bid). When used in nonfictional contexts, bidding adieu attaches historic moment to historical departures, as when “bidding adieu to Soviet troops” is coupled with “working out new treaties of good neighbourliness with the Soviet Union.” \n Adieu appears only very rarely in the plural, leaving some doubt as to whether it should then be the English adieus or French adieux. The major dictionaries endorse the first rather than the second: Webster’s Third (1986) does so explicitly, and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) implicitly, by the absence of plural specification. However the -x plural is still available for those who wish to emphasize the foreign origins of adieu, and it‘s needed of course in titles such as Les Adieux, given to one of Beethoven’s sonatas."

		"title": "adjacent, adjoining and adjunct",
		"explanation":"The first two words imply closeness in space, and both may indicate objects or areas juxtaposed to each other: \n The company suffered a serious setback when fire gutted much of the adjacent warehouse.  \n The area ranges from full sun beyond the herb bed to deep shade adjoining the house. \n Adjoining normally implies contiguity, though the common boundary often has to be deduced from context and may be no more than a right-angle connection, as in an alley adjoining the main road, and houses in adjoining streets. The sense of contiguity in adjoining probably stems from its visible connections with the word join; whereas the etymology of adjacent (“lying near”) is obscure to most. Adjacent doesn’t require things to be hard up against each other, though they may be, as in adjacent angles or the adjacent organs of anatomical descriptions. More often, adjacent seems to be used when the relative closeness of two objects is not so important, or not known. Consider its use in BNC examples such as research with grant-maintained and other adjacent schools, which leaves it open as to how many schools in a given district are covered by the study. \n Adjacent is also used to refer to the position of an item immediately preceding or following in a sequence (Webster’s Third, 1986), and the relationship begins to be a matter of time rather than space. Add this to its already wider range of applications, and it’s no surprise to find that adjacent occurs more than twice as often as adjoining in both American and British English, from the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. \n Adjunct is a good deal more abstract than either adjacent or adjoining, and quite rare as an adjective. Its uses are official, as in adjunct professor, meaning one appointed by special (non-tenured) attachment to an institution. \n ♦ For grammatical uses of the noun adjunct, see adjuncts."

	{
		"title": "adjectives",
		"explanation":"Often thought of as “descriptive words,” adjectives just as often serve to define or to evaluate something: \n a big room a windowless room an awful room \n The same adjective may describe and evaluate something, as in a poky room. Writers can of course use more than one adjective in the same string, to create a multifaceted image. Wine labels and wine commentaries are a rich source of them: \n intense cool-climate fruit and smoky oak aromas very lively, fine, dry palate with a flinty edge and a long finish \n a medium-bodied cabernet-style wine, matured in small French casks \n Both simple and compound adjectives can go before the key noun, but the more elaborately phrased descriptors (“matured in...” etc.) need to go after it (in postposition). Theoretically there’s no limit to the number of adjectives you can pile up in front of a noun – only the risk of losing the reader with too many. As those wine descriptions show, a set of three or four is plenty, especially if some of them are compound adjectives (on which see section 3 below). \n Adjectives appear in a conventional order, the evaluative ones coming first, before the descriptive ones, which always precede the definitive ones. This explains the sequences in smoky oak aromas and small French casks. Note also that the adjective modified by very comes first in the string, as in very lively, fine, dry palate. The same holds for any gradable or comparable adjectives (see section 2 below). Last and next to the noun are the definitive or categorial adjectives, such as French, which are nongradable. A further point to note is that definitive adjectives are often nouns conscripted for adjectival service, like oak in smoky oak aromas. (On punctuating sets of adjectives, see comma, section 3.) \n 1 Attributive and predicative adjectives. When adjectives precede the nouns they qualify, as in the examples above, they are said to be attributive. But many also occur independently after a verb, particularly if they are evaluative or descriptive. Compare for example small casks with The casks were small. In cases like the latter, adjectives are said to be predicative, because they form part of the predicate of the clause, complementing the verb and its subject (see further under predicate). Attributive and predicative uses yield different meanings in some cases: compare an ill omen with She was ill. \n Some adjectives resist being used in predicative roles. Those such as utter, mere (and others when used as emphasizers e.g. a firm friend, the real hero, sheer arrogance) can only occur as attributive adjectives. The same is true of many which serve to define or categorize a noun (like meeting in the example meeting room), which could not be used predicatively in the same sense, if at all. Other adjectives are restricted to the predicative role, including those on the adjective/adverb boundary, such as: \n aboard abroad aground ajar awry \n We never say “the ajar door,” only The door was ajar. Whether ajar counts as an adjective or an adverb in that exemplary sentence is a conundrum, to be tested by syntactic criteria like those of the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). (See further under a- and copular verbs.) \n 2 Comparison of adjectives. The adjective system allows us to compare one thing with another, and to grade them on the same adjectival quality. There are however two systems of comparison, involving (a) suffixes or (b) more and most. Their application depends largely on how many syllables the adjective consists of. \n *Adjectives of one syllable are usually compared by means of the suffixes -er and -est, as in: \n  fine wine (absolute) \n finer wine (comparative) \n the finest wine (superlative) \n The different forms of the adjective – absolute (or positive), the comparative and the superlative – make the regular degrees of comparison for most everyday English adjectives. Good and bad are the major exceptions with their irregular paradigms good, better, best and bad, worse, worst. Other exceptions are adjectives like crushed and worn, which have verb (past participle) suffixes embedded in them, and whose degrees of comparison are formed periphrastically, i.e. with the help of more/most. Idiom occasionally dictates an irregular form for a one-syllabled adjective, as in the phrase “a more just society.” *Adjectives consisting of three or more syllables almost always form their degrees of comparison periphrastically, i.e. by means of adjectival phrases formed with more and most: \n an expensive wine \n  a more expensive wine \n the most expensive wine \n Exceptions among three-syllabled adjectives are those formed with un-, such as unhappy and unhealthy, whose comparatives and superlatives are as they would be without the prefix: unhappier, unhealthiest. \n *Adjectives with two syllables are less predictable in their forms of comparison than those shorter or longer. Many can be compared either way, such as: \n gentle gentler / more gentle /  gentlest / most gentle \n lovely / lovelier / more lovely / loveliest / most lovely \n The inflected forms are neat for attributive use, whereas phrasal comparisons are of course bulkier and lend themselves to predicative use, especially for emphasis. Other factors such as the need to use matching forms of comparison for paired adjectives, as in the most simple and straightforward solution, have been found to explain some of the variation (Leech and Culpeper, 1997). \n One large group of adjectives – those formed with -y – is more regular than the rest, using suffixes for the comparative/superlative suffixes almost always. The following are a token of the many: \n angry easy empty funny happy healthy heavy lofty merry noisy pretty speedy tidy wealthy weighty \n Ad hoc adjectives formed with -y are compared the same regular way: \n craggy craggier craggiest dishy dishier dishiest foxy foxier foxiest \n Compare adjectives ending in -ly, which are quite variable. Researchers have found that early always used suffixes for comparison, whereas likely was almost always compared with more/most. Others in the -ly group such as costly, deadly, friendly, lively, lonely, lovely can go either way. Some adjectives such as costly, deadly, friendly prefer the inflected form for the superlative, but use periphrasis for the comparative: more costly, costliest (Peters, 2000). Both patterns of comparison have been found with adjectives ending in -le (feeble, humble, noble, simple etc.), though they are more often inflected; and the same is true of those ending in -ow (mellow, narrow, shallow). Those ending in -er (bitter, eager, proper, sober etc.) tend the other way, making their comparisons with more/most. Adjectives with a derivational suffix, such as -ful (hopeful), -less (graceless), -ive (active), -ous ( famous) are always compared phrasally, as are those formed with -ed (excited ) or -ing (boring). But two-syllabled adjectives formed with the negative prefix un- (unfair, unfit, unwise) are compared by means of inflections, just like their positive counterparts. Beyond all those groups, there are individual adjectives which go their own sweet way: quiet is almost always inflected; common, cruel, handsome, minute, polite, remote appear in both inflected and phrasal comparisons. Regional studies of the two types of comparison show that American English is slightly more inclined than British to use phrasal comparison with -ly adjectives (Lindquist, 1998). Some have thought that writers would be more inclined to use phrasal comparison than speakers, though research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) showed the opposite: that the frequency of inflected adjectives was higher in all forms of writing (fiction, journalism, academic) than in conversation. Despite these tendencies, writers have some freedom of choice when comparing many everyday two-syllabled adjectives, to be exercised in the service of style, rhythm and rhetoric. The only caveat is to avoid using inflections as well as periphrasis in quick succession, as in “the most unkindest cut of all” (Julius Caesar, iii:2). Double superlatives like this were acceptable in Tudor English, but not nowadays. \n *Uncomparable adjectives. Many kinds of adjective don’t support any degrees of comparison – the quality they refer to cannot be graded. A definitive adjective like French (in French cask) either is or is not true. (More French than the French turns it ad hoc into a gradable adjective.) Other adjectives which cannot be compared are those which refer to an absolute state, such as first, double, last and dead. Uncomparable adjectives like those are sometimes referred to as absolute adjectives (see absolute section 1). 3 Compound adjectives consist of two or more parts, and may or may not include an adjective. They are the staple of journalese, as in the war-torn Middle East or power-hungry executives, but are also used creatively by advertisers, and by authors and poets for artistic purposes.

		"title": "administer or administrate",
		"explanation":"These come from French and Latin respectively, and as often the first has many more roles than the second. Dictionaries tend to cross-reference administrate to administer as if it could be freely substituted for it, yet administrate can scarcely take as its object things such as justice, punishment, medicine, poison, a blow, an oath or the sacrament, all of which collocate with administer. Administer has a distinctive intransitive use with to (once disputed, now dictionary-endorsed) which is found in examples such as administering to the sick, and this administrate cannot cover. The chief uses of administrate are close to the nouns administration and administrator, in the intransitive sense of “act as administrator” or transitively “manage the administration of ” (usually a corporate structure or institution). Neither is common in British English, judging by the dearth of examples in the BNC, but there’s a sprinkling of them in American data from CCAE. Intransitive and transitive uses are almost equally represented (the latter involving objects such as “department,” “estate,” “the act,” “private lands”). Administrate clearly has a role to play, one that is distinct from administer."

		"title": "admission or admittance",
		"explanation":"Though similar in age, these two abstract nouns for the verb admit having very unequal shares of the linguistic market. The latinate admission dominates the scene by about 40:1, according to BNC data. Admission scoops up the verb senses of confessing something or letting it slip, as in an admission of guilt or by his own admission, and admittance is only rarely found in such senses. Either word can be used when it’s a matter of entering or being allowed to enter (a controlled public place such as a stadium or exhibition), although admission is much more common, and the one built into compounds such as admission price. Hospitals institutionalize it in their nomenclature, ADMISSIONS being the section where patients are admitted for care. While admission invites entry, admittance is associated with denying it, in the conventional sign NO ADMITTANCE. The sign addresses those not authorized to enter a given area because of potential dangers or privacy – not those who work there, who would not be denied access by it. In a more upfront way, admission can also be associated with exclusive kinds of entry, for example, membership of professional groups, as in admission to the board of solicitors, or admission to the Bar. These official uses of admission may nevertheless suggest that the word is to be avoided when the access route is less formal, hence BNC examples such as admittance to Paradise and admittance to the afterlife (no “admissions board” to control access there!). \n Unexpected uses of admittance may amount to no more than the fact that it seems closer to the verb admit than admission does, and comes naturally when thinking of the verbal process. The most distinctive application of admittance is as a technical term in electronics, where it complements conductance, impedance and resistance in the structure of electrical systems. "

		"title": "adopted or adoptive",
		"explanation":"Usage books often present these as reciprocal adjectives, the first representing the perspective of the adopter, the second that of the adoptee. So adopted is the word to expect from parents referring to the child they have taken in, and adoptive is the child’s word to describe the parents he or she has acquired in this way. This distinction is perhaps a reflex of the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) note that adopted is used “especially of the child.” Yet its definition of adoptive allows either perspective: “an adoptive son, father etc.” and does not make the two words complementary. Whatever its basis, the “traditional distinction appears to be crumbling” says Burchfield (1996); and the BNC presents both regular and divergent examples, the latter including “adopted parent,” and “adopted family,” as well as “adoptive children” and even an “adoptive pup” in a veterinary report. In fact the selection of adopted or adoptive is immaterial because the following noun (“child” or “parent”) indicates the perspective."

	{
		"title": "advance, advanced and advancement",
		"explanation":"Subtle changes have taken place in the grammar and spelling of advance since it first appeared in C13 English. Its original form avaunce reflects its French origins, but in Tudor times it was remodelled as advance, in accordance with Latin spelling conventions, although it has no exact Latin ancestor. Originally a verb, by 1680 it was also used as a noun, as in the enemy’s advance, and attributively, as in advance guard. \n The uses of advance as an adjective and noun contrast with their grammatical counterparts advanced and advancement. Advance as an adjective indicates priority in time and/or space, as in advance notice; whereas advanced implies being well down the track in terms of achievement or sophistication, as in an advanced student or advanced thinking. The two cannot substitute for each other. Compare the noun advance with advancement, where dictionaries suggest there’s some common ground in referring to progress in a particular field of endeavour. Yet advance can hardly replace the other word in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, not because it is an established title but because advancement is an abstract concept, whereas any advance is specific and down-to-earth. The advancement of civilization would connote the heightening of cultural mores, whereas the advance of civilization could be a comment on the use of mobile phones in the Himalayas. The more abstract properties of advancement make it a useful euphemism for getting ahead in one’s career or profession, where advance is no substitute. Yet there are many more applications of advance for which advancement is unsuitable, and the first outnumber the second by more than 9:1 in British English and 4:1 in American English, in comparable databases (LOB and Brown corpora)."

		"title": "adverbs",
		"explanation":"Adverbs are the most varied class of English words, with a variety of syntactic roles. Some modify verbs, as the name adverb suggests. But many have other roles in sentences which are beginning to be recognized by individual names. The terms used to identify them below are those of the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). \n 1 Types of adverb. Adverbs which detail the circumstances of the verb are these days often called adjuncts, to indicate that they connect with the core of the clause without being part of it. Other types of adverb are subjuncts, which typically modify other adverbs or adjectives; disjuncts, which modify whole clauses or sentences; and conjuncts, which forge a semantic link between a sentence and the one before it. \n *adjuncts add detail to whatever action the verb itself describes. They may specify the time or place of the action, the manner in which it took place, or its extent. \n (time) tonight tomorrow soon then \n (place) abroad downtown indoors upstairs \n (manner) well quickly energetically thoughtfully \n (extent) largely partly thoroughly totally \n *subjuncts moderate the force of various kinds of word. Many such as really, relatively, too, very, modify adjectives and other adverbs, as in very strong/strongly. Some such as almost, quite, rather can modify verbs as well. Subjuncts of both kinds have the effect of either softening or intensifying the words they modify, hence the two major groups: \n (downtoners) fairly rather somewhat \n (intensifiers) extremely most so \n Expletives like bloody are powerful intensifiers of other adjectives, as in: a bloody good book (see further under intensifiers). A special subgroup of restrictive subjuncts serve to spotlight others and to narrow the focus of the sentence. They include adverbs such as especially, even, only. \n *disjuncts affect the interpretation of the whole clause or sentence, either as judgements of the likelihood of something happening (maybe, possibly, probably, surely); or as expressions of attitude towards the event ( fortunately, mercifully, regrettably, worryingly). They stand outside the core grammar of the sentence, and can be moved around within it: \n Fortunately the letter got there in time. \n The letter fortunately got there in time. \n The letter got there in time fortunately. \n Disjuncts, like subjuncts, can be used for emphasis, and have a significant interpersonal role to play in a writing style: see under interpersonal. \n *conjuncts are adverbs which play a cohesive role between separate sentences, or clauses. They include words like also, however, therefore, and thus express logical relationships such as addition, contrast and causation. (See further under conjunctions.) \n The same adverb can of course be used in more than way. Thus mostly can be an adjunct or a subjunct, depending on whether it quantifies the extent of something, or simply serves to emphasize it. Too is an attitudinal subjunct in too hot and a conjunct in I’m coming too. Yet can be an adjunct of time as in not yet here, and a contrastive conjunct, as in small yet tasty apricots. More controversially, hopefully is these days a disjunct as well as an adjunct (see hopefully). \n Note also that not, the negative adverb, is treated separately from other adverbs in modern English grammars. This is because of its affinity with negative words of other kinds, such as determiners and pronouns (neither, no, none). Not has wide-ranging powers within sentences, to modify a word (verb, adjective or another adverb), a phrase, or a whole clause. (See further under not and negatives.) \n 2 Adverbial structure and form. From all the examples above, it’s clear that adverbs do not necessarily end in -ly. (See further under -ly and zero adverbs.) Many like soon and well consist of a single morpheme. There are also compound adverbs, for example downtown and indoors. (See further under compounds, and hyphens section 2b.) Many adverbs are phrases: \n straight away to the bottom in no way a little bit without a care in the world \n Adverbial ideas can be expressed through several kinds of clause. See clauses section 4c. \n 3 Comparison of adverbs. Like many adjectives, adverbs allow degrees of comparison. Those consisting of one syllable, e.g. fast, hard, soon, make their comparative and superlative forms with inflections in the same way as adjectives: sooner, soonest etc. Adverbs formed with -ly enlist the help of more and most, as in more energetically, most energetically \n 4 Position of adverbs in sentences. Many adverbs can appear at various points in a sentence, as noted above (section 1) for disjuncts. Adjuncts can also appear early, late or in the middle of a sentence: \n Yesterday trading hit an all-time low. \n Trading yesterday hit an all-time low. \n Trading hit an all-time low yesterday. \n Conjuncts are relatively mobile also. (Compare that last sentence with the one above the set of examples, and see further under also.) There are few restrictions on conjuncts such as however, despite notions to the contrary (see however). The position of adverbs can be used to alter the emphasis of a statement, and to control the focus. (See further under information focus.) \n A very small group of adverbs (hardly, never, scarcely) require inversion of the normal word order when used at the beginning of a sentence. See under inversion. "

		"title": "adverse or averse",
		"explanation":"These words express different kinds of negative orientation: adverse relates to external circumstances, while averse gets inside the individual: \n With such adverse judgements on his case, he was still averse to reconsidering the action. \n Adverse is commonly applied to legal or official conditions that are hostile, or to threatening natural forces, as in adverse weather conditions or an adverse reaction to a drug. Averse expresses strong disinclination, though the idiom not averse to is used lightly or ironically, as in not averse to a little whisky. While adverse is mostly used attributively, averse is almost always predicative (see adjectives section 1). Grammar thus tends to keep them apart – but not entirely. In both the UK and the US, there’s evidence of adverse being used predicatively, and when the subject is personal there may be some doubt about the writer’s intention. See for example: \n Courts have not been adverse to developing the common law. \n Purity campaigners were not adverse to drawing on science to validate morality. \n The use of not seems to neutralize the difference between the two words, although the first example is probably still within the legal pale. The second clearly shows the use of adverse where you might expect averse – except that it lacks the element of understatement which goes with not averse to (see under figures of speech). The ratio of not adverse to to not averse to is about 1:3 in American data from CCAE. This confirms the rapprochement of the two idioms noted by Webster’s Dictionary of Usage (1989), though it has yet to be registered by Merriam-Webster (2000). New Oxford (1998) notes this use of not adverse to as an error, and usage data from the BNC makes it less common in British English as a substitute for not averse to, appearing in the ratio of about 1:11. \n Despite some convergence between adverse and averse in common usage, they contrast sharply in botanical descriptions. Leaves adverse to the stem turn towards it, while those averse to it turn away. These are the literal senses of the two words in Latin, but lost to contemporary English."

		"title": "advertisement or advertizement",
		"explanation":"The first spelling advertisement is given preference in dictionaries everywhere, including North America. This is as it should be, because there’s no evidence of advertizement in data from either CCAE or the BNC. Perhaps its currency depends on signs and unedited texts which are not included in those databases. The fact that advertizement gets dictionary recognition everywhere is curious, based perhaps on the preferred American pronunciation which according to Webster’s Third (1986) stresses the third (rather than the second) syllable. It may also represent the assumption that the -ise spelling would naturally give way to -ize in the US (see further under -ize/-ise). But the two instances of the verb advertize in CCAE are totally eclipsed by over 1100 instances of advertise. \n International English selection: The dearth of evidence for the spelling advertizement (or even advertize) makes the -ise forms preferable anywhere in the world."

	{
		"title": "adviser or advisor",
		"explanation":"Both these spellings are in current use, though adviser is the dominant spelling in both the US and the UK. The ratio in American data from CCAE is 20:1 and in British data from the BNC it’s 6:1. Curiously, advisor is sometimes said to be “the American spelling.” The Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes the frequency of the -or spelling in the titles of persons who give advice “especially in the US,” and this quasi-official usage has no doubt helped to make people aware of it. Yet the Oxford lists advisor only as a variant of adviser, with no independent headword even for cross-referencing. The spelling adviser is consistent with the majority of agent words formed in English (see -er/-or), and it goes back to C17, according to Oxford citations, whereas advisor is first recorded just before 1900. Whether it is simply a respelling of adviser or a backformation from advisory is a matter of debate. But whatever its past, advisor is registered alongside adviser in major British, American, Canadian and Australian dictionaries."

	{
		"title": "ae/e",
		"explanation":"In words like anaemic and orthopaedic the ae spellings present the classical Latin digraph ae, which became a ligature (æ) or just e in medieval times. The ligature is still used in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), but the digraph appears in abridged and smaller versions, notably the 1993 edition of the Shorter Oxford and New Oxford (1998). Other British dictionaries such as those of Chambers, Collins and Longman, have always used the ae digraph, either because of Fowler’s (1926) support for it, or the lack of typographic options. But American dictionaries like Webster’s Third (1986) make use of simple e-spellings in most such words, e.g. anemic, hemorrhage, orthopedic, instead of the ligature or digraph. The e spellings are standard in American English, except for (a)esthetic and arch(a)eology, where they are in the minority (in data from CCAE the digraphic spellings prevailed by more than 5:1). Canadians too use e rather than ae spellings, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). \n In British English, there’s increasing variability in spelling the largish set of classical loanwords including ae/e: \n (a)eon (a)esthetic (a)etiology \n an(a)emia an(a)esthetic arch(a)eology \n arch(a)eopterix c(a)esura di(a)eresis \n encyclop(a)edia f(a)eces gyn(a)ecology \n h(a)ematite h(a)emoglobin h(a)emophilia \n  h(a)emorrhage h(a)emorrhoids leuk(a)emia \n medi(a)eval orthop(a)edic p(a)ediatric \n p(a)edophile pal(a)eography pal(a)eolithic \n prim(a)eval septic(a)emia tox(a)emia \n Some of the most familiar ae words appear quite commonly now with just e – even in the UK. Data from the BNC confirms it for words such as medi(a)eval and encyclop(a)edia, and to a lesser extent for pal(a)eolithic, leuk(a)emia and orthop(a)edic. They constitute a scale, from words where e spellings are in the majority or close to it, to those linked up with medical or other kinds of technical usage, where specialists tend to preserve the ae (Peters, 2001a). The 1998–2001 Langscape survey showed that at least 25% of British respondents would use e spellings in archeology, leukemia, paleolithic, septicemia. These words and others such as orthopedic, were endorsed by 29–50% of respondents from Australia, where ae spellings have prevailed in the past. More remarkable still was the higher endorsement by second-language users of English, in Europe as well as Asia. Their support for e spellings was almost without exception higher than the British; and a majority of Continental respondents (often 70% +) voted for e spellings, except for aesthetic and anaesthetic – where they stood at 48% and 50% respectively. \n Apart from usage data, there are linguistic arguments in favor of the e forms. The ae digraph is awkward as a vowel sequence with no roots in common English spelling. It makes the ligature bulk too large, and sits strangely alongside other vowels in words like diaeresis, palaeolithic and others with the pal(a)eo- prefix. In words like septic(a)emia, the use of ae runs counter to the more general spelling principle that c followed by an “a,” “o” or “u” carries a “k” sound. (See further under -ce/-ge.) \n The use of ae is sometimes defended on grounds of etymology: that it helps readers to recognize the meanings of the classical loanwords. But ae is not so etymological, when it’s a Latin transcription of the Greek diphthong ai. The Greek root paid- meaning “child” is the one at stake in encyclop(a)edia and orthop(a)edic, as well as p(a)ediatrics and p(a)edophilia. Millions of readers without Greek recognize these words as wholes, not through the syllable in which paid- is embedded. We no longer look for the ae in pedagogue, pedagogy and pederast; and p(a)edophile and p(a)edophilia may be expected to go the same way. In nonspecialist usage, p(a)ediatrician could also join the group, though it’s protected by doctors in some parts of the world (see pediatrician or paediatrician). The specialists’ tendency to preserve ae in those words goes hand in hand with their greater use of ae plurals (rather than -as ones) for Latin words ending in -a (see -a section 1). They therefore deal more frequently with words embodying the digraph, and its distribution is more significant for them. Yet specialists looking to a wider readership outside the UK, e.g. on the internet, might take note of the various terms in this entry where the a of the ae digraph is bracketed, as a reminder that in linguistic terms it is unnecessary. Much of the world works without the ae digraph. \n International English selection: Spellings with e rather than the ae digraph are to be preferred on linguistic grounds as well as their wider distribution, throughout North America and increasingly in Continental Europe, Australia and elsewhere. In the UK it would streamline the currently uneven situation, whereby some words are already being spelled with e, and others vacillating over going that way. \n Final notes on ae/e \n 1 For use of the ae in Latin plurals, see -a section 1 \n 2 The ae digraph still substitutes for the ligature in classical proper names such as Aeneas, Caesar, as well as Anglo-Saxon ones such as Aelfric and Caedmon. \n 3 The ae at the beginning of words like aerial and aerobic is never reduced to e. In words like those it is part of the combining element aer(o)- (“air”), where a and e are separate syllables. See aer(o)-. "

But because of their similarity, and the fact that effect appears about three times as often as affect, the spelling “effect” tends to be inadvertently given to the verb. What complicates the picture is that in a rather formal usage effect can itself be a verb meaning “bring about,” as in: \n To effect a change of policy, we must appoint a new director. \n And in psychology affect can be a noun meaning “the emotion a person attaches to a particular idea or set of them.” Yet these latter uses are relatively rare. The psychological use of affect makes no showing in parallel British and American corpora (LOB and Brown), and there is one instance of effect as a verb to every 10 to 15 as a noun.

A language that expresses popular prejudices about old age is to be avoided – unflattering terms such as old bag/codger/duck/ geezer, geriatric (or gerry), granny, oldster – although being colloquial, they’re not so likely to appear in official prose. Journalists and broadcasters are nevertheless very aware of negative stereotyping of the elderly in the media, and the need to curb ageist language – gratuituous references to a person’s age, and the implication that anyone over 65 is over the hill. Stereotyping of any kind makes communication less inclusive (see further under inclusive language). \n When age is a relevant issue, neutral terms such as senior, senior citizen and (collectively) the elderly are widely used (see under seniors and elder/eldest).

But the argument is about as sound as suggesting that the word rivals should only be used for people who share the same river since that‘s how the word originated. \n The Oxford Dictionary (1989) has citations for aggravate meaning “vex or annoy” from 1611 on. They are typically associated with everyday prose rather than lofty writing; and in later C19 writing John Stuart Mill found the usage in “almost all newspapers, and . . . many books.” Dickens and Thackeray are notable users of it in their novels. But the Oxford labels it “fam.” (i.e. “familiar”), and others including Mill and Fowler actively censured the usage, one calling it a “vulgarism of the nursery,” and the other “a feminine or childish colloquialism.” Their condemnation seems to have led other usage commentators to the same judgement, though there are ample examples of its use in general C20 writing. Burchfield (1996) presents British examples of this “later” sense for aggravate alongside the “older” one, and allows that they coexist. In American English the two also coexist, though Webster’s English Usage (1989) reports that the sense “annoy” is somewhat less common than “make worse” in its files. But the Webster’s data also notes that for aggravating and aggravation the meanings “annoying”/“annoyance” are more common than those corresponding to “make worse.” This suggests the narrow focus of objections to aggravate, which have made a fetish of it. \n The “later” meaning of aggravate is now centuries old and has its place in speech and writing that invoke human feelings. It can scarcely be rejected on grounds of possible misunderstanding, because only a human subject or object of the verb can be annoyed, while other subjects or objects are made worse. \n A new frontier for aggravation is its application to aggressive confrontation on urban streets, among football crowds and elsewhere: \n Faced with the alternatives of the dole, or the angry aggravation of the streets, motherhood brings a sense of belonging. \n You’re not married? Whaddya do for aggravation? \n  I live near here. Four muggings away. \n The two examples, from the BNC and CCAE respectively, confirm this aggressive use of aggravation in the US as well as the UK. The new sense is quite removed from the abstract or internal senses which have hitherto been debated. It does not seem to have raised objections – perhaps the potential forces have been exhausted on the old bone of contention. In the UK attention has turned to aggro, an abbreviation formed with the -o suffix, first recorded in 1969. The casualness of its clipped form (see further under -o) confirms its origins in informal style, and Oxford labels it “slang.” Yet most of the 81 examples in the BNC come from academic and journalistic prose, not transcribed speech, and it works in a variety of collocations and compounds, notably full of aggro, aggro leader and the putative Aggro Cup. These examples show it moving into attributive roles, and the basis on which it’s likely to become a fully fledged adjective. In British English it has quickly become the most effective term for an ugly social phenomenon, more direct than aggravation in the newest sense. It has still to catch on in American English, to judge by the paucity of natural examples in CCAE, and Webster’s Third (1986) labels it “British,” without any stylistic restriction."

		"explanation":"The second spelling aggresser is technically possible, given the existence of a verb aggress, which was recorded in C18 and C19 with the potential to form an English-style agent word with -er from it.

		"title": "aging or ageing",
		"explanation":"British and American English diverge in the choice between these two spellings. In the US aging serves as the standard spelling for the verb participle, according to Webster’s Third (1986), and is endorsed by usage for the noun and adjective as well. In data from CCAE, aging is overwhelmingly preferred to ageing. Both spellings are current in the UK, but there ageing is a good deal more common than aging, outnumbering it by more than 12:1 in data from the BNC. However the two spellings are used equally for noun and adjective in very similar or identical phrases, such as ag(e)ing of the population and premature ag(e)ing. Examples of verbal use are elusive, though the regular aging might be expected from the fact that the Oxford Dictionary (1989) gives no special form for use in the verb phrase. For the noun (verbal substantive) and (participial ) adjective, the Oxford gives equal status to the two spellings with only a comma between them, but ageing has priority in the sequence. The linguistic arguments for aging are clear. It conforms to the basic English spelling rule of dropping a final e from the stem before adding a suffix beginning with a vowel (see -e section 1). Aging is consistent with raging, staging and waging (war), among others. Those who prefer ageing would say that age needs to keep its e because two letters are insufficient to maintain its identity. The argument is somewhat undermined by the existence of words like axing and icing. Aging itself is not new, but has been in print for well over a century, according to the Oxford Dictionary. It seems high time to affirm the regular spelling for all applications of the word. \n International English selection: Aging is the spelling for communicating with a worldwide audience, because it is standard in the US, familiar enough in the UK, and underpinned by one of the fundamental rules of English spelling. \n ♦ On the choice between ageism and agism, see under that heading.

Passive constructions like the last have perhaps fostered the more challenging active ones noted by C20 usage writers, though the Oxford Dictionary has active examples from C16 and C17. In American idiom, agree is almost always followed by a particle, either on, to or with, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), and these constructions are also very familiar in the UK. But Webster’s Third (1986) notes that the transitive use of agree with a following noun complement (as opposed to a clause complement) is “chiefly British.”"

		"title": "agreement",
		"explanation":"In grammar this is a technical term for the way words or word classes are matched in terms of number (singular or plural ), gender (masculine, feminine and [sometimes] neuter) and person ( first, second or third). An alternative name for the concept is concord. The principles of agreement can be seen in the selection of congruent word forms in sentences such as: \n That flower has had its day. \n Those flowers have had their day. \n This conventional matching of nouns, demonstratives, personal pronouns / determiners and verbs, to mark them (wherever possible) as either singular or plural, as inanimate (= neuter) rather than animate, and as third person reference, is known as formal agreement. It contrasts with notional or semantic agreement, to be seen in: \n The general public are still making up their minds. \n In sentences like these, the formal agreement of subject and verb would put the verb and following pronoun in the singular because “public” is formally a singular noun, but it’s overruled in that example by the plural notion that “public” entails, hence the selection of the plural verb and determiner. Many controversies over agreement turn on the interplay between formal and notional agreement. British English is often said to be more accommodating of notional agreement than American English. While this seems to hold for the treatment of collective nouns (see below), there’s much more convergence on other frontiers of agreement. \n Most issues of agreement can be addressed within the context of the sentence, looking at the subject and whatever agrees with it. The following discussion is therefore structured in terms of several kinds of subject: \n 1 collective nouns (e.g. government, mob) \n  2 nouns whose reference form ends in s (e.g. economics, Woolworths) \n  3 indefinite pronouns (e.g. anyone, each) \n 4 compound subjects (e.g. John and I, neither John nor I, eggs and bacon) \n 5 complex subjects, including quantifiers (e.g. a book of answers, a total of 20 students) \n All these will be discussed in terms of formal and notional agreement, as well as proximity agreement, where applicable. Proximity agreement is agreement with the number of the nearest noun, and underscores either formal or notional agreement, as the case may be. It particularly affects the constructions presented in sections 3, 4 and 5. \n 1 Collective nouns referring to groups or bodies of people or animals, such as government and mob, can combine with either singular or plural verbs in spite of their singular form. A very few, such as cattle, people, police require the plural; and staff takes a plural verb most of the time, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. But the Grammar reports considerable variability on others: \n The family has decided to celebrate on Sunday. \n The family have decided to celebrate on Sunday. \n The choice of verb makes it either formal or notional agreement, and carries slightly different implications. The singular verb implies an official consensus of the group, whereas the plural makes the reader/listener more aware that individual members assented to the suggestion. The same subtlety can be expressed with any one of a number of nouns referring to organized or casual groups of people: \n audience assembly board choir \n  class clergy club committee \n company congregation council couple \n crew crowd delegation department \n executive faculty family government \n group jury mob office \n orchestra pair panel parliament \n public quartet team trio \n union \n Respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) affirmed the viability of both singular and plural verbs for examples such as clergy, orchestra, panel, though American respondents were always more committed to the singular than the British. A study of many such words in newspaper data (Levin, 1998b) likewise found that American journalists made less use of plural verbs than their British counterparts. Yet both groups were strongly disposed to use plural pronouns in agreement with collective nouns. Collective nouns for animals, such as flock, herd, pack, school, shoal, swarm, troupe enjoy some freedom in terms of notional agreement, like that accorded to the human groups. This applies also to biological terms such as bacteria, algae, flora (see under individual headings) and fauna. \n Notional agreement in the plural is possible for a variety of proper nouns which are formally singular. They include: \n *Commercial businesses, government institutions and special interest groups, where the plural verb implies corporate activity: \n Foxtel have sold off some of their assets. \n The Red Cross have expanded the Geneva office. \n The Ministry of Defence are on our side. \n This happens in British as well as American English, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), and the combination of singular verbs followed by plural pronouns is also in evidence. \n *Sports teams identified by the proper names of cities and countries are not uncommonly found with plural verbs (and pronouns) in British reportage (but not American): \n England are all out for 152. \n Argentina were beaten 4:2 in their match against Sweden. \n *Metonymic references to governments, such as Beijing, Baghdad, Washington, Westminster, may likewise generate notional agreement in news reporting and headlines. (See further under metonymy.) \n ♦ For the choice between singular and plural agreement with data and media, see those entries. \n ♦ For agreement with adjectives used to head noun phrases (e.g. the poor), see under absolute section 1. \n 2 Agreement for nouns ending in s. Certain kinds of noun end in s even though they refer to a single object, raising doubts as to whether a singular or plural verb is required with them. The following clusters of words show clear tendencies for (a) plural agreement and (b) singular agreement. \n a) Plural agreement is normal for many ordinary objects, for example: \n  The jeans look too large on me. \n Those scissors were not sharp enough. \n Other examples of the two major groups are: \n *clothes \n bathers bermudas bloomers braces \n briefs corduroys daks dungarees \n fatigues flannels jodhpurs knickers \n leathers longjohns overalls pants \n plus fours pyjamas shorts slacks \n suspenders tights trousers undies \n *tools and instruments \n bellows bifocals binoculars forceps \n glasses goggles nutcrackers pincers \n pliers scales secateurs shears \n  spectacles tongs tweezers \n Plural agreement is also usual with various abstract nouns or composites ending in s, such as: \n amends arrears congratulations \n contents credentials dregs \n  dues funds goods \n grounds headquarters lodgings \n looks means odds \n outskirts pains premises \n proceeds regards remains \n savings surroundings thanks \n valuables \n Yet some uses of these are exceptional, as when grounds or means refers to a single, specific item and a singular pronoun is quite possible: on that grounds, by this means (see further under ground and means). A singular verb is sometimes found with headquarters and other words which refer to a collective establishment or operation (barracks, cleaners, gasworks). For example: \n The printers is near the traffic lights on Bridge Street. \n b) Singular agreement is usual for various kinds of nouns which serve as standard nomenclature for: ∗ academic subjects, as in: \n Economics/linguistics/physics/statistics was not my forte. \n ∗ games and sports, as in \n Athletics/dominoes/gymnastics/quoits makes a great spectator sport. \n ∗ diseases, as in \n Measles/mumps is raging through the neighborhood. \n However when words in any of these groups are used to refer to particular objects or instances (and are no longer names) they take plural verbs: \n His economics sound like those of a shopkeeper. \n The dominoes were all in the box. \n Measles are breaking out all over her face. \n The names of businesses such as Lloyds, McDonalds, Oddbins, Woolworths may take either singular or plural agreement. \n Woolworths is showing a strong profit margin this year. \n Woolworths are offering a discount on rubber bands. \n The use of the singular verb carries a stronger sense of the corporate entity. Although nouns ending in s are usually assumed to be plural, the -s inflection has other roles in modern English. (See further under -s.) 3 Indefinite pronouns. Some of these take a singular verb on all occasions, while others are variable. Those ending in -body, -one, and -thing have singular verbs on all occasions: \n Any-/every-/no-/somebody has a stake in it. \n Any-/every-/no-/someone like that is entitled to it. \n Any-/every-/no-/something that looks odd should be discounted. \n The third sentence shows how the singular requirement carries over into any relative clause depending on the pronoun. Note also that in spite of the formal agreement with a singular verb, the pronoun/determiner following an indefinite pronoun may have notional agreement in the plural, as in: \n Everybody has to pay their taxes. \n The Longman Grammar (1999) notes that the use of plural determiners and pronouns after indefinites such as everybody/nobody is common in both speech and writing. It satisfies the need for gender-free expression (see further under they). The use of purely formal agreement, as in Everybody has to pay his taxes, is nowadays felt to be sexist and unfortunate (as if men are the only tax-payers). The exclusivity is avoided in Everybody has to pay his or her taxes, yet the phrasing seems cumbersome. \n Indefinite pronouns such as any, either, neither are more susceptible to a plural verb when they appear as the head of the phrase, as in: \n Any of the books he wrote is/are worth reading. \n Neither of their suggestions appeal(s) to us. \n In such cases the plural verb could be prompted by proximity agreement – i.e. the adjacent plural noun – or by notional agreement, because the phrase implies a set of items. The use of a singular verb in such examples (i.e. formal agreement) singles out one item from the set. That apart, the singular construction sounds more precise and stylistically more formal; but examples of the plural verb could be found in written data analyzed for the Longman Grammar. Note that there is no requirement for singular agreement after none (see further under nobody). \n 4 Compound subjects. In the simplest cases, a coordinated subject such as John and I or brother and sister takes a plural verb, which makes them joint operators of the action: \n John and I have managed the refurbishment. \n But when the coordinates are uneven in length, or when the second coordinate is a singular noun, a singular verb may seem appropriate. See for example: \n JK’s article and the negative reaction to it was on her mind. \n Bird songs and the sound of the waterfall makes it a magical place. \n In the second example, the effect of proximity agreement with the nearer coordinate is to disengage it from the coordination. Singular agreement with one rather than both coordinates can be triggered by the use of the more elaborate coordinators, e.g. as well as, along with, together with. It can also be found with items coordinated by some common convention, as in: \n His bread and butter was telemarketing. \n Bacon and eggs is on the menu. \n In such cases the coordinated items form a notional singular. Singular agreement with bed and breakfast was endorsed by a majority of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001), in both the US and the UK. \n Coordinates which are alternatives often have a singular verb in agreement, as in A cup of coffee or a brisk walk is called for. The singular is confirms that that this is disjunctive coordination, in which the selection of one coordinate excludes the other. The same relationship is to be found in subjects coordinated with neither/nor as in: \n Neither brother nor sister was present. \n But the less formal Neither brother or sister were there is equally possible, and justifiable as notional agreement with both coordinates. Two-thirds of American respondents to the Langscape survey endorsed it, and about half of the British. \n Further options arise when the coordinates present a mixture of grammatical persons, especially the first person singular: \n Neither she nor I is?/am?/are? inclined to go. \n The use of is (third person) sounds awkward after I (first person), and am too is less than ideal: though it accords perfectly with I and provides proximity agreement, it makes a disjunction with she. Notional agreement would suggest are, to bundle she and I up together as plural, first/third person, but it’s still less than an elegant solution. Such sentences probably need redesigning, for example: I am not inclined to go and neither is she. \n 5 Complex subjects. Many a noun phrase has a hierarchy of two (or more) nouns within it, as in a lot of questions or a book of answers. The following verb will agree with whichever noun is the head (see further under noun phrases). In a lot of questions, questions is the head, with a lot of its determiner, and so plural agreement is called for: A lot of questions need to be asked. In a book of answers, book is the head, postmodified by of answers, and so singular agreement is required: A book of answers comes with the task material. Those two patterns of agreement (both involving formal agreement) are the common ones for complex noun phrases, except that lengthy postmodification with plural nouns can trigger proximity agreement, in spite of a singular head. See for example: \n Amid the crisis, the status of foreign nationals and aid-workers are uncertain. \n This kind of notional agreement is normally edited out of the written medium, but not uncommon in speech. \n Noun phrases that act as quantifiers can take either singular or plural agreement. Compare: \n A total of 192 cars was banked up behind the accident. \n A total of 192 cars were banked up behind the accident. \n As elsewhere when there are agreement options, the singular verb seems to invoke the set, whereas the plural verb makes us aware of the individual items in it. Both plural and singular agreement were found with quantifiers such as a group/set of and a range/series of, in the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus. Plural agreement is more likely for more informal quantifiers like: \n a batch of a bunch of a handful of \n a heap of a mass of a pile of \n  a rash of a score of a spate of \n More than 70% of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) endorsed the plural with a spate of.  American usage and usage commentators mostly run with the plural for such expressions, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), and it’s accepted for the verb and following pronoun in British English (Burchfield, 1996). \n For half of and none of, the choice between singular and plural depends on whether the following noun is countable (see under half of the and nobody). Agreement issues affecting the phrases majority of, one in/out of and number of are discussed under their respective headings. \n  Note finally that noun phrases embodying a specific amount which is judged as sufficient, appropriate, right – or the reverse – typically take a singular verb. For example: \n Twenty dollars takes you to the city and back. \n Six weeks in the African desert isn’t my idea of fun. \n These again show notional agreement, projecting the amount expressed in terms of cost, time, space, volume etc. as a singular item. \n Summary: Grammatical agreement overall is more regular than the numerous variations of this large entry might suggest. Formal and notional agreement coincide more often than not. But when they diverge, the choice of singular or plural has a subtle effect on meaning (see Reid, 1991); and it allows writers to narrow or expand their focus. When notional agreement and proximity both combine against formal agreement, they prevail in many kinds of writing. On its own, proximity agreement is usually played down."

		"title": "ahold or a hold",
		"explanation":"This composite word originates in spoken  language, but is now quite well established in print, at least in American English. More than 100 examples in CCAE have it occurring freely in quoted speech, and in narrative and commentary on events, with a number of distinct applications. Its most physical meaning is found in police reports on the apprehending of suspected criminals: before the FBI got ahold of him, and more metaphysically in reference to contacting anyone, as in trying to get ahold of him for a month. It can mean personal or political control, as in: \n You gotta get ahold of yourself. \n If the ultra-conservative right wingers get ahold of the legislature as they did the Republican platform . . . \n It can mean “mental grasp,” as in: \n Our style of music is not very elitist. Everyone can get ahold of it \n The new people haven’t gotten ahold of what we’re trying to do. \n  As in all those examples, ahold most often collocates with parts of the verb get, but CCAE also has a sprinking of collocations with grab (especially for physical encounters) and take (for the less physical sense of thriving) as in Maybe this absentee thing will take ahold and get more people to vote. \n Ahold makes no showing at all in British data from the BNC, and is labeled “dialectal” by the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Yet the BNC has almost 40 instances of get/got a hold, and their uses overlap with those found in American English, as in get a hold of himself (= personal control) and once they get a hold . . . (of plants thriving). The British a hold makes it a regular noun phrase whereas the American ahold allows it to be an adverb collocating with verbs in rather the same way as around and aside. (See further under a-.) The two different settings correlate with the fact that ahold of is a relatively fixed idiom in American English, whereas in British a hold collocates variously with of, on and over, and is less clearly established in contemporary prose."

		"title": "aide or aid",
		"explanation":"The spelling aide comes from the French phrase aide-de-camp, meaning “assistant on the field [of battle].” It became part of English military usage, and was subsequently extended to the assistants of diplomatic representatives, and heads of government, as in the governor’s aide. In the UK those are still its dominant uses, judging by data from the BNC, with few examples of its extension to more ad hoc roles as in “election job for Maxwell aide” or that of the “personal aide and driver.” In the US the word is applied to assistants of all kinds in both powerful and lowly roles, associated with the political party machines (a Republican aide), the Church (RC priest made an aide to Auxiliary Bishop), academia (anthropologist’s aide) or the local health service (a home-health aide). It can refer to a hired bodyguard (a short-term security aide) or domestic worker (a temporary round-the-clock aide . . . to help at home with such basic chores as eating and cleaning). The term occurs thousands of times in CCAE, and is no doubt particularly useful in news reporting because of its flexibility in referring to spokespersons who wish to be anonymous, or whose exact role and title are not known. \n While the noun aide is extending itself as a reference to many kinds of assistant, the much older word aid maintains its ground as a noun meaning “assistance” and as the verb “to assist.” As an abstract noun, aid is often qualified in specific phrases like first aid, foreign aid, hearing aid, legal aid. There are examples of aide replacing aid in such collocations (development aide, federal aide) in both CCAE and the BNC, but not enough to count as anything other than typos. For the moment, aide remains a human rather than abstract noun."

The nouns meanwhile are a mix, some borrowed from French (those ending in -nce), and some direct from Latin (those ending in -tion). The different vowels in the second syllables of some of the -nce words (e.g. abstinence/sustenance) are the impact of French on the original Latin verb.

		"title": "ain’t",
		"explanation":"Few usage issues hit the headlines as ain’t did in the US in the 1960s, with discomforting consequences. In informal conversation it draws little attention to itself, and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) traces its use back to a citation of 1778. But it has long been the bugbear of American school teachers (Webster’s English Usage, 1989); and its listing in Webster’s Third (1961) created a furore, despite the explanatory note that ain’t was “used orally in most parts of the US by many cultivated speakers, especially in the phrase ain’t I.” The Chicago Tribune beat it up into a sensational headline: \n SAYING AIN’T AIN’T WRONG! \n Others hostile to the new Webster’s tried to use the entry on ain’t to discredit the dictionary, ignoring the distinction between spoken and written usage – as often in fundamentalist discussions of language. This very public controversy over ain’t probably increased the stigma attached to it in the US, and the Harper-Heritage usage panel (1969–75) registered its strongest veto against it. Yet ain’t is still a signal of “congruent” informality between American speakers, according to Webster’s English Usage. Data from CCAE confirm this, with ain’t appearing freely in utterances quoted in newspapers, and in proverbial sayings such as: \n Things ain’t what they used to be. \n You ain’t seen nothing yet. \n If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. \n This town ain’t big enough for both of us. \n It also gets into print in reference to songs such as “Ain’t misbehavin’,” “Ain’t she sweet?” and “It ain’t necessarily so,” among others. Writers who play on those sayings or song titles can do so with little risk of censure. Through all this, ain’t seems to be more significantly embedded in American English than in British. In the UK ain’t is also associated with casual and dialectal speech (New Oxford, 1998). The BNC’s numerous examples of ain’t (more than 3500) come from spoken as well as written texts. But its appearances in print are almost always embedded in quoted speech – or quasi-proverbial sayings such as: \n London may be the centre of England, but it ain’t for me. \n The grammar underlying ain’t is remarkably complex, when you consider that it serves as a contraction for any of the following: \n am not is not are not has not have not \n All except has not are illustrated in the examples quoted above. Standard English has contractions for most of them, i.e.: \n isn’t aren’t hasn’t haven’t  \n But there’s no similar contraction for am not. Amn’t is regarded as childish or dialectal; and I’m not (reducing the verb rather than the negative) works only for declarative sentences. For questions, the contraction commonly used in the UK is Aren’t I? It looks odd written down, because it’s the form of the verb used with plural pronouns (we, you, they). Fowler (1926) argued that for the first person singular, ain’t ought to be an acceptable substitute, though it seems to have gone unheeded. Aren’t I is now the standard form for the question in British English, according to the New Oxford. However for some of the American Harper-Heritage usage panel, it was “a genteelism much worse than ain’t I.” \n Historically speaking, both ain’t and aren’t are probably descended from an’t, recorded during the late C17 as the regular contraction. Sound changes of the C18 affected the pronunciation of the vowel “a” before nasal consonants, raising it in some dialects, and lowering and retracting it in others. While ain’t is a product of the first process, aren’t represents the second in terms of British (r-less) pronunciation) – though not general American. If only an’t was still available, it would avoid the grammatical discomfort and provide a nonstigmatized alternative to ain’t."

See for example: \n animal annual capital casual final \n funeral liberal official oval principal \n rival spiral total verbal \n Some of these, e.g. rival, total, are also used as verbs. The question then arises as to whether or not we should double the final l before adding verb endings to them: rival(l)ed, total(l)ing etc. The issues are discussed at -l-/-ll-."

		"title": "alarm, alarum and alarmed",
		"explanation":"In C21 English, alarum is an archaism which survives only in the accounts of antique clock mechanisms, and in the combination “alarums and excursions” written as stage directions from C17 drama. It has no role as an alternative to alarm in its various other uses as noun and verb. Alarm meanwhile is extending its reach, visible in the use of alarmed to mean “fitted with a security alarm” which has been on record since 1969. It looks exactly like the past participle of alarm meaning “arouse fear in,” hence the strangely ambiguous notice that says: \n THIS DOOR IS ALARMED  \n Can the “intelligent building” also have feelings?! In this context both alarm and the -ed suffix contribute to the ambiguity. See further under -ed."

		"title": "alfresco or al fresco",
		"explanation":"This Italian phrase meaning “in the fresh air” or “out of doors” was first recorded in English in 1753. The Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) marked it as a foreignism, but set it solid as both adverb and adjective, anticipating its full assimilation. Webster’s Third (1986) also has it set solid, and, in American data from CCAE, alfresco leads the way over al fresco by 3:2. British usage goes the other way, with al fresco outnumbering alfresco by 3:1 in BNC data. Neither database gives evidence of a clear distinction between adverb and adjective: compare eating alfresco / dine al fresco and an alfresco supper / the al fresco buffet. We may conclude that the Italian setting now has more value for British writers, whereas in American usage alfresco is becoming fully integrated. A citation from CCAE featuring the alfresco black-tie Medici awards dinner says it all."

		"title": "algae",
		"explanation":"The Latin word for “seaweed” has become the generic name for a much larger group of both salt- and freshwater plants. Although it carries a Latin plural inflection, its sense in C21 English is often collective, hence its ability to take either singular or plural agreement. (See agreement, section 1.) Both constructions are well represented in British and American databases, as in: \n The algae offers good cover for minnows. \n Algae are never absent from the tissues of the hydras. \n American data from CCAE shows algae in agreement with singular verbs or pronouns (it, this) more often than plural, in the ratio of about 3:2. Singular constructions are also well represented in BNC data, on a par with the plural. \n Technically algae has its singular in alga (see further under -a section 1). But alga is largely confined to scientific prose: it makes very little showing in the BNC and even less in CCAE."

		"title": "alias and aka",
		"explanation":"Both these originate in the context of law and policing, as ways of linking the alternative names or identities by which suspects are known, e.g. Gillelmus alias Gilmoure and Joe Smith aka “Baby Face” Smith. Alias (in Latin “otherwise”) was used this way in C16, whereas aka (an acronym for “also known as”) appears first in the US after World War II. Aka has more quickly broken free from its legal background. It has been used to flag variant names for people and things in American English since the 1970s, and in British English from around 1990. There are BNC citations from a variety of publications in fields such as computing and music technology. \n Both aka and alias have an expanding range of uses in reference to persons and objects at large. They streamline the reviewer’s task of identifying actors, their roles and disguises, as in: \n Dr Evil aka Lawrence Fullers. \n Fawlty Towers waiter Manuel alias actor Andrew Sachs. \n In examples like these, the convention of giving the personal name first is reversed – a freedom which is sometimes exercised within the same document. In CCAE data, an article on Don Novello aka Father Guido Sarducci captions the photo as Father Guido Sarducci aka Don Novello. The reversability of aka and alias allows writers and editors to foreground whichever of the two names is more salient in the immediate context. \n Both aka and alias provide alternative names for movies and other entertainment products: Dawn of the Dead (aka Zombies), W & W Ventures Inc., alias Tooth Fairy Documentation Center. Both are used to juxtapose the common and foreign names of objects, as in Basque pelota (aka jai alai) and the columbine (alias aquilegia). Occasionally the second slot is used for satirical or humorous comment, witness Lord Rees Mogg aka the Pornfinder General and Miki’s mum – alias the hand in the ’70s Denim aftershave advert. The examples show how far aka and alias have come from their origins. \n Apart from its role as a link word, alias has other uses as a noun. Its use to mean “assumed name” dates from C17, but in late C20 computerspeak, alias is an alternative address to which the software can transfer electronic data. In this technical sense it also serves as a verb. \n Note that aka is normally written in lower case without stops, as is typical of acronyms, though it’s often pronounced as an initialism (see under acronyms). The variant forms a.k.a. and AKA with full capitals made very little showing in either BNC or CCAE. Although they would prevent confusion with words borrowed into English such as aka (Japanese for “red”) and aka (a Maori word for a type of vine), the problem seems pretty remote. Such words only come together in very large English dictionaries."

	{
		"title": "alibi",
		"explanation":"Like alias, the word alibi continues to distance itself from its Latin origins. Originally a Latin adverb meaning “in another place,” it was similarly used in Tudor court records: He was alibi. By mid-C18 its role as a noun was established, and this now dominates, by the evidence of both American and British databases. Just occasionally it serves as a verb, transitive or intransitive: \n . . . had reluctantly agreed to alibi her Both refused to alibi for their performance. \n The second example shows how alibi as noun or verb is now also used to mean “(an) excuse,” a usage which still carries the label “informal” in New Oxford (1998), though it has been around for more than 80 years. Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes that British censure of using alibi to mean “excuse” intensified following Partridge (1942), whereas the early objections of American commentators seem to have dwindled. Webster’s Third (1986) registers the meaning as standard, without stylistic warnings. In data from CCAE it’s used freely in news reporting on sports or political events, as in preparing your alibi in case you lose – as well as reviews of movies, where, for example, a mother and daughter joust, argue and alibi about their relationship with X. It would not be the first Latin loanword to acquire a new meaning in English."

		"title": "all and all of",
		"explanation":"The uses of all as pronoun and determiner are common and uncontroversial. Its ability to be either shows up in alternatives such as: \n All of the responses from Canada are positive (pronoun) \n All the responses from Canada are positive (determiner) \n In the second example, all is in fact a predeterminer (see under determiners). Data from the BNC show that all the is far more common than all of the, and lends itself to lengthy postmodification, as in: all the people involved in Stone’s $40 million movie ... Compare He can’t please all of the people all the time, where the all of phrase is not elaborated. \n All serves as an adverbial intensifier in idioms such as all the better (with a following comparative), and not all that good (always following a negative). The second type of construction is on the margins of written usage, but its acceptability in spoken usage was confirmed by Mittins et al. (1970) in the UK, and the Harper-Heritage usage panel (1969–1975) in the US."

In British English the opposite is true, and all-round dominates the data from the BNC. The very few instances of all-around were confined to advertising, as in an all-around shoe grip.

		"explanation":"An allegory is a narrative which uses fictional characters and events to portray salient aspects of real life, as does Orwell’s Animal Farm (1945) or Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings (1954–5). Dramas and movies can achieve the same: \n A simple tale of a teenager who hijacks a school bus to take him to his girl in another town, it is also a complex allegory of Love versus the Law . . . \n Taken separately, the people and events become symbols of things larger than themselves, and collectively they create allegorical meaning. Allegory was much favored in earlier historical times, partly because it offered artists an oblique way of presenting contentious political and social matters, without running the risk of imprisonment or worse. Allegories often carry a strong moral or message, whether it is homiletic (as in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress 1678) or satirical (as in the work of Byron)."

		"title": "almost",
		"explanation":"The adverbial uses of this word, as in almost died and almost undone, need no comment. More intriguing are its uses in noun phrases, some of which are standard and others on the fringe. Its use as a qualifier in almost everything, almost nothing is recognized in grammars and dictionaries, but they diverge on how to explain its grammatical role in expressions such as an almost saint and a victory almost, examples from the Oxford Dictionary (1989). In expressions like these it comes close to being an adjective, and the Dictionary explains this special role as “qualifying a substantive (noun) with an implied attribute.” Webster’s Third (1986) simply classes it as “adjective.” The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) meanwhile interprets this use as “metalinguistic,” and comparable to that of other “comment adverbs” (i.e. disjuncts: see adverbs section 1). However we choose to legitimize the coupling of almost with nouns, its use in both the US and the UK is shrinking. The latest American example in Webster’s English Usage (1989) is from 1972. A lone example in the LOB corpus – the almost certainty that they will lose money – suggests its obsolescence in British English."

		"explanation":"In both British and American English, this word has multiple roles as adverb and preposition, expressing both spatial relations (along the path, plodding along) and more abstract connections (experiments along those lines, expected to go along with the policy). But Americans make much more use of along to express accompaniment, as in: \n . . . the Indians whom the Spaniards had brought along with them. \n This use of along with is not unknown in British English (on a par with the other uses mentioned, in data from the LOB corpus). In the American Brown corpus, uses of along for “accompaniment” outnumbered all others by more than 2:1 (Peters, 1998b)."

		"title": "alongside and alongside of",

Dictionaries register alongside as both adverb and preposition, and the prepositional role (alongside the path) is much more frequent than the first (Rogers was alongside), judging by database evidence. Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes that the transitional form alongside of seems to be tailing off, and it makes only small showing in the databases, with about a score of examples in CCAE and the BNC. For example: \n The automobile is ranged alongside of the oxcart. \n We steamed alongside of the pier. \n Both along and alongside of are mostly used of physical proximity, but occasionally in more abstract ways: \n Alongside this ideal – perhaps provoked by it – ran strong counter-currents. \n . . . a continuity of leadership alongside of infusion of new leaders."

Citations obtained by Webster’s English Usage (1989) are mostly from memos, private correspondence and draft prose. The occasional instance of alot might be just a typo, a failure to press the space bar on the keyboard. But its recurrence in typescript or in handwritten manuscripts makes it more significant, as the shadow of things to come. Alot lacks real analogues: the nearest is awhile, also compounded with the indefinite article, but sanctioned by centuries of use. Other adverbs beginning with a involve a reduced form of “on” or “of.” See a-."

	{
		"title": "alphabetical order",
		"explanation":"Alphabetical systems are not all alike. Differences emerge if you look closely at the order of items in a library catalogue, a computer-ordered list and several dictionaries. The two major alternatives within alphabetical systems are letter-by-letter order, and word-by-word order. The differences show up in the sample lists below. \n Letter by letter: \n bitter, bitterbark, bittercress, bitter end, bitter-pea, bitter pill, bitters. \n Word by word: \n bitter, bitter end, bitter pill, bitterbark, bittercress, bitter-pea, bitters. \n In the letter-by-letter order, all word spaces and hyphens are disregarded. The order often has unrelated words juxtaposed in the list. Its advantage is that you can easily find compounds with variable spacing, because their location depends purely on the letters. With the word-by-word system, you work only as far as the first word space, and this brings spaced compounds in immediately after their base word, and compounds which are hyphenated or set solid follow after. It pulls related words together in the list, whatever their settings, and works well with words or names whose settings are invariable. \n Dictionaries use modifications of the two systems, depending on how far they “unpack” compounds and derivatives associated with the base words into separate entries. Webster’s Third (1986) goes furthest in the letter-by-letter direction, and unpacks not only compounds but also derivatives such as bitterly and bitterness to take their alphabetical place. Merriam-Webster (2000) and New Oxford (1998) unpack the compounds but keep bitterly/bitterness as run-ons/run-ins within the main entry for bitter (see run in or run on). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) goes further in the word-by-word system, grouping many sets of compounds together with the base word. The alphabetical system in indexes may be either letter-by-letter or word-by-word, the first being easier for the indexer and the second for the reader. In smaller sized indexes, it makes little difference to the ordering. For the alphabetization of names beginning with da, de, di, Mac, St, van and von, see individual headings."

		"title": "alphabet",
		"explanation":"The alphabet used for writing English and many other languages is derived from one developed by the Greeks more than 2000 years ago. The word itself confirms this, being made up of the ancient Greek names for the first two letters: alpha + beta. Modern alphabets fall into three groups: (1) modern Greek; (2) Cyrillic; (3) Roman. Note that other writing scripts such as those used in the Middle East and India are sometimes called “alphabets,” though they developed independently of this group with their own sets of symbols. \n 1 The modern Greek alphabet with its 24 letters is most like the Greek original, and it preserves letters such as lambda, pi and rho which are extensively modified in the Roman alphabet. In Greece and elsewhere, it’s used for general communication in Greek, as well as within the Greek Orthodox Church. \n 2 The Cyrillic alphabet, is used for several Slavic languages. It was also applied to certain non-Indo-European languages such as (Outer) Mongolian. Some of its letters are deceptively like those of the Roman alphabet, but with quite different sound values. For example, P in Cyrillic represents R, and C is S. \n 3 The Roman alphabet is the written medium for all the languages of western Europe, and some in eastern Europe. It is also the standard medium for writing languages of all kinds in North and South America, in southern Africa, as well as some in Southeast Asia, in Australia and the Pacific. The original Roman alphabet was expanded in early modern times with the addition of the letters j, v and w (the first derived from i, and the second and third from u, which had been both consonant and vowel). Its range is also extended by the accents or diacritics added to particular letters in various languages. See further under accents."

		"title": "alright or all right",
		"explanation":"The spelling alright is controversial for emotional rather than linguistic or logical reasons. It was condemned by Fowler in a 1924 tract for the Society for Pure English, despite its recognition in the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) as increasingly current. But the fury rather than the facts of usage seem to have prevailed with most usage commentators since. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) maintains its detachment with the note that it is a frequent spelling, and its stance is underwritten by more than 8000 citations in the BNC, many from written and edited sources as well as transcriptions of speech. CCAE also has ample examples in everyday reporting, narrative and quoted speech, illustrating its use in familiar idioms such as doing alright, feeling alright and work out alright. \n Dictionaries which simply crossreference alright to all right (as the “proper” form) typically underrepresent its various shades of meaning as a discourse signal. It may be concessive, as in Alright, I’ll come with you – or diffident, as in How’re things? Oh alright – or impatient as in Alright, alright! None of those senses is helpfully written as all right, which injects the distracting sense of “all correct.” Those who would do away with alright prefer to ignore its various analogues, such as almost, already, also, although, altogether, always, which have all over the centuries merged into single words. Objections to alright are rarely justified, as Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes, and Burchfield (1996) only makes a shibboleth of it. The strength and diversity of its use in Britain correlates with the comment of Webster’s Third (1986) for America, that it is “in reputable use.” At the turn of the millennium, alright is there to be used without any second thoughts."

		"title": "also",
		"explanation":"This adverb performs several grammatical roles which are uncontroversial. Also typically appears in mid-sentence, putting the spotlight on a neighboring word while making longer-range connections: \n With their usual skepticism they also questioned the figures. \n John and Jeanette also will be there. \n I will also argue that editors need better recognition. \n Grammatically speaking, also is an adjunct in the first sentence, a subjunct in the second, and a conjunct in the third (see adverbs section 1). But when also appears as a conjunct at the start of a sentence, it raises questions: \n Also not clear is whether any of the mothers received steroids. . . \n Also, some groups may have so many interconnections that such an approach is impossible. \n This prominent use of also has been subject to censure, though more in the UK than the US. According to Fowler (1926), it gave a “slovenly” feel to the sentence, as of careless afterthought not properly integrated by the writer. It could be said of the second example above, but not the first, where it’s a calculated inversion of normal word order. In both, also helps to signal an additional point, as often in academic argument. Examples from the Survey of English Usage corpus were mostly in “private speech” by London academics (Taglicht, 1984). Yet Burchfield (1996) – echoing Fowler – associates it with “uneducated speech.” The fact is that there are over 6000 instances of sentence-initial also in written sources in the BNC, in both monographs and serials (about 5% of all instances of the word). The Longman Grammar (1999) shows that the overall frequency of also is much lower in ordinary conversation than in news or academic writing. So the stylistic complaints about also seem to be misguided, along with the underlying grammatical assumptions. As a conjunct it can legitimately be used at the start of a sentence; and on the evidence there’s little reason to question its purposefulness."

		"title": "alternative or alternate",
		"explanation":"These words are a shifty pair. Both involve the idea of “the other” from the Latin stem alter embedded in them, and in older usage both meant “the other one of a pair.” The alternative plan would imply there were only two to choose between, just as alternate years means “in every second year.” But the strict sense of alternation is now much less central to alternative, and mostly confined to scientific and numerical uses of alternate and its derivatives, as in alternating current. In current usage both alternate and alternative are extending themselves as adjectives along similar lines. As nouns they are increasingly different. \n Alternative now often refers to a set of more than two options, as recent dictionaries acknowledge. The alternative fuel vehicle is one that runs on anything other than petrol/gasoline. The possibility of several options is strongly associated with the noun alternative as well, as in one of several alternatives and a number of alternatives, recurrent phrases in the BNC. De Bono allows for “195 alternatives” in his Atlas of Management Thinking (1990). \n The adjective alternate is also registered with the meaning “offering choice” in Webster’s Third (1986), without comment. Its use in official English in postwar Britain is registered in a complaint of Gowers (1954), though the Oxford Dictionary (1989) labels it “US.” British resistance to it continues – as far as New Oxford (1998) is concerned. Its usage note reports that although the reading program found alternate used to mean “offering choice” in 25% of all instances of the word, this was “still regarded as incorrect by many.” British use of alternate is nevertheless exemplified in its use in a variety of phrases in the BNC, such as alternate source of income, alternate harvesting systems, alternate means of transport. Using alternate for this sense of alternative is recognized in Australia, as in alternate routes to Adelaide from the Macquarie Dictionary (1991), and it’s current in Canada also (Canadian English Usage, 1997). Clearly the trend is worldwide. \n The most recent development for alternative and alternate is their use as adjectives to refer to a social or cultural practice which is different from that of the conventional mainstream culture. This use of alternative is registered in both the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s (1986); and it’s illustrated in BNC examples such as: \n Alternative methods of pain relief such as acupuncture and hypnosis are not generally available on the NHS. \n It appears in alternative bookshop/medicine/ technology, not to mention the alternative look [of a hairstyle] with dashes of golden copper lights . . . added to the longer areas at the top and sides. Alternate too is now being used in this sense, as in alternate lifestyle magazine. According to Webster’s English Usage (1989), the sense has been around since the 1960s, and it’s acknowledged through crossreference in Merriam-Webster (2000). New Oxford (1998) knows about it but keeps it at arm’s length: “chiefly North American.” The constraining influence of etymology (which has delayed recognition of the new meanings for alternative) seems now to be operating on alternate. Yet alternate and alternative do seem to share the same adjectival roles, and, not surprisingly, the shorter synonym recommends itself to many. \n The noun alternate stands apart from all this, used to mean “someone who substitutes for another in the performance of duties.” From its origins in theatre to refer to the understudy for a stage actor, it serves around the world in a variety of bureaucratic and legal contexts as well as the sporting arena."

Aluminum was Sir Humphrey Davy’s name for the metal, and it has remained the standard spelling in the US (see Webster’s Third, 1986); and also in Canada, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). But in the UK it quickly changed to aluminium, which was felt to have a more “classical” sound than aluminum, according to the Oxford Dictionary citation from 1812. No-one could deny its consistency with the names of other elements such as potassium, chromium and zirconium.

The words are Latin plurals, with alumnus as the singular form for alumni, and alumna for alumnae. (See further under -us, and -a section 1.) \n Alumnus and alumna are literally the “foster child” of the alma mater “fostering mother,” as universities and colleges have been called since C17 – making them the ultimate extended family. Such families are extended even further in American usage, where alumni can be associated with all kinds of training institutions, from the US Naval Academy to the Henry Park Primary School."

		"title": "a.m., am, A.M., AM or AM",
		"explanation":"This is the standard abbreviation for times that occur from midnight to midday. It stands for the Latin phrase ante meridiem, literally “before noon.” Like other lower case abbreviations, a.m. is often punctuated with stops, in line with regular practice in both the US and the UK (see abbreviations, sections 2 [a], [b] and [c].) Without stops, am could just be mistaken for the first person verb (I) am. But it’s rather unlikely, given that the the time reference is almost always accompanied by numbers, as in 10 am. In British data from the BNC, times expressed with am (unstopped) are always in the majority over those with a.m., though both forms are current. The American convention of printing the abbreviation in small caps, as 10 AM, also makes the stops unnecessary. When small caps are unavailable, full caps may be used. The Chicago Manual (1993) recognized the stopless practice alongside its own preferred policy of using stops (10 A.M.) in all kinds of abbreviations. Both stopped and stopless forms are used in Canad`a (Editing Canadian English, 2000) – as in Australia, though the government Style Manual (2002) recommends the stopless lower case forms. \n What time is 12 a.m.? The Latin makes it “12 before noon,” and therefore “midnight,” whereas people used to translating a.m. as “in the morning,” would think of it as “12 noon.” Using 12 noon or 12 midnight prevents any ambiguity. The Chicago Manual (2003) notes the use of 12 M for “12 noon,” where M is again Latin meridies (“midday”) – while indicating that it’s rarely used. It would certainly help with “noon,” but there’s no parallel abbreviation for “midnight.” The ultimate remedy is to use the “twenty-four hour clock” which makes 12 midnight into 24:00, though it’s still mostly reserved for itineraries and institutional schedules. \n To separate the hours from the minutes in a time reference, a colon is used in North American style, as in 12:05 am (i.e. just after midnight). British and Australian style use a stop, as in 12.05 am. \n ♦ For the use of AM for “amplitude modulation,” see under FM. \n  ♦ Compare p.m. or pm."

As those examples show, it carries the sense of unsettled values, likely to switch from one alternative to the other. \n The prefix amphi- is the equivalent in Greek loanwords, such as amphibian, amphora and amphitheatre. In these words the prefix simply implies “both sides.” The amphibian lives on both sides of the high-water mark; an amphora has handles on both sides; and the amphitheatre has its audience both in front and behind, in fact, all around."

		"title": "ambience or ambiance",

The French spelling ambiance once enjoyed a more esoteric existence in the realms of artistic criticism, as a word for the setting or context of a piece of art or music. But it too is used like ambience in current American and British English. Database examples have it applied to decor as in warehouse ambiance and hot tropical ambiance, and sometimes more abstractly as in competitive ambiance and an ambiance of war and hatred. Both spellings are well used in the US, though data from CCAE puts ambiance ahead of ambience in the ratio of about 5:2. The opposite holds in the UK, judging by BNC data in which ambience is far more common than ambiance. The two spellings are nevertheless recognized by New Oxford (1998), as by Merriam-Webster (2000) – leaving writers an uncommon freedom to use either."

		"title": "ambiguity",
		"explanation":"This word is often used in the general sense of “uncertainty of meaning” or “fogginess of expression.” More literally it means “capacity for dual interpretation” – an expression which leaves the reader swinging between two possible meanings. Ambiguity in the second sense can occur in a single phrase, as for example in progressive anarchy. (Does it mean “anarchy which leads to progress” or “anarchy which gets worse and worse?”) Classified advertisements can generate ambiguity in what they juxtapose, as in: \n Free to good home: 4-year-old rottweiler, good guard dog, eats anything, loves children \n Potential owners might be warned, though the advertiser was no doubt unaware of the ambiguity. The same goes for the pharmacist whose slogan was: WE DISPENSE WITH CARE. Less amusing are the cases of bad writing, as in the review of a movie whose makers were concerned with men trying to understand women. “They have no idea what they are all about” says the reviewer. We’re confused too! The cure for such ambiguities lies in rewording the sentence or rearranging its components. \n Yet ambiguity is also used creatively and deliberately. A classic study of it in English literature is Empson’s Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930); and modern advertisers and copywriters use it to stimulate and hold their readers. The tension between two competing meanings engages the mind, especially when both are applicable in the context. For example, in the headline: \n Why public servants are revolting \n And in the slogan of a used-car salesman: \n We give you a Good Deal \n Ambiguity of this kind works rather like double entendre, except that neither of the meanings generated is risqu´e. (See double entendre.)"

		"explanation":"The Americas take their name from Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian astronomer and navigator who sailed under the Spanish flag, and in 1497 explored the Atlantic coast of what we now know as South America (Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina). Ten years later, a German map-maker attached the name America to the coastline Vespucci had charted. Vespucci was the first to discover continental America, so it was christened in his honor, even though Columbus reached the Caribbean islands in 1492. \n For many people, America means “the United States of America,” not the whole of North America, let alone Central and South America. (See also Latin America.) The citizens of the United States usually refer to themselves as Americans, and America the beautiful does not seem to include Canada. Canadians, in fact, prefer not to be thought of as Americans, so the feeling is mutual. This book indicates wherever possible whether the usage described is specifically associated with the United States, or common throughout English-speaking North America (= North American). \n ♦ For use of US and the USA, see USA."

		"title": "American English",
		"explanation":"This variety of English now has the largest body of first-language speakers in the world. It originated with pockets of English settlers on the Atlantic seaboard of North America: a small group from the West country who took land in Virginia in 1607, and the better known “Pilgrim Fathers,” many of them from East Anglia, who settled in New England in 1620. Those English communities evolved into the “Thirteen Colonies,” though it was a narrow coastal settlement by comparison with the vast areas to the north, west and south which were then under French and Spanish control. But within 200 years, the English-speaking immigrants had acquired a mandate for the whole continent, and English was the common language. \n The American Declaration of Independence from Britain in 1776 meant much more than political separation. Linguistic independence was also a felt need, and its outstanding spokesman, Noah Webster, issued a series of publications proposing language reforms from 1783 on. The movement also found expression in the phrase “the American language,” first recorded in the US Congress in 1802. In his Compendious Dictionary of the English Language (1806), Webster urged Americans to detach themselves from English literary models. The dictionary enshrined spellings that now serve to distinguish American from British English, such as color, fiber and defense. (See further under -or, -re and -ce/-se.) Webster’s later and much larger American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) included many Americanisms, words borrowed from Indian languages, e.g. caribou, moccasin, tomahawk, wigwam, and ones created in North America out of standard English elements, e.g. land office, log house, congressional, scalp (verb). \n American English is distinctive also in its loans from other European languages represented on the continent. From Dutch come boss, cookie and waffle, from French chowder and gopher, and from Spanish plaza and tornado. These various kinds of Americanisms are the unique contribution of the New World to English at large, documented in the Dictionary of American English (1938–44) and especially the Dictionary of Americanisms (1951). Other major dictionaries of C20 were the American Heritage (1969), Random House (1966) and Webster’s Second and Third International dictionaries (1934, 1961), each of which published later editions. \n The distinctiveness of American English can also be seen in countless expressions for material and technological innovations of C19 and early C20. American use of gas, kerosene, phonograph and tire contrasts with the British petrol, paraffin, gramophone and tyre. American English remained untouched by spelling modifications which were fostered in British English during C19, hence its preference for check, curb, disk and racket, where British English has cheque, kerb, disc and racquet for certain applications of those words. Other examples where American English preserves an older spelling are aluminum, defense, distill and jewelry (rather than aluminium, defence, distil and jewellery). \n Across the American continent, dialect variations are to be found, particularly in pronunciation and the vernacular vocabulary such as teeter-totter v. see-saw, and fairing off v. clearing up. Words like these link people’s speech with particular regions – broadly speaking the South, the mid-West, and the North / Northern Inland. The mapping of geographical variants began in 1928 with the Linguistic Atlas projects in various regions. It continued with nationwide surveys for the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE ) in the 1960s, and sociolinguistic research of the 1970s, emphasizing social and ethnic dialects in American cities. In the 1990s, the need to synthesize regional and social data on variation was matched by more sophisticated computer resources, illuminating the demography of American dialects as never before. The social significance of dialect has also been highlighted in nationwide debates on the kinds of English to be used and taught in the classroom, centring on Michigan in the 1970s and California in the 1990s. (See further under Black English.) \n A notional standard American English underlies the written form across the continent, and is relatively uniform, except when the writer wishes to conjure up a local or colloquial voice. This is not to say that Americans do not differ on points of written usage, as they have always done. The liberal views of Webster on things such as the use of whom and shall v. will contrast with the strictures of school grammarians of C19, the archetypal Miss Fidditch and Miss Thistlebottom. Usage books of C20 present the same wide range of opinion, some allowing American usage to distance itself from accepted British usage (e.g. on whether bad can be an adverb), and others seeking to bring it back into line with British English. The seminal American English Grammar published (1940) by Charles Fries, uses descriptive and inductive techniques to account for American English as it actually is. \n American English is often more regular than British, as in the use of stops in most abbreviations, and the rules for deploying final punctuation in relation to quotation marks. (See abbreviations section 2a and quotation marks section 3c.) Other areas of difference beween American and British are indicated under punctuation."

		"title": "amid, amidst, among or amongst",
		"explanation":"These four prepositions share much the same grammatical functions these days, but differ somewhat in their regional distribution and their applications. Overall the shorter forms (amid and especially among) are much more frequent than the longer ones, as the relative percentages show in both British and American databases. \n The rarity of amid and amidst in British English helps to make them the literary and formal options for among/amongst. In American English amongst is also very uncommon, and the only one in general use is among. \n The choice between among and amongst, according to Fowler (1926), turned on whether the following word began with a vowel. He was extrapolating from a small set of C19 citations from the Oxford Dictionary (1989) where amongst was preferred. The idea is not supported by much larger amounts of contemporary data from the BNC, where among and amongst had very similar ratios of vowels to consonants following (both about 1:7). Contrasting examples such as among other things / amongst others are indifferent to the sound following, so the explanation clearly cannot be phonetic. The following example would suggest that writers may use both for “elegant” variation: \n The Group of 15...held a summit meeting in Caracas, Venezuela on Nov. 27–29, attended by, amongst others, the heads of government of India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Senegal. . . :third world debt and protectionism among industrialised countries featured prominently in the discussion. \n The tenacity of amid(st), in spite of its minority status in both American and British English, can be explained in terms of its semantics and grammar. In fact it seems to be more versatile than among(st), expressing relationships in space and the social environment, as well as abstract contexts for which among(st) is unsuitable. \n The table shows that among(st) is grammatically restricted. Effectively it can be used with plural nouns, and collective singular ones like militia which comprise a number of similar, countable entities. Publicity is ambiguous, and lends itself to among(st) only if the context makes it a series of press releases, rather than an abstraction. Abstract concepts like speculation, silence and landscape are mass nouns rather than collective ones, and do not lend themselves to among(st) at all. It seems that amid(st) works with both mass and countable nouns, whereas among(st) goes only with the latter. (See further under count nouns.) \n ♦ Compare while or whilst."

Database evidence now runs very strongly in favor of amok. It outnumbers amuck by about 12:1 in the BNC, and by 25:1 in American data from CCAE. \n The spelling amok is closer to the original Malay word amoq meaning “frenzied,” while amuck reflects the way it was and is commonly pronounced, at least outside the UK. Dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster (2000), the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie (1997) still give priority to the pronunciation with “muck” as the second syllable, whereas New Oxford (1998) gives the pronunciation with “mock” – more consistent with the now dominant spelling.

		"title": "ampersand",
		"explanation":"This word covers a variety of symbols used to represent the word “and.” In official names and company titles, it has a shape like the figure 8, as in Marks & Spencer’s. Its alternative older shape looks like the Greek epsilon: & , as in Beaumont & Fletcher. Both these forms have been available in printing, though only the first is common on typewriters and wordprocessors. In handwriting many people use a form like a cursive plus-sign: , as in bread butter. \n The ampersand is not now used for general purposes in printed text, but replaced by “and” itself. It occurs only in references to: \n 1 corporations, e.g. P & O, and publishing companies, e.g. Harper & Row. \n 2 statutes and parliamentary acts, as in Acts of Settlement 12 & 13. \n 3 the joint authors of a work, as in Gilbert & Sullivan, Rodgers & Hammerstein. \n The third point is the only case where you might actually introduce an ampersand into a text: to clarify pairs of authors when there’s a string of names mentioned in quick succession. There is otherwise no need to use ampersand when citing joint authors in text or parentheses – though British editors have made a practice of inserting ampersands into parenthetic references (Copy-editing, 1993). Current editorial practice in both the UK and the US is to restrain the use of ampersands, and to “silently” replace them with “and” (Ritter, 2002). The Chicago Manual (2003) recommends removing ampersands from the titles of published works. Style manuals agree on the need to retain ampersand in corporate names, although the Chicago Manual relaxes this for the names of publishing companies listed in bibliographies (e.g. Harper and Row), so long as consistency is maintained for all company names. Ampersand is to be avoided when citing the names of persons involved jointly in a legal case (Butcher, 1993), lest the litigants seem to be a company. \n The word ampersand is hybrid Latin, a telescoping of “and per se and” which can only be translated as “& by itself makes ‘and’.” It records the fact that for centuries ampersand stood at the end of the list of alphabetic symbols A–Z in school primers – as the final symbol which in itself represented a whole word. No doubt the list was chanted in many a C19 classroom, and the word “ampersand” stands as a monument to rote learning."

See for example: \n Elizabethan Gregorian Hungarian \n Lutheran Mexican Mohammedan \n  Republican Roman San Franciscan \n Tibetan \n As these examples show, the suffix may be simply added to the end, or may replace a final -e or -o in such words. If the final letter is -y it changes to i before the suffix. (See further under -e and -y>-i-.) In many cases, the suffix coincides with the final -a of a name, as in: \n Alaskan Asian Australian Estonian \n Indian Jamaican Persian Romanian \n Ukrainian Spartan Syrian Victorian \n Because the resulting ending is quite often -ian (as in Asian), the -an suffix has given birth to -ian as a suffix in its own right. It is common with proper names, as in: \n  Bostonian Brazilian Canadian Christian \n Darwinian Freudian Miltonian Natalian \n Wagnerian \n The -ian suffix also appears in some ordinary adjectives, such as mammalian and reptilian, and a good many nouns referring to roles and professions: \n  grammarian guardian musician optician \n physician politician \n Note that a number of similar-looking words like comedian, historian, librarian are really examples where a final y has become i before the suffix -an. \n One other variant of this suffix is -ean, which belonged originally to a number of classical words: \n Antipodean Chaldean Epicurean \n  European Herculean Mediterranean \n Procrustean Promethean \n For these, and for Jacobean and Singaporean, -ean is the only possible spelling. Note however that several others may be spelled either -ean or -ian: \n Argentinean/Argentinian, \n Aristotelean/Aristotelian, \n Boolean/Boolian, \n Caesarean/Caesarian, \n Hermitean/Hermitian, \n Shakespearean/Shakespearian. \n For most of them -ian is now the most common ending, but see under individual headings."

Elsewhere in the world, in the US, Canada and Australia, analog is usual in electronic applications of the word, such as analog computer, analog gauges, and often found in chemical applications as in the highly processed seafood analog used primarily for imitation crab, from CCAE. For nontechnical uses, Americans (though not Canadians or Australians) use both analog and analogue. Compare examples such as speed listening as an analog to speed reading with a musical analogue to Esperanto.

		"title": "analogy",
		"explanation":"This is a matter of the perceived likeness between things. Analogies work rather like metaphors in poetry, but are used in speaking and writing either to explain something, or to bring the audience to a particular point of view. An imaginative geography teacher might explain how a cyclone moves by analogy with the way spaghetti behaves when you twirl it up a fork. The parliamentarian who is keen to lower the speed limit for jumbo-sized trucks or semitrailers might refer to them as “juggernauts of the highway.” As the second example shows, an analogy may embody a judgement (positive or negative), which gives it persuasive force. The word juggernaut projects the vehicle as something enormous, primitive and harsh, which mows down everything in its path. \n A false analogy is one which suggests conclusions which are misleading or inappropriate to the topic. Take for example the suggestion that crosscultural communication is like a game between people who are playing badminton on one side of the net and tennis on the other. This analogy works only in a light-hearted context. Where there are serious concerns about crosscultural misunderstanding, it distorts and trivializes the issues, implying that they can be reduced to a set of sporting rules, and one side just has to agree to work by the rules of the other."

We shall go on to the end. \n We shall fight in France. . . \n Rhetorical anaphora is also found in any phrasal pattern repeated with strategic variation, as in Lincoln’s hope: \n . . . that government of the people, for the people, by the people, shall not perish from this earth. \n *For grammarians anaphora is a semantic relationship between two successive noun phrases which refer to the same thing. Thus a pronoun is anaphoric to its antecedent: \n He popped the question and she made the most of it. \n There the pronoun it harks back to “the question,” and he and she to persons mentioned in earlier sentences. Anaphora normally refers back to something previously mentioned, although the opposite, i.e. forward-looking anaphora (called cataphora) can be set up – at least within the same sentence: \n On its arrival in Bangkok, the aircraft was cordoned off \n In that example its anticipates “aircraft” and is cataphoric to it. \n The concept of anaphora is sometimes used of the relationship between the tenses of successive verbs, or verbs and adverbial expressions of time, where one creates the context or a reference point for the second: \n The boss had fired the secretary and installed a personal assistant. \n After the weekend I shall be in Frankfurt. \n Anaphora is a vital element in the cohesion of discourse, and in maintaining the consistency of meanings in it.

		"title": "-ance/-ence",

Usually there’s no option, and only one spelling will do. But the previous letters or sounds often serve as a clue, to save you reaching for the dictionary. With any of the following, the spelling is -ence: \n -cence (with the first c pronouced “s”) innocence magnificence reticence \n gence (with the g pronounced “j”) \n convergence diligence indulgence \n -quence consequence eloquence sequence \n -scence convalescence effervescence fluorescence \n When other letters come before the ending, the spelling (-ance or -ence) can sometimes be settled through related words where the doubtful syllable is stressed. So to get preference correct, think preferential. The same technique works for: \n confidence deference difference essence \n influence penitence providence prudence \n reference reverence sentence \n For -ance words, a related word ending in -ate or -ation can help you to get some of them right. So dominance can be reliably spelled by thinking of dominate or domination. The same technique works for: \n luxuriance radiance significance tolerance and many others. \n Two small groups require special attention, because of their sheer perversity: \n assistance resistance \n versus \n existence insistence persistence subsistence \n By rights they should all have -ence because they go back to the same Latin stem. But the French were inclined to spell them all with -ance, and their legacy remains in the first pair. Would that the classical respellers of the English Renaissance had done a more thorough job on this set (see spelling section 1), or that dictionaries permitted us to spell them either way. \n A very few words may be spelled with either -ence or -ance. They include dependence/dependance and independence/independance. The spelling with -ance is in each case more common in the US (see further under dependent). The same is true for ambience/ambiance (see under that heading). \n ♦ For variation between -ance and -ancy, or -ence and -ency, see -nce/-ncy. \n  ♦ For the choice between -ence and -ense, see -ce/-se."

Academic writers make much use of and to connect words and phrases, according to the Longman Grammar (1999); whereas in everyday writing and speech, and is more often used to coordinate clauses. Because it simply adds something to whatever went before, speakers can easily build ideas with it on the run. A vital element in the breathless narratives of children, it also helps impromptu speech-makers: \n “Now let me tell you a little about the background to this proposal and the petition. And before I address the question of how best to . . . ” \n As the example shows, and can just as readily appear at the start of a sentence as in the middle, although this has raised the eyebrows of prescriptivists and teachers for decades. “It’s wrong to use and at the start of a sentence,” they say. Their judgement is based on a very literal interpretation of the role of a conjunction – that it must conjoin things within a sentence, and cannot, should not, must not link things across sentence boundaries. Grammarians now recognize that and can be used as a conjunct, to provide a semantic link with the previous sentence. (See conjunctions and conjuncts, and coherence or cohesion.) \n To use and repeatedly at the start of a sentence would be stylistically unfortunate. Like but, it or any other word, it quickly becomes monotonous and predictable. Yet there can be stylistic or rhetorical reasons for repeating and: \n He commanded the multitude to sit down and took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.

The familiarity of the -ism ending, and the interchangeability of y and i in English spelling no doubt helped to create and support aneurism for quite some time (see i/y).

Americans make little use of the word, by the dearth of evidence from CCAE, but according to Webster’s Third (1986) use annex for all applications of the word. \n Annex(e) has effectively been twice-borrowed from French into English. The original loanword was put to legal purposes, trimmed down to annex for both noun and verb before 1700. It was reborrowed as annexe in C19 for architectural uses. Who knows if the French spelling helps to grace the drawings of a not-altogether-graceful extension?"

The ratio of annoint to anoint on the internet (just on 1:15, by a Google search in 2002) – means the spelling isn’t to be taken for granted.

		"title": "-ant/-ent",
		"explanation":"These suffixes are alike in sound and meaning, and both are found in common adjectives and nouns. Yet for most words, convention has made one or other the only one acceptable. For some, the standard spelling can be predicted from the letters or sounds immediately before the ending. \n The following groups are always spelled with -ent: \n -cent (when c is pronounced “s”) magnificent \n -gent (when g is pronounced “j”) diligent \n intelligent \n -quent eloquent \n -scent evanescent obsolescent \n Note that the words fitting these patterns always have at least two syllables before the ending. These apart, a word’s spelling may be predicted from related words whose pronunciation makes the elusive vowel unmistakable. The sound of accidental would put you right on accident, and consonantal helps with consonant. \n A very small number of these words can appear with either -ant or -ent. They are typically ones which work as both adjectives and nouns, like dependent/dependant (see further under that heading). In such cases writers may, as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) suggests, reserve the -ent for the adjective, and use -ant for the noun. But this distinction does not sit comfortably with the fact that -ant is the ending of many adjectives, or that adjectives and nouns shift into each other’s roles. Less frequent examples, such as propellant/propellent and repellent/repellant, seem to be settling arbitrarily on the first one in each case (see under those headings). \n For ascendant, defendant and descendant, the -ant spelling alone is current and used for both noun and adjective: see individual headings. \n Though both spellings survive for confidant/ confident, they present different meanings. See confident or confidant(e)."

		"title": "ante-/anti",
		"explanation":"These prefixes mean very different things. \n 1 The Greek anti- (meaning “against, opposed to”) is well established in words like: \n anticlimax anticyclone anti-intellectual antisocial \n not to mention \n antidisestablishmentarianism \n Anti- is regularly used to form new words, such as anti-abortion, anti-business, anti-government, anti-Semitism. Newer words with anti- often carry a hyphen in British English, according to New Oxford (1998), whether or not the base word begins with a capital letter (see hyphens). But Merriam-Webster (2000) shows how American English gives a solid setting from the start to most words formed with anti-, whether a vowel or consonant follows: antiabortion, antibusiness, antigovernment. Hyphens are used only before a capital letter, as in anti-Semitism. \n 2 Ante- from Latin means “before,” as in: \n antecedent antedate antediluvian antepenultimate anteroom \n  It is never hyphenated. These days it’s hardly ever used to form new words, but has yielded its place to pre- (see pre-). \n One curious exception to all the above is the word antipasto, borrowed from Italian. Though it means the things you eat before the main meal, the Italians have fixed the spelling with anti- not ante-."

		"title": "antenna",
		"explanation":"This Latin loanword has two plurals, the anglicized antennas and the latinate antennae, which have rather different applications. In both British and American English, antennas is put to specialized use in referring to the devices that receive radio, TV and satellite signals. Antennae covers the biological uses of the word in reference to the feelers of insects, snails and prawns etc. The plural antennae is also used in figurative references to that human facility to sense social and political currents in the environment, as in the following examples from the BNC and CCAE respectively: \n However decent the man, his political antennae were too insensitive. \n Children have faultless antennae for detecting when adults are serious. \n Those are the broad distinctions. However both databases harbor examples in which antennae is used for the electromagnetic device, and in CCAE about 1 example in 5 was spelled that way. The American data also provided some rare examples in which antennas was used for biological and human applications, notably Nancy Reagan saying she used “all my little antennas to ferret out White House personnel problems.” But the First Lady’s commitment to the regular English plural was heavily outweighed by the general preference (more than 90%) for antennae in this application.

		"explanation":"This remarkable word was coined by Plato, to mean “those with their feet placed opposite.” It reminds us that the Greeks of the fourth century BC understood not only that the world was round, but also that through gravity all the world’s inhabitants trod the earth in the same way, whether in the northern or southern hemisphere. Those on one side of the world therefore had their feet opposite to those on the other. Or, as Shakespeare expressed it, they were “counterfooted.” \n The word has been used of both people and places on opposite sides of the globe, and so Mongolia and Argentina are antipodes relative to each other, not just for Britain vis-`a-vis Australia and New Zealand. Strictly speaking, the word could be also used by Australians and New Zealanders in reference to Britain, although the course of history has meant it being most often used by the British in reference to Australia. Both the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986) give preference to the lower case form, although instances of Antipodes outnumbered antipodes in this application by more than 3:1 in the BNC. The capital letter serves to differentiate this specific geographical sense of the word from the generic sense of “opposite,” as in Violence and voting are antipodes. But not all writers use it."

		"title": "antivenin, antivenene, antivenine or antivenom",
		"explanation":"The spelling antivenin is given preference in the major American and British dictionaries, with antivenene offered as the lesser alternative. Antivenine is noted only in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Spelling variation between -in and -ine, and between -ine and -ene affects other chemical compounds (see -ine), but has little public impact. These three however interconnect with first aid and public safety, and health authorities in many places now endorse antivenom instead, following a recommendation of the Lancet magazine in 1979. It appears in the World Health Organization’s Committee on Venoms and Antivenoms. Antivenom is clearly more transparent, and makes for more reliable communication when life is threatened. \n The reference databases provide little evidence on any of the terms. Only antivenin could be corroborated in American data from CCAE, and none of them appears in the BNC. (Life-threatening events involving snakes are of course relatively uncommon in the British Isles – thanks to St Patrick!) An internet search (Google, 2002) confirmed that all four words are still current, though the use of antivenene is very low, and antivenine rates only a few hundred examples worldwide. By contrast antivenom and antivenin both notched up several thousand, with antivenom ahead by a factor of 7:5. Thus antivenom seems to be establishing itself – the specialists’ sensible choice has gained popular support. \n ♦ Compare flammable/inflammable."

		"title": "antonyms",
		"explanation":"These are pairs of words with opposite meanings, like wet and dry, or dead and alive. Many antonyms like wet/dry are words from opposite ends of a scale, and one can imagine intermediate stages on the scale between them, like those expressed in “rather wet” and “almost dry.” In linguistic terms they are gradable antonyms, which permit degrees of comparison (see adjectives section 2). \n Antonyms like dead/alive are also opposites, but without a continuous scale between them. If you say that an animal is “half-dead,” you are really saying that it’s still alive. In fact the use of one word entails negating its opposite: alive means “not dead,” just as dead means “not alive.” The two words complement each other in meaning and are therefore called complementary antonyms. \n A third group of antonyms, such as buy/sell, parent/child and before/after, form pairs that are not so much opposite as reciprocal in meaning. As those examples show, the words may refer to reciprocal actions or relationships, or corresponding relationships in time or space. The term for such antonyms is relational opposites, or converses. Comparative expressions, such as higher/lower also fall into this class. \n Note that all pairs of antonyms have a common denominator between them: \n wet/dry (level of moisture or saturation) \n  buy/sell (exchange of goods for money) \n So any pair of antonyms is in fact concerned with the same thing: they just take contrasting perspectives on it."

		"title": "any and any",
		"explanation":"These raise grammatical questions as well as issues of style. As an indefinite pronoun, any can stand for either singular or plural, and the verb agreement varies accordingly: \n Is any of their advice to be taken seriously? \n None of those apples. We don’t want any that are wrinkled. \n The personal pronoun agreeing with any is very often they, them, their: \n If any of the staff come, make them welcome. This use of them (they/their) with any is now the most neutral form of agreement, whatever objection may be made in terms of formal agreement (see further under they). The use of him or her in that sentence would turn it into an expectation about the sex of the staff attending. The agreement with anyone and anybody likewise frequently involves they, them, their, again maintaining the indefiniteness, and in spite of a singular verb. (See further under agreement section 3.) \n Other any-compounds are adverbs, some of which (anyhow, anymore, anyway, anywhere) are regularly set solid. The solid setting of anymore meaning “any longer” is widely used in the US and elsewhere outside the UK (Burchfield, 1996); and it contrasts usefully with the juxtaposed determiners any and more in Any more news? But anymore (as adverb) tends to be replaced by the spaced any more in formal British style. The BNC’s examples of anymore meaning “any longer” (almost 300) come from interactive or colloquial writing: \n The joke isn’t funny anymore. \n They don’t make films like his anymore. \n “Anytime, anywhere,” the note had said. \n They’ll explain it to anyone, anytime . . . \n The last two examples show how the setting of established any-compounds provides a pattern for the newer ones. Anytime appears more than 100 times in BNC data, again in informal discourse. Writers of more formal prose may wish to space out any more and any time, but it makes no difference to the adverbial meaning. \n Some any-compounds are strongly associated with American rather than British English. This is so for anymore used in positive rather than negative constructions. Compare the examples given above with Listening is a rare art anymore, where it means “nowadays.” Anyplace and anywheres are also most at home in American English, the former gaining ground as the latter seems to be losing it, according to Webster’s Dictionary of Usage (1989). The use of anybody and anyone is a further point of regional divergence: see under -one or -body."

Dictionaries often use the words as synonyms for each other, yet there are aspects of each to differentiate. \n An aphorism is above all pithy and terse, as in Least said, soonest mended, whereas the wording of an adage has a centuries-old flavor to it: He who pays the piper calls the tune. A proverb expresses its practical wisdom in homely terms: A stitch in time saves nine. The maxim is also drawn from practical experience, but turned into a general principle and rule of conduct: People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. The axiom is the most abstract of the set, a statement embodying a recognized truth which is felt to need no proof: Crime does not pay. The wording of axioms is a little more flexible than that of the other four: it can for example be turned into the past tense. \n All five types of saying express common wisdom, and they seem to evoke a widely held set of values which can be used to bring people on side. With their more or less fixed wording, many can be invoked without even being quoted in full.

		"explanation":"This has two distinct meanings: \n 1 a punctuation mark, for which see apostrophes (next entry); \n 2 the rhetorical practice of “turning aside” (translating the Greek word as literally as one can). \n The term apostrophe was first used of dramatic speeches in which an actor, turning aside from fellow actors on stage, directs his remarks towards the audience. It may be an appeal to someone present, or an invocation to an absent party. An example of the latter is found on the lips of Shakespeare’s Antony in Julius Caesar: \n “O Cicero, thou shouldst have been present at this hour” \n In other literary works, poetry or prose, an apostrophe is any section in which the author diverts attention away from the main narrative with an invocation. In his novel Lolita, Nabokov does it with “Gentlemen of the jury,” and “Gentlewomen of the jury.”"
	},
	{
		"title": "apostrophes",
		"explanation":"As punctuation marks, apostrophes are used primarily for indicating: \n 1 the omission of a letter or letters from a word \n 2 possession or attribution \n In spite of its Greek name, the apostrophe began to be used as a punctuation mark only in C17. It was first and foremost a mark of omission, as in think’st and mislik’d, where the vowel was dropped from the verb’s suffix to maintain the rhythm of verse. Apostrophes have also been put to use with certain kinds of abbreviations in writing, e.g. C’tee for committee (see contractions section 1). \n The use of apostrophes to mark possession grew out of their use to mark omission. In earlier centuries the genitive suffix for many nouns had been -es; and though it had long been contracted to plain -s without any obvious problems of communication, C17 scholars wanted to indicate the lost letter. Some even assumed that a genitive expression like the kings castle was really a contraction of the king his castle, and so the apostrophe in the king’s castle marked the remnant of the hypothetical lost word. The oddity of this explanation for examples such as the queen’s ship – where the pronoun would have been her – seemed to escape attention. \n Apostrophes became the regular mark of possession on singular nouns during C18, and were extended to plural nouns in C19. Their sense of possession was at one time so strong that it was thought improper to say the table’s legs, because this seemed to attribute possessive powers to something inanimate. Scruples of this kind have long since gone by the board, and daily papers are full of phrases like today’s announcement and Japan’s ambassador, where the apostrophe marks association or affiliation rather than possession. \n The role of apostrophes has thus expanded in several ways over four centuries. Though no longer used for the lost verb inflection, they now serve to mark omissions and contractions of other kinds within the verb phrase, as in it’s, I’ll, we’d and John’s not here, as well as hasn’t and don’t. (See further under contractions section 2.) \n 1 Standard uses of apostrophes with nouns are as follows: \n ∗ apostrophe s for singular nouns, marking possession or attribution, as in a spectator’s car, the class’s response. It makes no difference for common nouns if they end in an s or not, whereas proper nouns ending in s may be given special treatment (see section 3 below). \n ∗ apostrophe s for plural nouns not ending in -s, such as women’s work, the mice’s squeaking. \n ∗ an apostrophe alone for the possessive of plural nouns ending in -s, as in the spectators’ cheers. \n Note that the apostrophe s is normally added to the final word of a compound possessive expression, as in mother-in-law’s tongue or Laurel and Hardy’s humor. But when a compound phrase identifies two independent possessors, the apostrophe s may be added to both, as in her father’s and mother’s names. \n  For the choice between apostrophe s and apostrophe alone in each others and other ambiguous cases, see under number. \n 2 The disappearing apostrophe. Apostrophes are not now obligatory in a number of kinds of expressions. They include: \n ∗ plural nouns in phrases which express affiliation, for example, teachers college and senior citizens centre. This C20 trend is widespread in the English-speaking world. Burchfield (1996) notes it in corporate names and titles such as Diners Club and Farmers Weekly, while The Right Word at the Right Time (1985) had already found it in British institutions such as Sports Council, Parks Department and some generic items such as trades union. In the US it’s recognized by the American Associated Press stylebook, and for corporate and institutional names (e.g. Department of Veterans Affairs) by the Chicago Manual of Style (2003). The Guide to Canadian Usage (1997) finds both older and newer practices in Teachers’ Federation and Music Educators Association. The Australian government Style Manual (2002) recommends elimination of apostrophes on plural nouns used attributively (see adjectives section 1). This makes for consistency in items such as drivers licence, girls school, proofreaders marks, where the apostrophe doesn’t mark possession – and the time spent worrying about whether it should really be driver’s licence or drivers’ licence would be better used elsewhere. But there are special cases which seem anomalous without the apostrophe s, such as Children’s Book Week (because “childrens” is not a regular form of the word), and A Visitor’s Guide to Darwin, where the plural form would seem discrepant with the preceding A(cf. Visitors Guide to Darwin). Thus context is the final arbiter as to whether apostrophes are needed, as always. \n ∗ plural expressions of time and space, such as five weeks leave (compare a week’s leave), and three kilometres distance (cf. a kilometre’s distance). Apostrophes are not critical in quantitative expressions like these, because they work attributively, like the examples discussed in the previous paragraph. The apostrophe is routinely omitted from plural quantitative nouns in US newspapers, and it’s a recognized practice for time expressions in Canada (Editing Canadian English, 2000), in the UK (Butcher, 1992), and in Australia, according to the government Style Manual (2002). \n ∗ numbers and dates, such as in his 60s, fly 767s, during the 1980s. All the regional style manuals including the Chicago Manual (2003) agree on this. Apostrophes are usually there in the plural of single numbers, as in All the 2’s and 3’s were missing. \n ∗ sets of letters, such as MPs, PhDs, IOUs. One advantage of not using the apostrophe in these plural initialisms is that it’s then available for the possessive, as in MP’s action under scrutiny. Single letters in lower case still usually mark the plural with apostrophes, as in Dot the i’s and cross the t’s. (See further under letters as words.) \n ∗ placenames involving possessive forms. Apostrophes are not required at all in placenames in the US and Australia, thanks to intervention by the Board on Geographic Names and the Geographical Names Board respectively. This action obviates the problem of unpredictable use of apostrophes in British placenames, where Kings Cross and St Albans contrast with King’s Lynn and St Martin’s, and the apostrophe stands between St Helens in Lancashire and St Helen’s on the Isle of Wight. Individual names may be checked against the British Post Office Guide, and the Oxford Atlas gazetteer. In Canada, where practice is also variable, the authority is the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names. \n ∗ company names such as Harrods, McDonalds, Woolworths. The absence (or presence) of the apostrophe is of course fixed by trademark. In Canada the 1977 Charter of the the French Language requires anglophone companies to drop the English possessive from their names when operating in Quebec. \n 3 Apostrophes with personal names ending in -s. What to do for the possessive form of proper names ending in -s has led to a variety of opinions and still-evolving practices. The earlier convention was to exempt all of them from the regular apostrophe s, and mark them with just an apostrophe, as in Jones’, Jesus’, Keats’, Robbins’ etc. This general rule has since been reduced to a few special cases: \n a) literary, classical and religious persons whose names end in s should have just the apostrophe. All others have the full apostrophe s: \n Jones’s Menzies’s Keats’ Jesus’ Xerxes’ Euripides’  \n b) literary, classical and religious persons whose names consist of two or more syllables and end in s, should have the plain apostrophe. All others have the regular apostrophe s: \n Jones’s Menzies’s Keats’s Jesus’ Xerxes’ Euripides’ \n c) any name whose last syllable is pronounced with a long “eez” sound should have just the apostrophe, whereas others have apostrophe s: \n Jones’s Menzies’ Keats’s Jesus’s Xerxes’ Euripides’ \n  d) any name whose possessive form is pronounced with the same number of syllables as the plain form should have the plain apostrophe. The application of this rule depends of course on the vagaries of pronunciation. Do most people pronounce the possessive of Jones with one or two syllables? (Perhaps it depends on who you are keeping up with!) Apart from this, rules such as (a) to (c) overlap in their application, and the outcome depends on which one prevails. British authorities such as Butcher (1992) and Hart’s Rules (1983), which admit rules based on pronunciation, effectively leave it up to the individual, which is fine if both writer and editor agree on this. \n Much greater consistency is achieved by doing away with special cases, and treating names ending in -s to the full apostrophe -s, just like any other noun. This is recommended by the Chicago Manual (2003) and the Australian government Style Manual (2002). The practice is easy to apply, and deals effectively with English and foreign names, French names ending in a silent “s,” such as Camus’s and Dumas’s, not to mention Arkansas’s. The Chicago Manual still allows for a little of conventions (a) and (c) above, and acknowledges the lingering use of the apostrophe alone after names ending in “s,” in some quarters. Canadian English Usage (1997) also recognizes the classical tradition (a), while noting that it is “always acceptable to add -s to a name that ends in s.” \n ♦ For the choice between it’s and its, see its. \n ♦ The choice between using apostrophe s and nothing at all in statements like They wouldn’t hear of Henry(’s) coming is a matter of grammar. See further under -ing. \n 4 The superfluous apostrophe. The use of apostrophes in ordinary plural words, sometimes known as the “greengrocer’s apostrophe,” is familiar in hand-written shop signs everywhere in the English-speaking world: banana’s for sale; fresh prawn’s; latest video’s. In the US, the “Great Apostrophe Plague” is noted in John Simon’s aptly named Paradigms Lost (1980). In Australia, the so-called “Apostrophe Man” keeps tabs on “apostroflation,” with a constant supply of examples to report to the Sydney Morning Herald, both downmarket (auto’s) and upmarket (gateaux’s). Superfluous apostrophes are a symptom of unedited prose and of the inexperienced writer, who is inclined to add a “flying comma” to any final s for good measure. As applications of the apostrophe begin to shrink, expert writers and editors are also less certain about its use, hence the many details of this entry. Burchfield, quoted in a 1985 news article (see Webster’s English Usage, 1989), commented that the apostrophe had probably reached the limits of its usefulness, and might only be retained for contractions. A return to C17 simplicities with the apostrophe might not be a backward step. \n   For the use/nonuse of apostrophes in locative expressions such as at the printers, see local genitive."

Some reserve appendixes for medical references to the colonic appendage, and make appendices the plural for the sections of additional material at the back of a book. Americans use both plurals for the latter, but are somewhat more inclined to use appendixes, by the evidence of CCAE where it outnumbers appendices by about 3:2 in referring to the back end of a book or report. The instances of appendices, as in found only in the appendices of history, suggest its conservation by writers with a literary bent. The American data generally lines up with Webster’s Third (1986), which puts appendixes ahead of the classical plural. British preferences are quite the opposite. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) prioritizes appendices, and its prevalance is underscored by data from the BNC, where appendices outnumbers appendixes by a factor of more than 30:1. Yet the handful of instances of appendixes referred to sections added at the back of a book or report, as they might in American English. The supposed line of demarcation between appendixes and appendices breaks down in both the US and the UK. \n  The medical operation of excising the appendix is called an appendectomy in the US and Canada. In the UK appendicectomy remains just as common, judging by their relative showing (11:6) in the BNC. But in English worldwide, the shorter form clearly dominates.

		"title": "apposition",
		"explanation":"Just what counts as apposition, and how to punctuate the phrases in apposition are the major issues. Grammarians differ over the criteria for apposition, such as whether the appositives have to be grammatically identical in form, juxtaposed, and phrased so that either could be omitted without impairing the syntax: see the Comprehensive Grammar of English (1985). In fact the three sentences below all present apposition in its strictest form. \n Swami Svaratnaram, their yoga teacher, prescribed the routines. \n She was born in Pymble, a suburb of Edinburgh. \n He ordered a martini, the drink that went with the company he kept. \n Appositives like those, being syntactically equal in rank, are effectively nonrestrictive (see relative clauses section 4). They are therefore punctuated with commas, as shown. \n Yet various familiar kinds of apposition are restrictive, in that one appositive serves to define the other, and their syntactic relationship is one of dependency. Like restrictive relative clauses, they are not separated by commas, witness: \n the soprano Kiri Ti Kanawa \n the year 2000 \n your brother James \n   the River Ganges \n the term “responsible government” \n In the regular forms of proper names, the title or descriptor may be seen as having a restrictive appositive function: Lord Mountbatten, President Eisenhower; Mount Egmont; Lake Titicaca. But when such names are glossed, as in Eisenhower, president of the US from 1953–1961, the comma marks a nonrestrictive apposition. The titles in such appositions do not need to have capital letters: see capital letters section 1d. \n A parenthesis differs from an appositive in not being grammatically matched with another constituent of the sentence (the subject, object etc.). It is therefore usually set off with brackets: see further under parenthesis."

		"title": "appraise, apprise and apprize",
		"explanation":"These spellings intersect with two distinct words. Appraise meaning “estimate the value of ” always contrasts with apprise meaning “notify.” Apprize served as a variant for appraise in older American English, and in Scottish law, but is now the American alternate for apprise, according to Merriam-Webster (2000). The chances of the two uses being confused are reduced by the fact that they are differently construed: \n The sheriff apprized the ship’s cargo. (= appraise) \n The sheriff apprized them of its value. (= apprise) \n The of construction is characteristic of apprise, whether the verb is active or passive: \n The company was apprised of the cargo’s value. Compare The ship’s cargo was appraised for its value. \n Apprise is increasingly a rather formal word, and much less common than appraise in data from CCAE and the BNC. There’s no sign of apprize in either the American or the British database. Institutional uses of appraise in assessing work performance have no doubt boosted its frequency, as well as that of the related abstract noun appraisal. It outnumbers apprisal by more than 1000:1 in the reference databases – and there are none of apprizal."

There are analogues for it, in the relationship between literate and literacy or adequate and adequacy – if it needs any explanation."

		"title": "apropos",
		"explanation":"This telescopes the French phrase a propos ` meaning “to the purpose.” As a simple adverb or adjective, apropos means “right or opportune” in relation to whatever is going on: The remark was apropos. But when followed by of and another word or phrase, e.g. apropos of the election, it sets up a prepositional phrase. At the start of an utterance apropos of is used to highlight a new topic of conversation, and therefore serves as a discourse marker (see further under that heading). It often signals a change of subject. \n Sometimes speakers change the topic of conversation more or less abruptly, with the phrase apropos of nothing. Whether the new topic is really unrelated to what went before, and entirely unmotivated, is for the listener to judge. The phrase still implies that the speaker is very conscious of altering the topic of conversation. \n Apropos is usually written as a single word, according to dictionaries everywhere in the English-speaking world. However the Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes the French form a propos ` with accent as an alternative. British and American databases provide a handful of examples in which it appears spaced as a propos, without the accent. \n ♦ See also malapropisms."

		"explanation":"The Victorian aquavivarium quickly translated itself into aquarium, and into a public and domestic institution. The English plural aquariums is strongly preferred by Americans, by its dominance of the data from CCAE. But their British counterparts use both aquariums and the Latin plural aquaria. The two plurals appear in roughly equal numbers of BNC texts – even in the same text – suggesting that the choice is quite open. See further under -um."

		"title": "-ar",
		"explanation":"This ending appears on a few nouns and many adjectives in English. The nouns are a mixed bag, representing: \n ∗ people: \n beggar burglar bursar friar  \n pedlar scholar vicar \n ∗ objects and animals: \n agar altar briar budgerigar \n calendar caterpillar cellar cigar \n collar cougar dinar dollar \n exemplar fulmar grammar hangar \n molar nectar pillar poplar \n seminar vinegar \n In some cases, the -ar is a direct legacy of medieval Latin. Bursar is from bursarius, and calendar reflects calendarium (see further under calendar or calender). Others, e.g. collar and pillar, were written with -er in earlier English and later respelled with -ar, perhaps to show that they were not agent words and that the ending was not really a suffix (see further under -er). \n The desire to differentiate homonyms probably helps to account for others like altar (as opposed to alter) and hangar (as opposed to hanger). The spelling of liar i.e. “one who tells lies,” differentiates it from the possible agent word lier (“one who lies around”). But the -ar spelling seems awkward for words like beggar and pedlar, which also look like agent words and might be expected to have -er spellings. In American English pedlar has been replaced by peddler. In fact, neither beggar nor pedlar is an agent word. Their origins are rather obscure, but they appeared fully fledged in Middle English, and the verbs beg and peddle are backformations from them (see backformation). Here again the -ar spellings show that, historically speaking, they are not agent words. \n Apart from that mixed bag of nouns, -ar is regularly found on adjectives borrowed from classical or medieval Latin. See for example: \n angular cellular circular \n crepuscular familiar globular \n insular jocular linear \n lunar muscular particular \n perpendicular planar polar \n rectangular regular singular \n solar stellar titular \n triangular vehicular vulgar \n ♦ For the choice between peninsular and peninsula, see peninsula."

		"explanation":"All three words serve as adjectives relating to the Arabian Peninsula, where the first Muslim state was established around AD 600, known now as Saudi Arabia. Arabian is used in general references to the culture and geography of the region, as in Arabian Nights and Arabian deserts. Arabic mostly refers to the language, scripts and symbols associated with Arab peoples, and is applied to the languages of countries such as Syria, Jordan, Irak, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria. Curiously, what we know as Arabic numerals originated in India, and are known by the Arabs themselves as “Indian numerals.” But Arab is now the most frequent and widely used adjective, no doubt because of the power and influence of Arabs outside Arabia itself: hence the Arab countries/leaders/nations of the Arab League."

	{
		"title": "Arabic loanwords",
		"explanation":"Words borrowed into English from Arabic languages often vary in their spelling because of their variability in the source language. Arabic words are constructed out of triliteral roots (i.e. roots consisting of three consonants), which are combined with particular vowels to form sets in the same semantic field. Thus the root ktb appears in the word for “book” as well as “write.” In fact the vowels vary somewhat from dialect to dialect, and the same word borrowed at different times and places could be differently transliterated in English. This helps to account for variants such as kabob/kebab etc., and also the active respelling of older Arabic loans such as sheik. See further under kebab, kilim, sheikh, sheriff."

The choice between archaeometry and archeometry etc. is essentially a matter of American or British spelling: see further under ae/e. \n In fact, the two prefixes seem to have developed from the same source. The Greek word arche meant both “beginning” and “principality,” just as the verb archein meant both “be first” and “govern or rule.” The two come together in archives, documents which record the origins of things, and which were kept at the Greek archeion or headquarters of the local government."

The response patterns to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) were more complex, with 25% of British respondents endorsing archeology, and more than 70% of those from Continental Europe. Around 70% of US respondents endorsed archeology, but this means a substantial minority preferred archaeology; and in American data from CCAE, archaeology outnumbered archeology in the ratio of 5:2.

		"title": "archaisms",
		"explanation":"These are words and expressions that belong to times past. Feudal relations of past centuries are embedded in liege lord and yeoman from medieval times, and distinctive socio-political roles in the emancipists and suffragettes of more recent history. References to the warming pan, chamber pot, penny farthing and horse-drawn carriage help to conjure up material aspects of earlier historical periods. Measuring distances in leagues and quoting prices in guineas have the same archaizing effect. \n Archaisms of another kind are the ordinary function words and expressions which have somehow gone out of fashion. Examples are: forsooth, methinks, howsoever and verily. They have less power to set a particular historical period, and are more likely to draw attention back to the writer and the writer’s style. They suggest a certain self-conscious use of language, which can either be effectively ironic, or annoyingly precious. The boundary between archaic and old-fashioned language is somewhat fluid and subjectively determined. Whether you class words like albeit, goodly, perchance and rejoice as archaisms or just old-fashioned words depends on individual education and experience of language. Those who read older literature are more likely to feel that such words are part of the continuum of the English language, and only a little old-fashioned. Those whose reading comes from the last decades of C20 (plus C21) will probably feel the words are archaic."

Yet computer archiving systems show archive taking on the role of verb/participle, and its use as attributive adjective can be seen in archive disks/footage/sources/tapes, among numerous examples in the databases.

The word allows writers to have it both ways, to say that “a case can be made out” without actually committing themselves to it. The equivocation takes over in some instances, as in what is merely arguably right, and the word comes closer to its negative use “capable of being disputed.” But whether distanced from or closer to a given point of view, arguably leaves the advocacy to someone else. \n ♦ For the choice between inarguably and unarguably, see inarguable."

The argument may be just a non sequitur, ad hoc, or ex silentio; and worse perhaps, goes on ad infinitum. \n A proper argument addresses the issues (argumentum ad rem), and develops either inductively (a posteriori) or deductively (a priori). We owe these Latin phrases to scholars in rhetoric and philosophy between C16 and C18 (see individual heading for more about each). A few other argumentative tactics and tricks go by English names, for example: begging the question, and posing a leading question. (See also under analogy, and fallacies.) \n The spelling of argument (minus the -e of argue) looks like an exception to the rule for words formed with -ment (see under -e).

		"title": "-aroo",
		"explanation":"This jokey suffix probably owes something to trans-Pacific contact in both C19 and C20.

The journal American Speech (Bolinger, 1941) found the source for -aroo in Spanish, as naturalized in the American word buckaroo and its Spanish counterpart vaquero “cowboy.” Bolinger noted “coincidental support” from the Australian word kangaroo, providing the word with its bouncy overtones. Yet it seems significant that -aroo became highly productive during World War II, at just the time when American servicemen enjoyed R and R (“rest and recreation”) in Australia. \n For Australians, -aroo is a neutral element of Aboriginal origin, found in the names of fauna and flora, including kangaroo, wallaroo, calgaroo, willaroo, and in placenames in several eastern states: Coorparoo (QLD), Gundaroo (NSW), Liparoo (VIC). It is also the formative element in jackaroo, the C19 Australian word for a “farmhand,” as well as jillaroo, his C20 female counterpart. The coincidental uses of jackaroo and buckaroo suggest early trans-Pacific communication, though scanty evidence makes it hard to say in which direction the influence operated. Later Australian and New Zealand (NZ) formations of the 1940s, such as jambaroo, jigamaroo, shivaroo belong to the wartime vogue for -aroo, and mimic the American coinages. Both in the US and Australia, some were spelled with -eroo (see under that heading). Most were too transient to become standardized one way or the other."

		"title": "around and round",
		"explanation":"Large differences in the regional frequencies of these two set the scene. As adverb or preposition, around is much commoner than round in American English, by more than 40:1 in the Brown corpus. In British English they come much closer but the majority goes the other way, with round outnumbering around by just 7:6 in the LOB corpus. Round has uses as an adjective (a round face), a noun (theatre in the round) and verb (she rounded on him), none of which are fulfilled by around. But around is the American preference for several adverb and prepositional uses which might be performed by round or other words in British English. Compare: \n He looked around the room / round the room. \n They hadn’t seen anyone around/about. \n A shield of prayer was thrown around him / round him. \n In fact around is now common enough in such applications among British writers, as Burchfield (1997) demonstrates. Even the use of around to mean “approximately” is far from being distinctly American usage. There was no statistically significant difference in data from the Brown and LOB corpora on this point (see Peters, 1998a). Examples from LOB such as a crowd of around 30,000 and the price rose to around $253 show that this use of around to mean “approximately” is at home in Britain."

		"explanation":"Collocations such as arrant knave and knight errant give an antique flavor to both of these adjectives, yet both have some current uses. The sense of “wandering/straying” was once common to both, and remains in both physical and figurative uses of errant. British data from the BNC presents examples such as errant feelings/temper as well as an errant foot and the errant strand of hair. But by far the commonest use is in reference to persons who are in some way out of line, and there is mild censure in errant husband, errant secretary, errant citizen etc. Other errant persons in American data from CCAE included the errant sailor/builder/doctor/lawyer and arbitrageur. Both databases have errant used in reference to stray bullets, but Americans apply it more freely to a vehicle which has gone off track, whether bus, light-plane or satellite, and to devices which play up, such as computers, radio transmitters and even domestic alarms. American English also makes much more use of errant in reporting on misdirected shots by golfers and other sportsmen. \n In arrant the sense of waywardness is now overlaid with heavy censure. Its only surviving roles are as an intensifier of usually negatively toned nouns, particularly arrant nonsense, though in BNC data it also goes with sexism, rudeness, hypocrisy and mischief-making. Arrant coward and arrant coxcomb show more direct censure of the person, as does arrant anti-Semite from CCAE. Yet arrant makes little showing in either database. The few British examples seem hoary with age, and the mere handful of American ones put it close to extinction. Further evidence of its decline can be seen in mistaken uses of errant for arrant in each database: errant nonsense, an errant traitor. Here and elsewhere, errant is gaining ground."

The phrase is wonderfully enigmatic, and can be quoted either to invoke a lofty aestheticism, or to justify irresponsible artistic activity. It serves as the motto of MGM films, displayed at the start of each movie along with the roaring lion.

		"title": "articles",
		"explanation":"This is a grammatical term for two kinds of words: the definite article the and the indefinite article a/an. \n Articles are the commonest words on the page: almost every English sentence has one. Yet their role and meaning is subtle, and often a problem for people learning English as a second language. \n The prime function of articles is to signal that a noun is to follow, sooner or later. See for example: \n the brown fox \n the proverbially quick brown fox \n an expensive state-of-the-art sports car \n Articles normally come first in the noun phrase. However both a and the can be preceded by predeterminers (see under determiners); and the by bulkier quantifiers such as one of, some of, none of. \n The chief difference between definite and indefinite articles is in the specifications they put on the following noun. The indefinite article indicates that the noun is being mentioned for the first time in the discourse in which it occurs. See for example: \n On my way through Hong Kong, I bought a camera. \n Compare the effect of the definite article: \n When I showed the camera to customs, they charged me 33% duty. \n Using the word the implies that you have already referred to the object or concept in question. In this case, “the camera” must be the one bought in Hong Kong. It isn’t any camera, but one for which some specific information has already been supplied. \n Note however that writers can supply that specific information immediately after the noun in question, as in: \n The camera which I bought in Hong Kong cost me 33% duty. \n Still the use of the implies that the noun will be detailed in the immediate context. The chief exceptions are universal and generic uses of the definite article, such as the air and the tiger is an endangered species (see the section 2). Those apart, the definite article is one of various devices which make for cohesion in English. (See further under the and coherence or cohesion.) \n The use and choice of articles differs slightly in some regions of the English-speaking world. Where Americans speak of being at the university or in the hospital, the British would say at university or in hospital. Use of the definite article varies within the UK – being less used in northern dialects than in the south. The selection of a or an for the indefinite article is less predictable in the US than in the UK. In American speech a may be used instead of an before words beginning with a vowel sound: a area, a oven. See further under a or an."

Data from the BNC confirms that artefact is now more common and more widely used in British English, by a factor of 6:1; whereas CCAE data shows that in American English artifact is used almost exclusively. \n The word has few close relatives in English, the nearest being artifice and artificial. The analogy with those no doubt helps to maintain artifact, whereas artefact has little to support it but closeness to the original Latin arte facto (“made by art”)."

		"title": "-ary/-ery/-ory",
		"explanation":"In British pronunciation, these three suffixes all sound alike. Whether the vowel is a, e or o, it is pronounced as an indeterminate vowel (schwa) or eliminated entirely, and offers no clue to the spelling. American pronunciation meanwhile puts more stress on the first vowel of the suffix, and the sound is quite clearly one vowel or the other. Compare American and British ways of saying dormitory and secretary. Without the American pronunciation to help, grammar and meaning are the best way to sort them out. \n Check first whether the word is an adjective or a noun. \n *If it is an adjective, the ending is either -ary or -ory. Overall there are fewer ending in -ory. To discover which ones should be spelled -ory, have a look at the letters preceding the suffix. If they are -at, -ct or -s, you are most likely to be dealing with cases of -ory. See for example: \n compulsory cursory derogatory \n illusory introductory mandatory \n obligatory perfunctory satisfactory \n valedictory \n The very many words with -ary have other combinations of letters before the suffix: \n complimentary dietary disciplinary \n elementary hereditary plenary \n revolutionary rotary rudimentary \n solitary \n *If the word is a noun, the ending could be -ary, -ery or -ory. Overall there are more ending in -ery than either of the other two, but you can be more certain of the spelling by being aware of how these words fall into certain semantic groups. For example: \n -ary These are typically either nouns referring to a person’s role: \n actuary dignitary legionary \n mercenary secretary \n Or else to something in which a collection of objects is to be found:  \n aviary breviary dictionary dispensary \n granary library rosary summary \n -ery These nouns may refer to general states or styles of behavior: \n  buffoonery drudgery flattery mystery \n savagery slavery snobbery trickery \n Or else to occupations, trades and the tools or goods associated with them: \n archery bakery brewery butchery \n confectionery drapery grocery hosiery \n joinery machinery millinery printery \n saddlery surgery tannery winery \n -ory Nouns ending this way typically refer to a place in terms of the characteristic activity that takes place there: \n conservatory depository dormitory \n  laboratory observatory repository \n ♦ For the difference between accessory/accessary, mandatory/mandatary and stationery/ stationary, see individual entries."

		"title": "as",
		"explanation":"This little conjunction provides many kinds of links in written English, including comparative, temporal and causative. It also serves as a relative pronoun, preposition and adverb. There are style and usage issues affecting all of these roles. \n  1 Comparative as. On its own, conjunctive as prefaces adverbial clauses: \n You can set up house there as you wish. \n They never join in as they used to. \n The use of as rather than like in the second kind of sentence has long been prescribed in British English, though without recognition of the finer points. (See further at like.) Doubled up, as forms a correlative with itself, as in: \n as loud as they could \n not as difficult as she expected \n When the comparison is negative, as in the last case, the word so can replace the first as: not so difficult as she expected. This alternation is established in some conventional positive expressions of this kind: \n  as far as / so far as I’m concerned \n as long as / so long as they play ball. \n 2 Temporal and causative as. These are not problematic in themselves, but sometimes hard to distinguish: \n As he walked through the church, the organ began playing. \n He began to whistle the tune as no-one else was there. \n Does as express cause or time in these cases? Time is more likely in the first and cause in the second, but either is possible. Such ambiguity does no harm in conversation; and poets or dramatists may indeed exploit it to allow more than one interpretation of the discourse. But in expository and argumentative prose, an ambiguous as may blur the structure of thinking. Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) showed that causative use of as was actually much rarer than temporal use across all spoken and written styles. American speakers and writers proved less inclined to make causative use of as than their British counterparts. \n 3 Relative as. This use of as ranges from the standard to the colloquial. In the following sentence it takes the place of the pronoun who: \n Childcare facilities are available to all such staff as have been employed for more than two years. \n Burchfield (1997) confirms that the construction of as with such or the same remains standard in British English, and Webster’s English Usage (1989) offers examples from contemporary American sources. Now mostly confined to American English is the contraction of as in all’s, as in \n All’s you have to do is press a couple of buttons. \n The contraction is rather informal and rarely seen in print (only two examples in CCAE). \n 4 Prepositional as. The comparative use of as (lonely as a cloud ), and projective use into a role or character (as parents they were learning all the time) is uncontroversial – except when followed by personal pronouns that distinguish subject and object (I/me, he/him etc.). In practice these constructions are rare in serious nonfiction, according to the Longman Grammar; and in fictional writing where they do freely appear, the subject and object pronouns are about equally used. In conversation the object pronouns hold sway. \n 5 Adverbial as. The uses of as as adverb are rather abstract, indicating restrictions on the time or scope of an action, for example as now, as yet. They are stylistically neutral, at home in various kinds of discourse. Compare: \n as of June 19 / as from June 19 \n as per your instructions \n These uses of as are commonly associated with contracts and business writing."

		"title": "Asian or Asiatic",
		"explanation":"These words are almost equally old, but they are not now equally usable. In the US as well as the UK, Asiatic is felt to be disparaging, probably because of its use as a racial designator, as in the San Francisco Asiatic Exclusion League of 1907 (previously the Japanese and Korean Exclusion League), and the anti-Asiatic riots in Vancouver (1906-7), against Hindus and Sikhs. American wartime nomenclature such as the Asiatic campaign and the Asiatic-Pacific theater of operations also carry hostile implications. Since the 1940s Asian has increasingly replaced Asiatic for all ordinary purposes: what were previously Asiatic countries/people/art/languages are now Asian countries/people/art/languages. In BNC data, Asian outnumbers Asiatic by almost 20:1 and in CCAE by more than 600:1. \n The continuing uses of Asiatic in both databases are academic, in analyses of ancient Greek and near-Eastern cultures, and of Marxist theory on the Asiatic mode of production. Clearly the geographical reference points differ in ancient history and in political philosopy. Other rather generalized uses of the word are to be found in zoological and botanical names such as the Asiatic clam / black bear / lily / bittersweet. \n The geographical reference points for Asian are just as diverse, and may involve any part or parts of that large continent. In British English Asian often connects with the Indian subcontinent in discussions on immigrants and immigration. In other contexts Asian can refer to Central Asia (the central Asian khanates, including Khiva, Bukhara and Kokand ); or to Southeast Asia including the offshore islands (S.E. Asian languages, including Korean, Japanese and Javanese). In the US and Australia, this is probably the most common application of the word. Australians sometimes debate whether they too are “part of Asia,” but the phrase raises questions of political and cultural identity rather than geography."

		"title": "aside (from) or apart (from)",
		"explanation":" Americans use both these adverbs/prepositions, but are more inclined to aside, in the ratio of 5:4 in data from CCAE. British inclination runs the other way, so that apart outnumbers aside in the BNC by about 5:2. So despite regional preferences, both words are current in the UK as well as the US. The differing frequencies do however help to explain why aside from, meaning “not taken into account,” is much less used in British English (the ratio is about 1:6 in BNC data); whereas aside from and apart from appear almost equally in American data from CCAE. Idioms such as these things aside and aside from everything else are also much less common in British English, where they are formulated with apart (Peters, 1998b)."

		"title": "aspect",
		"explanation":"This is part of the grammatical meaning of some verbs, interacting with the tense yet independent of it. It gives a perspective on the verb, indicating whether its action is complete or still going on. The difference is clear in: \n ear in: The official party had arrived. \n The official party was arriving. Both verb phrases are in the past tense, but while the first is perfect in its aspect (i.e. the action is complete), the second is imperfect (also called progressive, continuous or durative) in its aspect (i.e. the action is still going on). In some languages this difference is shown entirely by the endings of the main verb, but English does it with a combination of the particular auxiliary verb and participle. The auxiliary have plus the past participle forms the perfect aspect; and a part of the verb be plus the present participle forms the imperfect. (See further under auxiliary verbs and participles.) \n 1 Use of the imperfect (-ing) aspect with stative verbs. Standard English resists using the imperfect aspect with stative verbs, or rather, verbs used to represent timeless states or open facts. Instead they are expressed with the simple present: \n Two and two make four. \n Finland has many lakes. \n Steve is overweight. \n Everyone enjoys a party. \n They spend little time watching television. \n Verbs expressing mental and emotional states also resist the imperfect. For most contexts, it could not be used to paraphrase: \n I love detective stories. \n She believes everything he says. \n They spend little time on the garden. \n We all hope for a better future. \n When imperfect forms are used with such verbs, they seem to point at the recency or temporariness of the state: \n They are (now) spending little time on the garden. \n We are all hoping for a better future (in these difficult times). \n In some regional varieties of English, notably Indian English, the imperfect is nevertheless used generally with stative contructions, e.g. I am loving detective stories, without implying any restrictions on the state of mind. Compare: I’m loving detective stories since you introduced me to Marele Day, which could just be said by English-speakers anywhere. It is however unlikely to be seen in standard prose. \n 2 Regional variation in use of the imperfect and perfect aspects. American speakers use the imperfect (-ing) aspect more often than their British counterparts: the ratio is 4:3 in conversational data from the Longman Grammar corpus. By contrast, British writers are more given to using the perfect (-ed) aspect than American writers, again by a factor of 4:3 in the Longman Grammar research. The differential is at its most marked in news reporting, but it impacts on other registers as well. One consequence is that adverbs such as already and just, which are sometimes said to require the present perfect, can combine with the simple past in American English. Compare: \n We already gave him a response (American) \n We have already given him a response (British) \n The British tendency to make more use of the English present perfect is analogous to that of the French with the passe compos ´ e´ (Engel and Ritz, 2000), which has largely displaced the simple past for everyday purposes."

		"title": "assist",
		"explanation":"This verb can be complemented in a variety of ways. It can take a simple object, as in assist the war effort. But assist is more often construed with a particle of some kind: \n ∗ with in: \n to assist the user in meditation \n assist in the development of American football \n can assist in removing the confusions \n assist Namco in creating the next generation of arcade games \n ∗ with with: \n to assist an elderly person with the completion of their tax return \n can assist with obtaining an overview \n Both constructions can take abstract nouns and/or -ing forms as complements, but the -ing type are far more frequent after in, in data from the BNC. This correlates with the fact that the assist in construction is much more common than the assist with construction, in both British and American databases. \n An alternative construction with assist is to + infinitive, as in: \n assist you to negotiate a contract \n assist families to overcome problems \n The construction with to plus infinitive requires an object, whereas the other two do not. The three types of complementation are largely interchangeable in terms of semantics, though the first is rather more formal in style."

		"title": "assume or presume",
		"explanation":"A good deal of ink has been spilled over the difference between these words, about their relative strength in expressing the idea of “take for granted,” and whether facts or beliefs are involved. One of the most important differences is the simple fact that assume is much more common than presume, in both British and American English. In both Brown and LOB databases, instances of assume (including assumed/assumes/assuming) outnumber those of presume by more than 12:1. Assume slips easily into everyday discussion, drawing less attention to itself and more to the particular point which the speaker wants to foreground. Presume seems to draw attention to itself and to the presumptive act on the part of the speaker. \n ♦ On assuming that, see dangling participles."

The answer used to be “When it’s life assurance.” The Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) noted this, but also that the distinction was not made originally (there were cases of marine assurance), and that it did not prevail everywhere (life insurance was also to be found). Life insurance is now much more frequent than life assurance, at least by the evidence of the internet. The ratio between them was about 5:2 in a Google search (2002). However among the most prominent businesses registered under each name, life assurance tended to come from non-English countries (Germany, Egypt, Thailand, Philippines) and from Canada, whereas life insurance companies were often sited in the US or England."

		"title": "asterisk",
		"explanation":"The asterisk sign * has no standard role in punctuation, but is put to a variety of purposes by writers, text editors and printers; and by specialists in particular fields. \n *General uses of the asterisk \n 1 as a mark of omission or ellipsis \n 2 as a typographical dividing line, to make a break in a narrative (a set of asterisks spaced across the whole page) \n 3 to refer readers to footnotes \n 4 to enumerate the items in a list (see lists section 2) \n The first of these uses is vigorously discouraged by both the Chicago Manual (1993) and Hart’s Rules (1983), and clearly it’s unnecessary when we have the apostrophe to mark an omitted letter, and three dots for the ellipsis of whole words. The question remains of what to do when quoting four-letter words without wanting (or being permitted) to spell them out. To use asterisks for the missing letters, as in “F*** you,” seems to draw attention to the word, which may of course be what the writer intends. The set of asterisks embellishes the places of the missing letters so as to positively invite the reader to fill them in. A complete row of asterisks across the page marks a more substantial break than extra line space, and often signals a discontinuity in the focus of the text. \n The third use, as a footnoting device, is the most commonly encountered of all uses of the asterisk. One or more asterisks helps to lead readers to the occasional footnote at the bottom of a page, especially in texts which also make use of numbered endnotes. They thus provide an auxiliary referencing system for the author, or for editors who wish to add special-purpose footnotes. In tables of numbers the asterisk can draw the reader’s attention to footnotes, and substitute for superscript numbers which might be confused with the numbers of the table itself. However square-bracketed numbers, not asterisks, are often used these days within tables of numbers. \n *Specialized uses of the asterisk \n –in statistics, asterisks mark the three levels of probability conventionally used in analyzing numerical findings. Three asterisks correspond to a probability of less than .001 that the phenomenon occurred by chance; two asterisks to a probability of less than .01; and a single asterisk to less than .05. \n –in computing, the asterisk indicates an unknown character or characters, used as a wildcard for more comprehensive effect (a search for affect* would find instances of affected/affecting/affects as well as affect) \n –in historical linguistics, asterisks mark conjectural, reconstructed forms of words: Indo-European *treies becomes “three” in English. Linguistic theorists also use the asterisk for constructions that are grammatically unacceptable, such as *The sky is shattering."

		"title": "astro-",

Some of these words, like astronomy and astrology, come direct from Greek. Others like astrobiology, astronaut, astrophysics, astrosphere are recent formations. The astrolabe was a medieval navigating instrument. Its C20 counterpart is the astrocompass. All these words have retained their scientific roles apart from astronomic(al), which doubles as a colloquial word for “skyhigh.” Like other paired adjectives of this kind, astronomic and astronomical differ little in meaning (see -ic/-ical). \n Also related to astro- are asterisk and aster (the flower), where the emphasis is on the visual shape of stars rather than their uses. Both were borrowed into English via Latin."

		"title": "asyndeton",
		"explanation":"This Greek loanword refers to the lack of a coordinating word between items in a series. In a series of three or more, asyndeton is the norm for all but the last pair. See for example: \n on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday \n . . . wouldn’t eat bread, pasta, porridge or potatoes \n For writers, the asyndeton has the rhetorical effect of piling one example on top of another (see further under rhythm section 2). This rhetorical effect can be extended by not using a coordinator such as and and or between the last pair of words: \n . . . put a stop to all such jokes, jibes, snide remarks \n  Pure asyndeton like this is less common than polysyndeton (i.e. mixed forms of linkage, explicit and nonexplicit), shown in the first pair of examples. Polysyndeton helps the reader to anticipate the end of a series, especially when there is no change of typeface to mark it. But when a different typeface is used for the series of examples, the coordinator is superfluous and may seem fussy, insisting on talking the reader through what is obvious from other cues. This is why pure asyndeton is often used in the sets of examples presented in this book. \n ♦ For the use of commas between items in a series, see comma section 3b."

But in this role, at is clearly not a preposition but an adverb, complementing the subject of the clause. (See further under predicate section 1.) No doubt the contemporary flavor of the idiom also draws comment, and the fact that it smacks of spoken rather than written English. \n The collocation at about raises eyebrows in some quarters as an oxymoron.

		"title": "-ate",
		"explanation":"A slightly loaded question: how would you pronounce the following? \n animate articulate designate duplicate \n graduate moderate separate syndicate \n All these words, and some others ending in -ate, are pronounced in two ways. The pronunciation depends on the words’ grammatical role – whether they serve as adjectives, verbs or nouns. \n  Adjectives ending in -ate are pronounced with just one main stress which is early in the word, either on the first syllable (as in animate), or the second (as in articulate). They often have a past passive meaning: designate (as in governor designate) means “having been appointed,” and separate “having been divided off.” (In Latin they were all past participles of first conjugation verbs.) These adjectives often provided the stem for the development of verbs in English, and from those verbs we have a fresh crop of participial adjectives alongside the older ones. See for example: \n animate/animated \n designate/designated \n separate/separated \n The meaning of the later ones is of course more closely related to the verb. A few -ate adjectives have no verb counterparts however: \n affectionate considerate \n dispassionate proportionate \n 2 Verbs ending in -ate are the most common words of this kind. They are pronounced with two stresses, one early and one on the final syllable, so that it rhymes with “mate.” Many such verbs date from C15, as do all of the following: \n abbreviate consecrate contaminate dedicate \n  equate frustrate incorporate inoculate \n mitigate recreate terminate translate \n Alongside verbs like those with Latin stems, -ate has long been the formative in words with French or English stems: \n assassinate hyphenate marinate orchestrate \n All those originated in C16. Since then -ate has remained a highly productive verb suffix, attaching itself to stems from any language. Occasionally there are duplicate verb forms in -ate such as commentate (alongside comment) and orientate (alongside orient). To some, such -ate forms seem redundant, though they may develop their own specialized meanings. (See further under comment and orient.) \n 3 Nouns ending in -ate are few in number, and have a single early stress like the adjectives. There are two distinct kinds, one official and the other scientific. The older ones are official words referring either to an office or institution: \n consulate directorate electorate syndicate \n or to the incumbent of a particular office or status: \n curate graduate magistrate \n Many were borrowed from Latin, though some have been formed in English on non-Latin bases, e.g. caliphate, shogunate. The scientific words ending in -ate refer to chemical compounds which are salts of acids ending in -ic, including: \n acetate lactate nitrate \n  permanganate phosphate sulfate \n Compare the scientist’s use of the suffix -ite."

		"title": "-athon",
		"explanation":"This freshly evolved suffix refers to an endurance test of some kind, taking its cue from the word marathon, the Olympic contest in long-distance running. That word was actually a placename, the site of the Greek victory over the Persian army in 490 BC. Yet its latter syllables have helped to generate many a suburban contest based on sticking at one particular activity: the dance-a-thon and the bowlathon, as well as the rockathon (for continuous rocking in the rocking chair) registered in the Guinness Book of Records. Many -athons are designed to raise money for a good cause, e.g. the bike-athon for cerebral palsy, though this becomes rather blatant in the begathon held by an American radio station to raise money. Most -athon words are created for the event and disappear with it. Walkathon and talkathon however are both established – listed in Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and on record since the 1930s. Talkathon in the US is still associated with political endeavors, as a synonym for “filibuster” as well as the term for the extended talkback radio/TV done by a campaigning politician. But in Britain it’s the length rather than any cause which makes it a talkathon. The Oxford citations show it being used of a very lengthy BBC discussion, and a protracted conversation between intimates. \n Not surprisingly, English creations ending in -athon are pluralized with -s, rather than Greek plurals.

Almost all the verbs in the entry on -ate above have nouns ending in -ation.

For example: \n There was animation in their faces at the prospect of refreshments. \n The prospect of refreshments animated their faces. \n The prospect of refreshments animated their faces. Verbs in -ate provide a ready cure for writing which is heavy with -ation words. They require some rewording of the sentence, but that’s part of the cure. \n A small group of nouns ending in -ation are related to verbs ending in -ify, not -ate. For example: \n beautification (beautify) gratification (gratify) \n identification (identify) justification (justify) \n  simplification (simplify) \n In these cases the verb has been borrowed through French, whereas the noun goes back to Late Latin."

An additional issue with sound recordings is the need to recognize the role of both the originator/composer of the work and the performer; or for interviews, both the subject (interviewee) and interviewer (the person with substantial responsibility). In citing all such kinds of material, the medium needs to be identified, in square brackets immediately after the title. \n 1 Films, movies, videotapes, television programs. Most films, movies, video recordings and TV productions are the product of collaboration, and so the title rather than any individual author is featured first: \n Crocodile Dundee [motion picture] Directed by Peter Faiman. California. Rimfire Films. 1986. \n Distributed by CBS FOX. \n  The Story of English [video recording] Directed by Robert McCrum, William Cran and Robert MacNeill. London. BBC Enterprises. 1986. \n After identifying the title and medium, the reference may mention the person with either artistic or administrative responsibility (the director and/or producer). If the item is not in the hands of a commercial distributor, the repository in which it’s held is indicated. \n 2 Recordings of music and the spoken word, including interviews. Recordings of music usually feature the work of a composer or author, as well as that of a performer.

Margaret Throsby in conversation with David Suzuki and Edward Goldsmith [sound recording] Perth WA (1989) ABC Radio Tapes. \n For sound recordings made from a general broadcast, titles may have to be supplied, as in that last example. Note also that it helps to indicate to the reader what kind of format the sound is recorded on: audiocassette, compact disc etc. \n 3 Electronic media: computer programs, CD-ROMs, on-line documents. The first two media are analogous to published books in terms of the bibliographic information needed. The third has more in common with unique objects stored at a particular location (see below, section 5). \n a) Computer programs. These are usually referenced first by title, although if there is a known author, his/her name is given first. A typical example is as follows: \n Grammatik [computer software] San Francisco, California. \n Reference Software International. (1991). \n b) CD-ROMs. Reference to any particular unit on the CD-ROM requires the reader to work through a main menu to the relevant submenu. The access path is indicated with one or more dashes. \n The ICAME Collection of English Language Corpora [CD-ROM] Bergen, Norway; Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities, 1993. \n Helsinki Corpus – Early Modern English texts. \n c) On-line documents: internet and WorldWideWeb materials. Because the message is separable from the medium, both need to be included in the reference. The identifying details of the document are given first, including the primary author, title of composition and title of host document, if different. Because electronic documents can be regularly updated, both the date of publication and the date of citation need to be supplied. The second is usually given in terms of the month and day (arguably, the particular hour of the day might be important, but it’s not regularly shown).

Because these items are unique, the repository in which they are kept is a vital element. For works of art, the reference highlights the creator and its title: \n Senbergs, Jan The Constitution and the States [wall panels] (1980) High Court of Australia, Canberra. \n For archival objects and museum realia, a descriptive title must be found as the focus of the reference: \n Black-glazed bowl [realia] fourth century BC.

In the UK, the ratio between auntie and aunty is rather closer: 5:2 in data from the BNC. \n The -ie spelling puts auntie among the colloquialisms for familiar persons and phenomena such as cabbie, chappie and sweetie (see further under -ie/-y). The -y spelling also serves in a variety of colloquialisms: hippy, baddy, druggy, as well as informal kinship terms such as daddy, granny and mummy/mommy. We may assume that aunty associates the word with the latter group. \n The use of Auntie in reference to the BBC dates from 1962, the implications being rather equivocal and not-so-affectionate. In Australia the analogous ABC was likewise dubbed Aunty, in a context of strong competition from its commercial rivals. It did generate affirmative action both in-house and in the community, with one Melbourne support group styling themselves Aunty’s nephews and nieces."

		"title": "Australia and Australians, Aussies and Oz",
		"explanation":"During C17 and C18, Australia was known as “New Holland,” a reminder of the fact that the Dutch were the first Europeans to locate and visit the land. The name Australia, derived from the Latin terra Australis (“Southern Land”), was used by Cook, but owes its establishment to Governor Macquarie in early C19. Australian was first applied to Aboriginal people in 1814 by Matthew Flinders, but within ten years it also referred to others living on the continent. The word is used in the original sense by linguists speaking of the Australian languages. \n The clipped form Aussie originated in World War I as a term for “Australia,” “an Australian,” and as the general-purpose adjective. The spellings Ossie and Ozzie showed up very infrequently in the same period, according to the Australian National Dictionary (1990). But the use of Oz took off in the 1970s, helped no doubt by publicity surrounding the radical Oz Magazine (1967–73)."

		"title": "Australian English",
		"explanation":"With the arrival of the First Fleet, Australian English began among settlers and convicts drawn mostly from southern and eastern England. Within a generation, the differentness of Australian speech was being commented on, for better or for worse. Yet only in C20 (and after two world wars) did Australian English attain its majority, and secure recognition of its place in the English-speaking world. \n Distinctively Australian vocabulary developed in response to the new social and physical environment. The conditions of transportation, the development of new pastoral lands and the gold rushes all demanded their own terminology. Some of it came from standard English (e.g. block, bush, squatter, emancipist), and some (e.g. barrack, billy, fossick) from English dialects. Convict slang drawn from the British underworld provided other words such as swag. \n New vocabulary was required for Australian flora and fauna, and the naming process went on throughout C19. The names for Australian fauna were sometimes borrowed from Aboriginal languages, and sometimes compounded out of English elements, and the same animal or bird might be referred to either way. So the dingo was also the native dog, the kookaburra was the laughing jackass or settler’s clock, and the koala the native bear. By the end of C19, this variation had mostly been ironed out, leaving fewer rather than more Aboriginal names. Few people remember that bettong was the name for a small kangaroo, tuan for a flying squirrel, and wobbegong for the carpet shark. The names for Australian flora and fauna were the staple of a dictionary titled Austral English, published in 1898 by E. E. Morris. Items from Morris’s list of Australianisms were incorporated into the Oxford and Webster’s dictionaries in the first half of C20. \n A wide-ranging account of the informal and colloquial aspects of Australian English was first made by S. J. Baker in a volume first published in 1945, titled The Australian Language, echoing H. L. Mencken’s The American Language (1919). Baker recorded the slang of many Australian subcultures: the racetrack, the pub, the two-up game, and above all that of Australia’s military forces in two world wars. Not all the words that he discussed were strictly speaking Australianisms, but they were and are part of the resources of Australian English. Like Mencken, he presented his findings in a series of essays with word lists embedded in them, not as a dictionary. \n The first comprehensive dictionary of Australian English, the Macquarie Dictionary, appeared in 1981 with 80,000 headwords. It included all standard Australian words and meanings, as well as Australianisms (expressions which originated in Australia and are often still unique to that country): words for new cultural and social phenomena, for the local flora and fauna as well as slang and colloquialisms. The Australian National Dictionary, published in 1990, concentrates on Australianisms alone, a total of 10,000 headwords, with substantial historical information on each via citations. \n Australian English does not seem to have diverged in its grammar from that of standard English elsewhere. In casual conversation some Australian-speakers (like English-speakers elsewhere) make nonstandard selections of tense, such as come for came, done for did, and kep for kept; and but can occur as a sentence-final item (see but). However, none of this appears in print, except when an author quotes or aims to represent nonstandard speech. The morphology of Australian English words is based on the same resources as English everywhere, although Australians make fuller use than others of informal shortenings of words with −o (as in milko for “milkman”), and with -ie (as in barbie for “barbecue”). The latter suffix is sometimes said to be childish, but in Australia its use is widespread among adults, and words formed with it are part of the informal style of popular daily newspapers. \n The only distinctively Australian detail of morphology one might point to is in the handful of reduplicative words (e.g. mia-mia, willy-willy), which embody the exact reduplication used in various Aboriginal languages. In English generally the echoic type of reduplication (ping-pong, walkie-talkie) is much more common, and words with exact reduplication remain informal (see further under reduplicatives). \n The details of Australian written style (i.e. editorial style) are not strongly standardized, in that most publishing houses and newspapers print their own style guides for their writers and editors. The Australian government Style Manual, now in its sixth edition (2002), sets the standard for federal government publications, and is referred to by other Australian institutions and corporations. \n Beyond the genres of official publishing, different editorial practices may seem appropriate, and with both British and American publishing houses at work in Australia, the range of styles is probably increasing rather than decreasing. The institution of regular “Style Council” conferences since 1986 has helped to inform editors about variable and changing trends in style. (Contact the Linguistics Department, Macquarie University, for information about them.) There is no language academy to refer to in Australia (any more than in Britain or the US), but the Style Council conferences provide a consultative forum for discussing and assessing the options in written Australian English. \n ♦ See further under language academy."

		"title": "author and authoress",
		"explanation":"Sensitivity to unnecessary gender specification has curbed the use of authoress, and its numbers in British and American databases are minuscule. In data from the BNC the frequency of authoress is about 1% of that of author – and less than that in CCAE. Female writers are regularly referred to as author, and it is only the odd occasion which generates such citations as authoress and artist Miss Fleur Cowles and her husband . . . (in which case the commentator is clearly going out of ?his? way to mark the writer’s gender). \n The verb author has recently returned to common usage after centuries of disuse. Before becoming “obsolete” in C17, it evidently supported both the meanings current now: (i) be the author of, and (ii) create or originate (something). The first meaning is the commoner for authored in BNC citations, while authoring is mostly associated with computer authoring tools, a new application of the second meaning. In CCAE authoring supports both meanings. Writers’ reputations are evidently based on such things as “authoring a poetry book” or “authoring five cookbooks,” while another’s distinction was to be “winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace prize for authoring the peace plan.” Other American examples apply the word to someone who is the architect and prime mover of legislation, but there are no parallels in data from the BNC. Both American and British English make use of the verb co-author (“be joint author of ”)."

In authoritarian there is resentment of high-handed leadership, whereas in authoritative the leadership provided is welcome and respected.

		"title": "auto- and auto",
		"explanation":"Borrowed from Greek, the prefix auto meaning “self ” or “on its own” is familiar enough in words like: \n autobiography autocracy autocrat \n  autograph autoimmune automatic \n automaton automobile autonomous \n autonomic autonomy \n A less obvious example is autopsy, which is literally “inspection with one’s own eyes.” Its reference nowadays is so restricted to postmortems that one would hardly venture a joke about an “autopsy” of the food served in the company canteen, though in past centuries (up to C18), the word was not so specialized in its meaning. \n From its use in automobile, the prefix auto- can also mean “associated with motor cars,” as in auto-electrician, auto-mechanic. In American English these would appear spaced rather than hyphened, in keeping with the fact that auto has a life of its own as an abbreviation of automobile. \n In the phrase auto-da-fe, borrowed from Portuguese, auto means “act” (of faith). It was a euphemism for the execution of those tried by the Inquisition, and usually applied to the burning of “heretics.”"

		"title": "auxiliary verbs",
		"explanation":"These verbs combine with others to make up a verb phrase, and help to indicate tense, aspect, voice,mood and modality. (See under those headings for more about each.) Auxiliaries complement the main verb (also known as the full verb or lexical verb), bringing grammatical meaning to bear on its lexical meaning. The verb phrase may contain as many as three auxiliaries (or even four), as the following set shows: \n was added \n was being added \n had been added \n might have been added \n might have been being added (at that time) \n A verb which has no accompanying auxiliary is known as a simple verb (compare compound verbs). The auxiliaries are often classed into two subgroups: primary auxiliaries and modal auxiliaries, which form closed sets. There is also an expanding set of semi-auxiliaries/semi-modals. \n 1 The primary auxiliaries are have, be and do. Have and be have the special characteristic of combining with participles, present and past, in order to express aspect, and the passive voice (see further under those headings). Have and be never combine with the “bare” infinitive, as do the modal auxiliaries and the verb do itself. In the continuous flow of discourse, the auxiliaries have and be sometimes appear unaccompanied by participles, but this is when the relevant participle can be inferred from a previous sentence. So for example it is natural enough to say (or write): \n I haven’t met the new assistant yet. Have you? \n The main verb participle met (and its object) are understood through the use of have in the question. \n Primary auxiliaries can also stand alone as main/full/lexical verbs, as in: \n He has a large office. \n They are in the bottom drawer. \n In those cases, each verb carries its own lexical meaning: have a possessive meaning, and be an existential meaning. \n The auxiliary do has special roles in helping to formulate the interrogative (Do I like spaghetti? ) and negative statements (I don’t like spaghetti ). All interrogative and negative statements are phrased with do, unless they already contain one of the other auxiliaries (primary or modal ). Do has other roles as a substitute verb: \n I enjoy spaghetti much more than they do. Here do stands for the main (lexical) verb enjoy and its object in the second clause. Once again, do performs this function unless there is another auxiliary present. Compare the following with the previous example: \n They wouldn’t enjoy the spaghetti as I would. \n They can’t enjoy the spaghetti as I can.  \n When do works as a main verb in its own right, it means “work on (something),” as in doing one’s accounts or doing the milk run. \n 2 The modal auxiliaries express shades of possibility, certainty and obligation, with a “bare” infinitive following. Two of them, will and shall, can also express future time, although there may be an overtone of certainty or obligation there as well: \n You will be in my power! \n The vote shall be taken as soon as the motion is put. \n The key modal auxiliaries are: \n can could may \n might must shall \n should will would \n These are the grammarians’ “central modals,” contrasting with those in the next section. (See further under modality and modal verbs.) \n  ♦ For the use of paired modals (e.g., might could), see double modal. \n 3 Semi-auxiliaries, semi-modals, periphrastic modals. English makes use of a number of quasimodal verbs, whose meaning resembles that of one or other of the verbs in section 2, and seems to paraphrase it: \n i) \n dare (to) (compare could) \n need (to) (compare must) \n ought to (compare should) \n used to (compare would) \n be able to (compare can) \n be about to (compare will) \n be going to (compare will) \n be likely to (compare will) \n be obliged to (compare must) \n be supposed to (compare should) \n be willing to (compare would) \n have to (compare must) \n Quasimodals behave somewhat like modals, in not requiring do-support in negative constructions. But those in the second set are always followed by the to-infinitive, and it’s usually so for those in the first (see further under dare (to), need, used to, ought). The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) calls the first set “marginal modals” and the second “semi-auxiliaries” (since all involve the use of primary auxiliaries). Alternative names used in the Longman Grammar (1999) are “marginal auxiliaries” for the first set, and “semi-modals” for the second, though semi-modal is also used to cover both groups (excluding dare). To avoid the dual use of semi-modal and prevent misunderstanding, the cover term quasimodal is used in this book for both types of periphrastic modal. \n ♦ Compare catenatives."

		"title": "avail",
		"explanation":"As a noun, avail is now mostly fixed into the negative idiom to no avail, and its occasional variants to little avail, to any avail and the rhetorical question To what avail? \n The verb avail still has plenty of vitality as a reflexive form, as in anxious to avail themselves of the instruction afforded to their children. This is standard in both American and British English, but a sprinkling of other constructions, both transitive and intransitive, appear in the databases, some of which suggest a nostalgia for older usage. Transitive uses such as it will not avail him as a defence (BNC), one whose mercies might avail him better (CCAE), and intransitive ones like God does avail much sound just idiomatic, and American writers seem able to vary the intransitive construction: \n Driving under military escort will not avail. \n No kind of summitry will avail unless the Soviet Union continues . . . \n As in these examples, negative predications can be formulated with avail. Those embodying a positive statement seem more marginal: enables budget travelers to avail of low-cost flights (CCAE); [computer] design to avail of advanced telecommunication infrastructures (BNC). Here avail means “take advantage”; elsewhere it means “provide”: the bill would avail health insurance to the uninsured in Iowa; the forum would avail him the opportunity to get just that (both CCAE). These perhaps experimental constructions seem to connect with the ubiquitous adjective available, though the derivational process is ad hoc. They are mutants in the evolution of language, but for the moment rather marginal."

It is particularly prevalent in sports writing, in both the US and the UK. The following are tokens of the many examples in both the BNC and CCAE: \n She has also gained an awesome reputation in racing. \n It is not an awesome lineup. But it is local. \n In both databases awesome also injects hyperbole into advertorials on consumer products: an awesome driver’s car; the speed [of the computer’s operation] is awesome.

The Oxford Dictionary (1989) stands by the etymology of the phrase and finds only for a while acceptable. Its position is not entirely borne out by data from the BNC, in which for awhile makes up about 15% of the 89 instances of awhile. The Oxford does however hint at the “unification of sense” which may be there in awhile, and in idioms and collocations such as not yet awhile, stay awhile, stood awhile in thought, any strict notion of time seems to be being played down. Separating awhile into a while may seem to make too much of what is – after all – a vague time period."

		"title": "axe or ax",

Yet its citations show that the spelling axe gained support in Britain during C19, and the second edition of the Dictionary (1989) confirms that ax is no longer in use, as does the BNC. \n The best argument for the spelling axe is that it contrives to make the word consist of three letters. It thus conforms to the principle that while function words may have less than three letters, content words usually have a minimum of three (see further under words). The extra e is of course dropped when it becomes a verb axing and axed, at which point its redundancy is obvious. (See further under -e section 1.)"

In the British parliament aye becomes a noun meaning “one who votes in the affirmative,” as in: The ayes have it. In the US Congress the affirmative votes are the “yeas.” \n The shorter spelling ay is occasionally used for the parliamentary vote. But it then overlaps with the adverb, apart from challenging the principle that English content words generally have a minimum of three letters (see under words). All this makes aye much the better spelling for the affirmative word."

		"title": "-b/-bb",
		"explanation":"Words ending in the letter -b often become -bb before adding a suffix beginning with a vowel sound. The doubling happens whenever the suffix begins with e, i or y; and with -le and -ly, which both involve the indeterminate vowel (see schwa). For example: \n ad-libbed bobble clubbed cobwebby \n  crabby dubbing glibbest hobnobbed \n knobbly robber rubbed snobbish \n  snubbed stabbing \n These spellings show the consonant-doubling used in English words of one syllable – or two, the second of which has an independent life as a monosyllable. (See further under doubling of final consonant.) Note that the vowel in all of them is short. When it’s long or a diphthong, the b stays single, as in booby and bribed. \n The doubling principle applies also in abbreviated words with short vowels such as confabbed and women’s libber. For them, the double b is a sign of being anglicized (from latinate originals: confabulation and liberation respectively)."

		"title": "baby and babe",
		"explanation":"Both American and British English use baby as the ordinary, unmarked term for an infant, and to describe the offspring or offshoots of other animals and plants, as in baby rabbits, baby carrots. Brand and product names use baby to indicate the small of the species, e.g. babybel (for the smallest wax-packaged cheeses), and baby grand (for the miniature grand piano). With all these applications, baby is much more common than babe, the difference being about 15:1 in the US and 45:1 in the UK, by database evidence. \n In standard English, a babe is not usually an ordinary baby. Its use in the King James bible connects it with the Nativity, as in the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes. Idioms like newborn babe, babe-in-arms and sleeping like a babe are more often figurative than references to infants. Otherwise, babe in this sense survives mostly as an intimate word for the family or the neighborhood, as when the local newspaper hopes that both mum and babe will be problem-free. Meanwhile in British advertising, the babe is beginning to grow up, to become the Bovril Babe. An advertorial on the latest swimming fashions foreshadows what the nifty water babe will be wearing next year – playing on the title of Kingsley’s Water Babies. Other BNC citations suggest the “American” use of babe as a casual term of endearment is catching on, at least in British novels: Do you want a hand, babe? \n In American English, babe has long been both a term of endearment and a way of referring to female companions and sex symbols. In some examples from CCAE, babe has divine allure, as in babe of paradise; in others it has commodity value: a bankable star and a bit more of a babe. Yet the idiom political babe in the woods makes babe naive and gender-neutral. On the baseball scene, babe can be used man to man: \n “You’re out of here, babe,” Perlozzo told his first baseman. \n Such usage is probably helped by the memory of Babe Ruth, whose legendary status allows his name to be used in surprising places, as in the Babe Ruth of conflict resolution. Baseball apart, babe can now be heard in casual reference to an attractive adult – and as a term of endearment – anywhere in the English-speaking world."

		"title": "back of, in back of and in back",
		"explanation":"American English does without the in all these constructions, and so they may sound elliptical and alien to British ears. Yet back of is more than four centuries old, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and known everywhere in the English-speaking world in the phrase back of beyond. Productive use of back of can be found in British fiction (Burchfield, 1996). In the US, Canada and Australia, it gets a lowish level of use in expressions like back of the range and back of the supermarket, drawing attention to what is in the hinterland or behind/beyond the immediately visible. It makes a useful paraphrase as in the following example from CCAE: \n Behind it is ... Cannery Row Memorial Park . . . , and back of that, the site of the “Palace Flophouse.” \n Back of can also be used figuratively, as in: \n The party made gains but stayed well back of the Democrats in House seats. \n This parallels its quite frequent use in sports reporting: on the golfer, one stroke back of the leader, or the horse closing strongly, a half-length back of Mykawa. \n In back of is sometimes used in sports reports too, as of the athlete surprised at being 2.14 seconds in back of the winner. It can be used more abstractly, as in: \n One could even respond to a . . . voice in back of the speaker’s question . . . \n Most often in back of explains physical locations, as in: \n Buildings in back of the charred commercial structure were also damaged. \n Subway tracks ran in back of all the houses on her side of the street. \n As these examples from CCAE show, in back of usually means “beyond the back of ” (and outside it), so that it contrasts with in the back of, which locates something inside. In fact American use of in back of complements the common English use of in front of. It is relatively recent, however, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), and potentially ambiguous outside the US. Curiously the use of in back of may be a response to ill-founded criticism of back of – not on grounds of ambiguity, but because it was thought colloquial. Webster’s English Usage affirms the place of both expressions in standard American English. \n The phrase in back is also an Americanism, often used of getting into or being in the rear seat of a vehicle. So the US headline: \n THIEF TAKES VAN WITH CHILD ASLEEP IN BACK. \n corresponds exactly to the British: \n THIEVES DRIVE OFF MOTHER’S CAR WITH BABY IN BACK SEAT. \n  In British English, this headline would be paraphrased as “in the back seat” in the article itself, but not in American. Other CCAE citations from newsreports show that in back is the common phrase: as when the driver assumed that the passenger in back was Patrick; or when Wilson stays at the wheel; Elzie sits in back assembling the packages – the traveling cottage industry. In back is used to indicate other spatial relations, as in: women swinging their way down darkened streets with footsteps in back following them; and the hall open to concertgoers sitting on the lawn in back. In British English the phrase would be “behind” or “at the back” respectively. \n The three phrases of this entry all point to the fact that back retains more of its adverbial character in American idiom than in British."

Just occasionally words (especially verbs) are formed in the opposite way, distilled out of pre-existing words which are construed as complex ones (see further under complex words). So burgle is from burglar, accrete from accretion, and electrocute from electrocution. Some other verbs derived in this way are: \n donate edit enthuse extradite \n laze liaise reminisce resurrect \n scavenge sidle swindle televize \n Compound words also lend themselves to backformation, witness the following verbs: \n baby-sit day-dream dry-clean lip-read \n  self-destruct spring-clean window-shop \n Most of the backformations just mentioned have become standard English, but many others are transient. More than half of those appearing in American and British glossaries of new words are not taken up in dictionaries, according to Ayto’s (1998) research. \n To some writers backformations of any kind are unacceptable, as if their unusual origin makes them illegitimate words. Some backformations seem rather superfluous, because they duplicate an existing verb. Thus orientate, backformed from orientation, means much the same as orient, and is cross-referenced to it in many dictionaries – though there are regional differences in their distribution (see further under orient and orientate). Other backformations like commentate (from commentator) are certainly earning their keep alongside the existing verb (comment), and cover different areas of meaning (see further under comment). It seems pedantic to deny their legitimacy on account of their origins. Their newness often attracts attention though even that is relative to people’s exposure to them. Some examples like remediate (1969) and surveil (1960) are older than they feel; revulse (as in I was revulsed by it) has been registered in American dictionaries since the 1930s, though not yet in Britain (in this passive sense). The motive for backforming revulse from revulsion is clear enough: the formally related verbs such as revolt and repel seem too remote. \n Note that the singular Aborigine was at one stage censured as a backformation from the plural aborigines, which was the only form used in Latin (see further under Aboriginal).

In fact, the adjective back-to-back has long been used in the UK (since 1845) to refer to a kind of high-density suburban architecture: back-to-back houses (or just back-to-backs), associated with old industrial towns. This particular spatial sense appears not to have crossed the Atlantic, though Americans certainly use back-to-back in reference to simple physical arrangements such as back-to-back seats in a railway car. Spatial uses of back-to-back are more or less transparent, but its temporal uses are also well established worldwide, recognized in Canadian and Australian dictionaries (Canadian Oxford, 1998, and the Macquarie Dictionary, 1997), as well as British and American."

		"title": "bacteria and bacterium",
		"explanation":"To classicists and scientists, bacteria is unequivocally plural, and so These bacteria are dangerous is the only way to construe the word. The answer is less clear cut for others, especially in the US. Extensive data from nontechnical sources in CCAE show that the word is quite often construed as a collective or singular noun, as indicated by singular verb agreement: \n Make sure that all the bacteria was taken care of A bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes was found in icecream. \n Singular examples like these and plural ones occur in the ratio of about 2:5 in the database. Singular agreement often shows up when a particular strain of bacteria is being identified for the public, as in the second example. British sources contained in the BNC also provide evidence of bacteria in singular constructions: \n Normal skin bacteria breaks down into irritating free-fatty acids. \n When a bacteria or a virus gets into us . . . \n Such examples are from nonscientific communication, but they confirm the use of bacteria as a collective or singular noun, which needs to be recognized in dictionaries. \n Bacteria is of course a Latin plural (see -a), whose singular is the rather rare bacterium. The ratio between them is 10:1 in British data from the BNC, and about 12:1 in American English from CCAE. The rarity of bacterium helps to explain why bacteria itself is increasingly used as a singular, at least in nonscientific writing."

		"title": "bad or badly",
		"explanation":"No-one could dispute the fact that bad is first and foremost an adjective (a bad shot), and badly an adverb (He played badly). This division of labor was stressed by C18 and C19 grammarians, and as long as badly is a regular adverb of manner (as in behaving badly), it holds. But bad has adverbial roles of its own, sanctioned by idiom, which effectively make it a zero adverb (see further under that heading). \n What is the role of bad when combined with verbs like look, smell, sound, taste? Being copular verbs, they can combine with adjectives or adverbs, and bad could be either in the idioms it looks/sounds bad if . . . , or the meat smells/tastes bad. (See further under copular verbs.) But when the meat has gone bad, bad is clearly more an adverb: compare the meeting went well. Further down the track is We didn’t do too bad, did we? which is idiomatic in North America and Australia, but not generally accepted in Britain. American English allows bad with all the verbs mentioned so far, and others, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). Needs it bad and wants it bad are standard idioms in which bad serves as an intensifier. American usage commentary has however become polarized: in the earlier C20 it went with this use of bad, but turned to censure in the second half. Purist reactions from Bernstein (1958) and the Harper-Heritage usage panels (1969, 1975) promoted the idea that wants it badly is “correct” style. Evans and Evans (1957) nevertheless thought that the construction with bad would become standard. This view gains supports from CCAE data, where instances of want/wants/wanted it bad outnumber those with badly by 5:2. Although the majority of constructions with bad are from quoted speech rather than newspaper commentary/editorial, they appear – varying with badly – in both types of discourse: \n “Now everybody wants it bad.” \n It can be done if we want it bad enough. \n The forcefulness of the construction with bad no doubt recommends itself to columnists, and the boundary between spoken and written styles is not hard and fast. More debatable now in the US are intensive uses of bad with less common verbs such as hate, hurt, screw up (as in it hurts bad), though there are handfuls of each in CCAE. The database confirms that (be) bad off (i.e. “lacking money or resources”) is current American idiom, outnumbering (be) badly off by more than 3:1. \n For the British, even wants it bad is too informal to appear in standard prose, according to Burchfield (1996) – let alone it hurts bad or bad off. The limits of acceptability for bad are set with copular verbs involving states of being or becoming. Feel bad appears in both written and spoken texts in the BNC – and is in fact much more common than feel badly, by a factor of 5:1. But there’s no place for hates it bad. \n The frontiers for bad as adverb are thus different in the US and the UK, and still being negotiated. Highly charged attitudes to its use are not so surprising, given the emotive and evaluative word that it is."

		"title": "baggage or luggage",
		"explanation":"The first Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) noted the American preference for baggage and British for luggage, remnants of which can still be found in the US terms baggage car and unclaimed baggage as opposed to luggage van and left luggage in the UK. But baggage and luggage are now used interchangeably in American and British English for the miscellany of bags, suitcases and odd-shaped objects which go with the traveler. Data from CCAE and the BNC show that luggage is the more common of the two – at least for American and British writers – although in airport signs, baggage is the word that strikes the eye, and it’s built into terms such as baggage systems, baggage handlers and excess baggage. \n Other, unrelated uses of baggage would help to explain why writers in both the US and the UK are increasingly inclined to use luggage. Since C17 baggage has been used to refer negatively to someone’s political, philosophical or psychological commitments, as in: \n dump their ideological baggage \n or \n the cold-war baggage of his predecessors \n In British English it’s possible to use luggage this way (as in their psychological luggage), according to New Oxford (1998). But there’s scant evidence of it in BNC, and all such predispositions are construed with baggage. This negative use of baggage is taken further in the phrase carry(ing) too much baggage, which makes any aspect of a political candidate’s past an impediment to his chances of success. \n For centuries baggage has also been used in allusive references to women. In C17 sources it was applied with relish, as in a saucy baggage, though this usage now seems dated or sexist. It may owe something to the notion of army baggage, helped by earlier French bagasse (“camp follower”), as suggested by Webster’s Third (1986). In current use baggage is most often an off-handed or derogatory term for the woman who wasn’t born yesterday: \n No-one could say the old baggage lacked for courage. \n She’s a talentless baggage who should keep her mouth shut. \n Baggage in this sense elaborates on the use of bag for “an unlikable woman.” Negative uses of baggage would help to explain why more writers are inclined to use luggage when referring to the traveler’s bags."

		"title": "bail or bale",
		"explanation":"These two spellings have been interchanged in several contexts, leaving some doubt as to which now goes where, especially in figurative extensions of the essential words. \n The origin of bale as in bale of hay is the Old French word balle meaning “package”; while for bail(s) as in cricket, it’s the older English baile meaning “stick.” A more literal use of bail is found in agricultural contexts, for the wooden partitions or frames by which farmers separate or restrain large animals. In Australia and New Zealand this was figuratively extended in the verb bail up, used originally of the bushranger waylaying travelers for their valuables, and now of anyone who buttonholes another against his/her will. \n The legal uses of bail derive from another Old French word, the verb bailler meaning “keep in custody.” The expression bail (someone) out (“help [someone] out of difficulties”) originates in this legal context, hence its spelling in: \n . . . bail out the Northern line from a vast increase in traffic. \n In fact this spelling is little used in the UK for the extended verb, according to BNC evidence, but much used in the US, as well as Australia and New Zealand. In the UK bail is usually a noun, caught up in phrases such as on bail and grant/refuse bail. \n Nautical use of bail out was traditionally spelled the same way, but by coincidence, since the phrase embodies the Old French word for a bucket: baille. In the US it is still spelled bail out, but bale out was gaining ground in the UK during C19, according to the first Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928), and has become the preferred spelling of the second edition (1989). When it comes to airmen making a parachute jump from their aircraft, this too is bail out in American English. It is bale out in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), yet not because it’s regarded as an extension of the nautical usage (an emergency measure in / exit from a vehicle). Instead, the dictionary relates it to the noun bale, and sees the manoeuvre as one where the parachutist exits from the aircraft like a bale (of hay etc.) through a trapdoor. \n In all this we see two solutions to a dilemma. The American solution is to use bail for every meaning except the nonlegal noun (bale of hay, straw, wool). The British solution is to reserve bail for legal uses (and cricket), and assign bale to other uses, especially the verbs associated with taking emergency measures and/or helping someone out of difficulty. The following examples from the BNC and CCAE respectively show the contrast for both transitive and intransitive uses: \n He could perhaps bale uncle out of the difficulties. (tr.) \n Kennedy would bail out the intelligence agency if need be. (tr.) \n He ordered the crew to bale out. (intr.) \n The crew of a 12-foot skiff bail out after their boat capsized. (intr.) \n The same spellings are applied in the related noun/modifier, as in British a bale-out scheme and American a government bailout. Etymologists may shake their heads, but at least there’s consistency. \n Quite independent of all that is the bale in baleful. Its spelling never varies, because it reflects the Old Norse word bal, meaning “fate.”"

		"title": "balk or baulk",
		"explanation":"The first spelling balk has much to recommend it. Apart from the analogy with common words like talk and walk, balk is the earlier spelling. In the US balk is standard for verb and noun uses, and the only spelling to be found in CCAE. Baulk is much more in evidence in the UK. Its use increased in the later C19, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928), and New Oxford (1998) makes it the primary spelling. Data from the BNC confirm the dominance of baulk for the noun referring to a large wooden beam, as in holed amidships by a baulk of timber. But baulk and balk are used equally for the verb, meaning “resist,” “stop short.” The divergent senses of verb and noun might explain the different spelling conventions in British English, although they are not differentiated elsewhere. Canadians – like Americans – prefer balk for both noun and verb, according to Canadian Oxford (1998), and Australians baulk, according to the Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n International English selection: The spelling balk is to be preferred for both noun and verb, given its wide distribution and etymological consistency. \n ♦ Compare caulk, calk or calque, where several meanings are involved."

		"title": "balmy or barmy",
		"explanation":"The colloquial adjective for someone who’s losing their mind is spelled balmy in the US, and barmy in the UK. The first evidence of this sense (from the 1850s) is attached to balmy by the Oxford Dictionary (1989), as an extension of its rather vague use in expressions like balmy weather. This explains the continuing use of balmy in American English, whereas barmy is a British respelling of balmy dating from the 1890s, now used regularly for the sense “crazy” as in gone barmy. So in the UK balmy is reserved for the climatic sense of “warm, benign,” and only rarely used to mean “crazy” (in less than 5% of all instances in BNC data). Barmy could hardly be substituted in the US, because the standard dialect is rhotic, i.e. pronounces the “r” after a vowel. \n Some dictionaries including New Oxford (1998) present barmy as derived independently from barm, a technical word for the froth on fermenting beer. Admittedly the Oxford Dictionary (1989) records figurative uses of barmy on isolated occasions from C17 on, but they refer to the creative brain in a ferment rather than suspected insanity. The two states of mind are of course proverbially close – though perhaps the barmy army of drunken hooligans at European football matches has provided a more direct link with barm."

There’s little to differentiate them, except that barbaric is the most frequent of the three as adjective, in data from the BNC, and barbarian has a parallel life as a noun for someone with savage or uncivilized ways. Note also that whereas barbarous always expresses condemnation, the judgement in barbaric varies with the phrase it appears in. In barbaric cruelty it’s clearly negative, while in barbaric splendor it connotes something which though primitive is impressive in its own way. \n In origin all three words represent a much less harsh judgement about those who stand outside our society and culture. The root barbar- embedded in them was used by the Greeks to describe the speech of the neighboring nations, which they found unintelligible. Thus barbarians were originally people who spoke a different language; and the name given to the Berbers may have originated in this way also. In modern English the tables are turned in the idiom “It was all Greek to me.”"

		"title": "barbarism",
		"explanation":"This word was once much less harsh as a comment on words and idioms (see previous entry). In C16 barbarism simply referred to a foreign word borrowed into English, though from C18 on, it served to stigmatize what were deemed mistakes in English words. Barbarisms were words malformed in terms of conventional usage or the usual patterns of word-formation, e.g. normalcy. They contrasted with solecisms, which were other kinds of error in syntax (see solecism). This technical application of barbarism makes it less heavy-handed, as Fowler (1926) noted. But commentators less scrupulous than Fowler have been known to deploy barbarism with all its primitive force to put down a particular usage. Barbarism then becomes a verbal weapon, often deployed in the face of popular support for the expression the writer/speaker wishes to expunge. It invokes social sanctions against it: no civilized person would utter it! See further under shibboleth."

Barbecue has exclusive backing from the Oxford Dictionary (1989), being much closer to the original word in Haitian Creole: barbacoa (“a framework of sticks on which meat is smoked”). It first appears in C17 English as barbacue, sometimes referring to a makeshift bed, and by 1733 had acquired its sense of a form of entertainment involving alfresco cooking and dining. Its popularity in the southern hemisphere is reflected in the shortened form barbie, used in Australia and New Zealand. \n The second spelling barbeque seems at first sight to frenchify the word, although the French would pronounce such a word with just two syllables, to rhyme with “dalek.” In fact the -que probably represents the third syllable of various abbreviations for the word, as bar-b-que, Bar-B-Q and BBQ."

		"title": "barring and bar",
		"explanation":"As prepositions identifying exceptions, these are both relatively uncommon and may raise questions of usage. Barring usually associates with negative events, as in barring accidents / a disaster / injuries / any last minute hitches. It commonly appears at the start of a sentence, raising suspicions that it may be a “dangling participle,” although its connections with the verb bar are now scarcely there (see dangling participles). For example: \n Barring coups, the four Southern Cone presidents will all still be in office in 1994. \n In fuller context, the phrase with barring has a good chance of being read absolutely, as intended: “Provided there are no coups d’´etat . . . ” (See absolute section 4.) Whether foregrounded in a sentence or set off in parentheses, it highlights a proviso to the statement being made. \n The preposition bar is a similarly efficient way of mentioning an exception to an implied set: \n closed to all bar buses and taxis \n everything bar the kitchen sink \n As in those cases, bar attaches itself to the pronoun that encompasses the whole set. The idiom bar none is attached to a superlative phrase, as in: \n the best young backs in the country bar none \n the sexiest actress in the world bar none \n The examples all show how bar is tied into formulas, whereas barring enjoys more flexible and productive use. When the two coincide, as in the following, barring seems to win out:  \n Nothing barring a major disaster can prevent her from becoming a main attraction. (Why not Nothing bar a major disaster . . . ?) \n Examples like this from the BNC suggest that barring is gaining ground while bar is losing it. The same trend emerges in data from CCAE, where examples of barring run in to hundreds, and those that there are of bar are confined to the idiom bar none."

Although some of the selections inevitably seem dated and culture-specific (e.g. servant), it would support general conversation anywhere. The larger objectives of Basic (English) are reflected in its being an acronym for British American Scientific International Commercial, though it would need to be supplemented with scientific terms – not to mention the names of countries and currencies – to go any way towards international communication. Basic English was endorsed by both Churchill and Roosevelt in the 1940s, but did not achieve any formal status as an auxiliary language.

In addition bathe can mean “take a swim” in the sea, hence the bathing costume and the bathing boxes for changing one’s clothes at the edge of the beach. In American usage, bathe refers not only to swimming but also to washing the baby, or oneself, by means of a bath or shower, and the verb bath is reserved for technical applications. Canadians can use either bathe or bath for personal ablutions, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). Australians distinguish between them much like the British (Macquarie Dictionary, 1997), but tend to use the verb shower for the cleansing activities in the bathroom. \n Note that when written down, bathing and bathed are ambiguous for readers familiar with both bath and bathe. Which verb do they relate to? Paraphrases such as having a bath/bathe and had a bath/bathe may be needed – unless the context (indoor/outdoor) settles it as one or other kind of encounter with water.

However BCE can still be read as “before the Christian era,” so the problem remains – as well as the fact that the “common” calendar has no connection with the dating systems used in Islam or other Asian traditions. These problems also affect CE, the corresponding term intended to replace AD. BC and BCE are both placed after the date itself: 50 BC, 50 BCE. Compare the position of AD, discussed under AD or A.D.

In some regional dialects of English, be serves instead of am, are, is for all persons of the present tense. In Black English, be indicates repeated or habitual action: People be leapin’ outta their seats. \n The most essential role of be is as one of the primary auxiliary verbs of English, used to express continuous action (to grammarians, the imperfect aspect), and the passive voice, as in the following: \n you are asking (continuous action / imperfect) \n you are asked (passive) \n Compare you ask with no auxiliary, expressing simple action in the active voice. (See further under auxiliary verbs, aspect and voice.) \n The verb be can also be used as a main verb on its own, in an existential sense: \n : I think therefore I am. \n Or it can be used as a copular verb, linking the subject of the clause with its complement: \n Their plan is a great leap forward. \n (See further under copular verbs.) \n The present forms of be are often contracted with their subject pronoun in the flow of conversation, as I’m, you’re, she’s, we’re, they’re.

In C18 this was ordinary written usage, and Merriam-Webster (2000) notes it as a current alternative for American English. However the use of beat as past participle is mostly found in particular idioms where the participle is passive, for example get/got beat and (can’t) be beat. Database evidence of this (from CCAE and the BNC) comes particularly from sports reporting in the US, and casual conversation in the UK: \n We got beat by a very good football team. \n If we get beat, it’s my fault. \n Can’t be beat (used of notional competition, as in a location that can’t be beat) is standard American idiom, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). Almost all instances of it in CCAE had beat rather than beaten as the past participle, whereas they were very rare in the BNC. Written data from CCAE also show the use of beat (as past participle) in the phrasal verb beat up, referring to acts of violence: \n . . . took him out of the Bronx where he had been beat up \n In the same construction, writers represented in the BNC use beaten: \n He was beaten up by a gang of white boys . . . \n Yet the participial adjective beat-up is found in English everywhere, referring especially to battered vehicles, as well as furniture, clothes and other things rather the worse for wear, from the beat-up hotel to beat-up sneakers. \n Although beat is built into various idioms as past participle, its appearance otherwise in that role connotes spoken rather than written style.

Americans are perhaps more inclined to beaus because of the need to distinguish it from a very different use of beaux in architectural comments such as [that] giant beaux arts bath house (= Union Station), where Beaux Arts is decapitalized as often in American style."

		"title": "beg the question",
		"explanation":"This phrase refers to a frustrating argumentative tactic, though it may be understood in one of three ways. Its curious wording reflects the fact that it translates the Latin phrase petitio principii (“begging the principle”), meaning that the speaker/writer assumes the fundamental premise or issue that ought to be discussed. Typically the issue is woven into another assertion or premise which effectively submerges it. The actual terms used in a discussion can beg the question, as recognized in the following: \n Some definitions of mental illness beg the question of what constitutes normal behavior. \n The problem with begged questions is that they compromise the scope of the discussion, preempting what the participants would need to focus on in order to gain a fresh perspective. \n The argumentative sabotage in begging the question is recognized by those who use it to mean “evade the issue.” This alternative use is acknowledged in Webster’s Third (1986), the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). While this understanding of beg the question strains the meaning of beg, it’s pragmatically closer to the original sense of the phrase than when it simply means “raise the question,” as in: \n Doesn’t three guitarists in three albums beg the question that Chadwick might be just a little hard on his sidemen? \n This third use of beg the question is now the commonest of the three, according to New Oxford (1998)."

But the rest was a mix of in behalf of, of behalf of and just plain behalf of, as in the claims of NUS to speak behalf of individual students. Dictionaries note that Americans use in behalf of as well as on behalf of, but in data from CCAE the latter is much more common, by about 20:1. There’s no evidence that in behalf of is restricted to a single sense, as commentators have sometimes suggested. The two senses associated with on behalf of (“in defense of ” / “to the benefit of ” and “as agent/representative for”) are both to be found in the American corpus for in behalf of: \n efforts in behalf of corporate clients \n versus \n sent telegrams in behalf of their 10,000 members \n However as the examples show, the two senses are not clearly separable. \n An extension of the second sense into “on the part of ” is occasionally heard and seen: That was a great shot on behalf of the young winger. It smacks of running commentary and the desire to embellish the facts. In edited text, this use of on behalf of would probably amount to overwriting of the simple fact that “the young winger produced a good shot.” Examples of this newest use of on behalf of are nevertheless making their way into print, according to Burchfield (1996), but it has yet to be registered in dictionaries. \n ♦ Compare on the part of, discussed at part of."

Its spelling in UK is behove, whereas in the US it’s always behoove. In American English it enjoys a slightly more varied existence, appearing in more and less formal contexts, and in more interactive prose – witness the following from CCAE: \n It would behoove the Senate to act promptly. \n Would it behoove you to look at your duty roster? \n It didn’t behoove me financially to go overseas. \n In other examples, the verbs accompanying behoove were will, may and might, giving it a wider range of modality and shades of obligation, from a broad imperative to the individual’s sense of what is fitting.

The e of noire is there to agree with bete ˆ , which happens to be a feminine noun in French. So the e should remain, even if your difficult person is masculine: bete noire ˆ applies to either gender. Yet the phrase is sometimes seen in English as bete noir, ˆ a spelling which is registered in Webster’s Third (1986) as an alternative. American examples from CCAE showed it to be indifferent to gender, applied to men, political opponents and even one’s mother-in-law. Examples of bete noir ˆ are also to be found in the BNC, though the form is not recognized in British dictionaries. \n Dictionaries in the UK, US, Canada and Australia all crown bete noire ˆ with its French circumflex, though it’s not crucial to the identity of the phrase (see accents).

It would be indispensable if you had to write: \n He was a better bettor than his partner. \n Yet the juxtaposition of the two seems far-fetched. Bettor is less likely than punter in most contexts – you could bet on it. \n In fact the spelling better is used generally in the UK for the person who lays bets, and it had the backing of Fowler (1926). It is more natural than bettor as the agent noun from an English verb (see further under -er/-or). In the US however, bettor is the preferred form, as shown in Webster’s Third (1986)."

The restriction on the use of between has certainly gone by the board, and Gowers declared it to be “superstition” in Complete Plain Words (1954). It is not uncommon for between to be used in expressions referring to more than two groups or reference points, as in a balance between deference, quotation and his own critical comment.

		"title": "between you and me (or I)",
		"explanation":"Those who always use between you and me have it easy, because it’s in line with what the traditional grammarians regard as correct use of pronouns. Yet between you and I is certainly used too, and for some people it is the usual formula to highlight a confidential point of conversation. The real issue is whether it should appear in writing. \n The phrase between you and I has a long history of both use and censure. Literary authors from Shakespeare on confirm its currency, yet it fell foul of C18 grammarians, and their zeal to preserve the remaining case distinctions (nominative/accusative) among the English pronouns. They argued that in between you and ???, both pronouns are objects of the preposition, and must therefore be accusative. This makes no difference for you but it demands me rather than I as the second pronoun. Of course, if it were between me and my dog, no-one would say or write otherwise. The use of me comes naturally then, because it is directly governed by between. The I probably gets into between you and I because it’s further away from the governing word. \n Other factors may help to foster the use of I, such as the fact that the phrase quite often comes immediately before the subject/nominative of a clause, as in: \n Between you and I, they won’t be here much longer. Using I may be a kind of hypercorrection, according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985), based on oversensitivity about using me (see further under me). The vacillation over me/I is symptomatic of shifting case relations among pronouns generally (Wales, 1996). But because between you and I seems to have become a shibboleth (see under that heading), it’s to be avoided in writing. In fact a confidential between you and I/me is unlikely to occur to anyone writing a formal document, because of the impersonal character of the style that goes with it."

		"title": "bi-",
		"explanation":"This prefix comes from Latin with the meaning “two,” though in a handful of English words it means “twice.” Examples of the first meaning (“two”) are easily found in everyday and general words such as: \n bicentenary bicycle biennial bifocals \n bigamy binary binoculars bipartisan \n as well as scientific words such as: \n bicarbonate biceps bicuspid \n biped bisexual bivalve \n The second meaning (“twice”) is found only in biannual and sometimes in bimonthly and biweekly. It arose only in C20, and unfortunately makes for chronic difficulty in interpreting those words. None of the other number prefixes 1 to 10 has this duality of meaning (see number prefixes). The distinction between biennial and biannual is easiest to remember if you’re a gardener working with biennial asters which last for two years, or someone who attends biennial exhibitions which take place every two years. Without the support of such contexts, a reader may well be in doubt. Does a biannual meeting take place twice a year or every two years? Dictionaries which distinguish biennial (“every two years”) from biannual (“twice a year”), also note that biannual is sometimes used with the meaning of biennial. For a writer, there is always the risk of not being interpreted as you intend and it’s safer to use a paraphrase. One can replace biannual with “twice a year,” and biennial with “every two years.” \n Alternatively you could use the prefix semi- and semiannual instead of biannual, as Webster’s English Usage (1989) suggests. This works well enough for semimonthly and semiweekly also, because semicombines with both classical and English words (see semi-). Fortnightly is also useful as a paraphrase for “every two weeks / twice a month,” in something intended for British readers. But fortnight and fortnightly are unfamiliar to Americans. \n ♦ Compare the prefix di-."

They are the primary spellings in all the major dictionaries: New Oxford (1998), Webster’s Third (1986), Canadian Oxford (1998), the Australian Macquarie (1997). The forms with double s were evidently quite common in C19, but with both Fowler (1926) and the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) arguing against them, their currency has been greatly reduced. The single s spelling represents the more regular principle for verbs ending in a single consonant, though British and American English don’t always agree on this (see doubling of final consonant). \n The plural of the noun bias is not commented on in the dictionaries, which implies that it is the regular biases.

This divergence no doubt reflects their different orientation to the use of capitals generally (see capital letters), rather than any religious difference. In this book, bible is usually lower-cased because it appears in paraphrases of the formal title, e.g. the King James bible. Figurative uses of the word, such as the “cyclist’s bible” or “military planners’ bible,” naturally have the word without a capital."

Note that in some academic disciplines, it includes any item read or consulted in writing the book. Others prefer to restrict the list to items which are actually cited in the text, which makes it a “List of references” rather than “Works consulted.” \n The form of the bibliography varies with the chosen referencing system in matters such as the order of items, alphabetization, and the forms of names. There are also many small points of style in punctuation and abbreviations which vary with the publishing house, the journal and its editor, and a writer should always check for their particular preferences. Generic disciplinary guides are to be found for: \n ∗ humanities in the Chicago Manual of Style (2003) and the MLA (Modern Languages Association) Style Manual (2nd. ed. 1999) \n ∗ social sciences in the APA (American Psychological Association) Style Manual (5th. ed. 2001) \n ∗ natural sciences in the CBE (Council of Biology Editors) Manual (6th. ed. 1994 = Scientific Style and Format). \n What follows are token bibliographies to illustrate the different formats used to complement each of the main referencing systems: \n A. short-title references, in the text and footnotes/endnotes \n B. author–date references (also called the “Harvard” or name–year system) \n C. number system (with “Vancouver” style) \n For the forms of the references themselves, see referencing. \n A.

Int. J of Lexicography 1993; 6:2. \n Points to note \n **Order of entries: \n – The order of entries is alphabetical in A and B. In C the order is dictated by the numbers, which run in accordance with the appearance of each item within the text. \n **Authors’ names and initials \n – In all three systems the names of all authors are inverted (Ritter, 2002). The practice of inverting the first author’s name but not the second or others is in abeyance. \n – Initials are occasionally used in A for the full first names of authors, usually in B, and always in C. In C the initials are written without stops, and the word and is omitted between the names of joint authors. \n **Date of publication \n – The date is placed immediately after the name(s) of the author(s) in B, but not A or C. \n **Titles of articles, chapters, books and journals \n – The use of capitals in titles and subtitles varies, though the minimal capitalization of librarians has much to recommend it. (See further under titles.) \n – The titles of articles or chapters of books have in the past been set in quotation marks. This practice is now rare in the natural sciences (see CBE Manual, 1994), and declining in the social sciences and humanities (Webster’s Style Manual, 1985). The Chicago Manual (2003) notes that quote marks are not used for the titles of articles and chapters in author– date style (B). Speaking for British practice, Butcher (1992) notes that they are not essential in bibliographies. \n – Italics are normally used in A and B to set off the title of the book or the name of the journal. \n – In Vancouver style (C) the generic parts of the names of journals are abbreviated. The recognized abbreviations for medicine and biomedical research are detailed each year in the January issue of the Index Medicus. Abbreviations for other fields of research may be found in Chemical Abstracts, World List of Scientific Periodicals, in British Standard BS 4148 and in American National Standard Z39.5 1985. \n – In references to chapters or parts of a book, the book’s title should appear before that of the editors, according to the Chicago Manual. However the Vancouver system gives the name(s) of the editor(s) first. \n  **Publishing details \n – In the publication details, the place of publication often precedes the name of the publisher. This was not always so, but it’s the practice of both Butcher’s Copy-editing and the Chicago Manual; and it makes good sense these days in the era of multinational publishing. If the place is subsumed in the actual name of the publisher, as for Melbourne University Press, there’s no need to repeat it. \n – In Vancouver Style (C), the publisher’s name may be abbreviated, for example with Univ Pr for “University Press.” See CBE Manual (1994) for further details. Ampersands should be used, as in Harper & Row, in both B and C styles. \n **Punctuation \n – The overall trend in punctuating bibliographical entries is to greater simplicity. Periods / full stops are preferred as the device between separate items, instead of the array of commas and parentheses used in the past. Within each component, commas and colons may be used, as shown above."

		"title": "bicentennial or bicentenary",
		"explanation":"The celebration of a national 200th birthday calls for extensive public use of either or both of these words, as nouns and adjectives. Americans celebrating their two centuries of independence called it the bicentennial. This usage came naturally, and it has the backing of the Oxford Dictionary (1989), because it builds in the Latin root for “years” (enn-). Yet Fowler (1926) argued that bicentenary was to be preferred for the noun, on grounds of analogy (see under centennial); and that bicentennial should be used only as adjective. British usage as represented in the BNC still goes along with this. Most instances of bicentenary were unequivocally nouns (i.e. non-attributive use), whereas most of those for bicentennial were adjectival – or at least attributive – as in bicentennial celebrations (see further under adjectives section 1). \n Australians celebrating their 200th birthday in 1988 faced the dilemma of knowing both American and British usage. The Australian Bicentennial Authority decided to call the event the Bicentenary, and thus seemed to put Fowler’s distinction in place. Yet the event was commonly referred to as the Bicentennial. Three factors help to explain this: \n ∗ the much reported American and French bicentennials of the same decade \n ∗ the fact that bicentennial in its attributive use (as in Bicentennial Authority) is easily understood as a noun, since nouns often take on that role in English, witness birthday celebration. \n ∗ the fact that many classical adjectives have evolved into independent nouns in English: see further under -al and -ary \n The Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) and the Canadian Oxford (1998) both allow that bicentennial can be a noun as well as adjective – like bicentenary. \n International English selection: Since bicentennial serves as an independent noun in American, Canadian and Australian English, there is no reason to replace it with bicentenary in that role."

		"explanation":"The plural of biceps could be biceps, bicepses or even bicipites if you know your Latin. Most people choose between the first two, effectively using either the zero plural or the regular English -es plural. The use of just biceps as the plural is probably swelled by those who are unsure whether one or more rippling biceps is being referred to. With its final s biceps looks already like a plural, and it probably diverts the uncertain user from adding a further plural ending to it. In any case, it’s a perfectly acceptable form. Other muscles such as the triceps and quadriceps have the same alternative plurals. \n Forceps is both similar and a little different. The plural could be forceps, forcepses or forcipes. (The Latin plural of forceps differs because it derives from the verb capere [cip-] “take” rather than the noun caput [capit-] “head.”) With forceps there is a stronger incentive to settle on the zero plural, because of the analogy with pliers, scissors and other familiar tools with double blades or arms.

The word biker is applied in both the US and the UK to recreational and mountain bike riders as well as members of motorcycle gangs, with their often violent and lawless activities. Biker gear (i.e. leather jackets) and biker movies are associated with the latter, although the scene is complicated in the US by the so-called “Rubbies” (Rich Urban Bikers) who scarcely fraternize with the conventional groupies. Australians meanwhile use bikie to designate the motorcycle gang members and distinguish them from recreational riders (= biker). \n Cyclist serves in both the UK and the US to refer to the independent recreational biker as well as the professional cycling champion. Again the collocations help to show which subculture is intended: mountain cyclists on the hiker–biker trail or the Olympic cyclist. Some dictionaries note cycler as a synonym for cyclist, but there is scant evidence of its use in British or American corpora. \n Though biker and cyclist overlap in their coverage of the cycling scene, the context normally clarifies which of the three subcultures is intended. Biker is less frequent than cyclist in either American or British databases, though the difference is more marked in British English. In CCAE they appear in the ratio of 2:3, whereas in the BNC it’s about 1:3. Constraints on biker are suggested by the label “informal” or “colloquial” found in British dictionaries. Yet the stylistic difference has nothing to do with their relative age, since both are on record from the 1880s. Rather it may correlate with word forms. Cyclist keeps the classical look of the word (based on Latin cyclus), whereas biker abbreviates and anglicizes it. Linguistic scruples like these are probably reinforced by the negative associations of biker with motorcycle gangs."

British usage has changed during the last twenty years, bringing it into line with American on this crucial issue, and so a billion means “a thousand million” (Ritter, 2002), rather than “a million million.” The changeover was led by British financial institutions such as the Treasury, and has been reflected in reporting by the London Financial Times and The Economist for some time. It puts Britain out of step with the EU, where both France and Germany use the term milliard/Milliarde for “a thousand million,” and billion means “a million million.” But it is in step with the US, Canada (Canadian English Usage, 1997), and the Australian government Style Manual (2002). \n There is nevertheless some continuing danger within the UK of billion being understood in terms of the old value. British style guides such as Butcher’s (1992) urge writers to spell out numerical values involving billions whenever they are critical. So however convenient it is to put £4 billion or £4 b. in the headline, or anywhere else, it’s more ambiguous than £4,000,000,000, or £4000 million. \n The meaning of billion affects the value of trillion, quadrillion, quintillion etc. Thus in the English-speaking world, the trillion is now 1012, whereas for France and Germany it’s 1018. And so on. \n The variable values for billion etc. have not been a problem for mathematicians and scientists, who routinely deal with very large numbers in terms of powers of ten. Astronomers measure the vast distances of the universe by means of light-years or parsecs (the distance equal to a heliocentric parallax of one second of arc). Geologists bypass billion by estimating past time in terms of the mega-annum (Ma) or millions of years (variously abbreviated as my, m.y., m.yr). In the North American system the most remote time is expressed with the one unit, e.g. 3400 Ma, whereas the European geologic system uses both mega-annum and giga-annum (CBE Manual, 1994). So 3400 Ma equals 3.4 Ga. \n ♦ For more on the standard numerical prefixes, see Appendix IV; and on geological eras, Appendix II."

		"title": "black or Black",
		"explanation":"This word has been used since C17 to translate the Spanish negro, and to refer to the dark-skinned people encountered by colonial settlers in Africa, Australia and elsewhere. In the US it chiefly referred to Africans transported as slaves and was a common designation until after the Civil War, when replaced by the older “colored” and then “Negro” (see further under colo(u)red). Black was revived by the Civil Rights Movement around 1970 as an affirmation of ethnic identity, and actively promoted in the slogan Black is beautiful. In expressions like Black Power and Black English it always carries a capital letter, but not in generic references. Data from both CCAE and BNC show that black resists capitalization, even when paired with other ethnic descriptors, as in blacks and Mexicans. Newspaper coverage of events in South Africa also uses lower case: \n . . . acute shortage of housing for blacks in South Africa’s urban areas \n But Australian Aborigines use Black (with capital letter) in self-reference, paralleling the American Black Power movement, and affirming the general principle of capitalizing ethnic names (see capital letters section 1b). Compounds such as blackfella are not however capitalized. In the UK, black may refer to either Jamaican or Asian immigrants, and is not a solidarity name for the people concerned. \n Like any racial designator, the word black can be prejudicial to the peoples referred to, especially when used indiscriminately by whites. The fact that black/Black is used in self-reference by the people concerned does not license others to do the same. The dilemma prompted the late C20 search for alternatives which could be used in public communication, with some success in establishing geographic/national names, such as African American, African Canadian etc. They have the advantage of being in line with those for other immigrants, e.g. German-American, and of allowing for finer discriminations as in Nigerian Canadian (Jamaican, Trinidadian etc).

		"title": "Black English",
		"explanation":"Recognition of ethnic varieties such as Black English is relatively recent, and represents acknowledgement of its status as one of the “English languages” (McArthur, 1998). American Black English probably developed out of the plantation creole used by African slaves and became then decreolized in contact with standard American English, although its relationship with white Southern dialects is still debated. In three decades it has been the most intensely researched form of American English (Schneider, 1996), its name revised several times, from Black English to Black English Vernacular (BEV) to African American English Vernacular (AAVE). In 1996 its status as a separate dialect or language, called Ebonics, was highlighted in the debate over the attempts of one California school district to obtain funding for disadvantaged students under a bilingualism support program. Most of the characteristics of AAVE are paralleled in regional dialects of English, although several features of its noun and verb morphology are unique (Wolfram and Schilling-Estes, 1998). They include the omission of -s from plural and possessive nouns; of -s from the third person singular present tense of verbs; and special uses of been and be, to indicate action done a long time ago, and habitual use (see under be). \n In other parts of the world, the term Black English continues to be used to designate the variety used by ethnic Africans. In Britain, the variety of English used by Caribbean immigrants in London is also referred to as Black English. In western and southern Africa, Black English as used by indigenous people distinguishes it from English used by European settlers and their descendants. (See further under South African English.) In Australia the variable forms of Aboriginal English are known to their users as blackfella talk."

		"title": "blink",
		"explanation":"New applications of this verb intersect with old, and with several different constructions. Its essential physical meaning, i.e. “close and open the eye,” is extended now to a range of devices that flash regularly, from distress signals to the cursor on your computer. See for example: \n Traffic signals blink yellow. \n The red light on his car phone began to blink. \n The emotional significance of blinking in showing surprise remains a not uncommon use, often in negative constructions as in: . . .  \n doesn’t blink at the mess \n No-one should blink when (an Olympic site is converted to a prison) \n The reference librarian didn’t even blink. He gets requests like that everyday (for a book on the methodology of murder) \n Transitive constructions, such as didn’t blink an eye (or an eyelash) also embody this sense of (not) showing surprise. \n The physical and emotional aspects of blinking are of course a liability amid the continuous tension of competitive sport, whether it’s baseball or boxing. Hence the importance of not being the side to blink first. Spectators too must be provided with no-blink coverage of the game by the TV station (no responsibility if they doze off themselves). This metaphorical use of blink to mean “lose concentration” and so “give way” has leaped out of the sporting arena, at least in North American English, and can be applied to a backdown in politics. Among the various examples in CCAE, it becomes a question of which side will blink first (in talks with Israel). This usage is recognized in both Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998), but not yet in New Oxford (1998) or the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n Blinking is everywhere used as a metaphor for having the eyes closed when one might be expected to notice something untoward. This too can be transitive or intransitive, as in the local problem of blink-your-eye deals, or the international one when nations blink at [another’s] political and human rights outrages. Both at and away appear in such constructions, witness blink the problem away for a year. Control of one’s own blinking is definitely imputed here, whereas in most other uses it is deemed involuntary, or at least subject to external forces. \n Modern blink seems to be the intersection of two different verbs. Its owes its spelling to the Scottish form of Old English blench “recoil”/“flinch” (see under blanch or blench) – which underpins its use with that sense in North America. Its association with the eyes is thought to come from the Middle Dutch verb blinken (“shine”; cf. German blinken, “sparkle”)."

		"title": "bloc or block",
		"explanation":"Borrowed from French bloc in C14, block is anglicized in spelling and supports an array of meanings both physical and figurative. In C20 it was for several decades used to refer to political groupings, for example when referring to the block vote of Welsh miners. \n The spelling bloc is a C20 reborrowing of the same French word, used only in the political sense. In English its earliest application (1903) was to political alignments in western Europe, but after World War II the most common collocations were communist bloc / Eastern bloc / Soviet bloc. It is now used freely of political groupings of any persuasion, anywhere in the world, whether supranational – e.g. imperial bloc, Islamic bloc, trading bloc – or intranational. In American data from CCAE, the malleable suburban voting bloc, or the bloc of white voters may be the key to the next election. Clearly bloc is taking over where block might previously have served, whenever it correlates with a power bloc. Hence the significance of a bloc of seats in the Serbian parliament, as opposed to the contiguous block of seats. It explains also the choice of spelling in a geographical bloc, off limits to Palestinian police, referring to a settlement in Gaza."

		"title": "blond or blonde",
		"explanation":"As often when there’s a choice of spellings, people assign different roles to them. The common practice with these is to use blond in reference to males, and blonde for females. This is rather like what French does with grammatical as well as natural gender (see gender), and the tendency can be seen in both American and British English. Most citations in both CCAE and the BNC have blond and blonde applied on the basis of natural gender, whether speaking of a person, or the color of her/his hair: a stunning blonde, a blonde woman, blonde hair. Although references to a man as a blond were rare in both databases, blond hair was frequently associated with a male head: an idealised portrait of Jesus with blond hair and blue eyes. In both corpora, blond was associated with nonhuman color references, as in built of blond stone or the blond-dune area in Namibia. \n Yet for some writers, there’s a grammatical distinction to be made with blond and blonde, whereby blonde is reserved for the noun (the stereotyped female), and blond used as the general adjective in blond-haired, blond wood etc. This is illustrated in the juxtaposition of British Blondes with thanks to [whom] blond hair became a mark of feminine beauty, in a citation from the New York Times Book Review (1983) quoted in Webster’s English Usage (1989). The sense of a grammatical divide probably derives from the fact that blond is not often used as a noun in either British or American English: its frequency in that role is low in both the reference databases. By the same token, the two words appear freely as adjectives – the main difference being that blonde is more common as adjective in BNC data (in the ratio of about 3:2), whereas in CCAE, blond has a slight lead over blonde (a ratio of about 6:5). However the adjectival data from both databases confirm the strong tendency to use blonde in female references and blond in those to males, i.e. the natural gender principle. \n The clich´ed application of blond(e) to female and male hair color has meant a loss of specificity, hence the need to qualify it as ash/gray/silvery blond(e) among CCAE examples, and dark/strawberry/ platinum blonde from the BNC. Both databases provide evidence of peroxide blond(e). The ages of the persons referred to extends now from juveniles – a blue-eyed blond tot – to the cricketing idol – blond, handsome, with great charisma – to the follicularly challenged: his hair – blond, thinning on top. The sexist implications of blond(e) may be dwindling. \n ♦ Compare brunette or brunet."

		"title": "bloody",
		"explanation":"Used as an intensifier, bloody was once a word to blush over. However the Oxford Dictionary (1989) records this use since 1785, and it has long been a feature of talk among men, though avoided (like other swear words) in mixed company. The former taboo and its association with casual and coarse communication still combine to limit its appearances in print. Among the examples in CCAE, some seem to exploit the literal connection with blood as well, and the ambiguity could no doubt be used in defence if necessary: \n bloody brutes like Rambo \n teach them a bloody lesson in betrayal and revenge \n SHEER BLOODY MURDER (reported from a Johannesburg newspaper) \n Other examples are unmistakably expletive, though put on the lips of sports trainers: \n “Unless you bust a bloody gut . . . you’ll never win a bloody race.” \n Or reviewers of movies, influenced as it were by the dialogue itself: \n . . . a bloody awful denouement \n Or John Lennon: “They still use the bloody comparisons.” \n How common is it overall? In nonfiction, including journalism, quite rare. Less than 3% of all instances of bloody in CCAE were intensifiers (even if we include ambiguous examples like those above). In the BNC things appear on first sight to be the reverse: little use of bloody in its literal sense of “associated with blood,” and much of the intensifier (bloody idiot; waste of bloody time etc.). Yet almost all instances of intensifier use come from (i) transcribed speech, and (ii) fictional dialogue designed to communicate the intensity and rhythm of everyday speech. Writers who are not exercising novelist’s license are still pretty circumspect about using it in print."

In earlier centuries the regular blowed was also used occasionally for both, but it survives with the general meaning only in dialect. No doubt this has something to do with the use of blowed (and blow) in imprecations such as Well I’ll be blowed or I’m blowed if I’m going to, on record since 1781 according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). For most speakers, blowed is imbued with that colloquial color."

Coined by American humorist Gelett Burgess in 1907, blurb remains the only simple way to refer to the remarks printed on the dust jacket of a book to promote sales. Since then it has consolidated its identity as a genre of advertising, with predictably glowing words (brilliant, extraordinary, masterly, outstanding) and often extravagant claims about the book’s contents. Blurb is now also applied to discursive promotional material used for various kinds of entertainment or infotainment, on movie flyers, concert programs, tourist pamphlets and software packaging. The blurb’s hyperbole no doubt raises skepticism in most readers, but the word itself has established its place in the English language. In North American English it can be used as a verb as well as a noun, according to Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998).

The table below sets the order of spellings from the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986). \n The dictionaries agree on the preferred spelling for the golfing term (bogey), and that bogie should be used for “wheel assembly,” but diverge over the primary spelling for “bugbear.” Data from both CCAE and the BNC show that bogy is now very rare in the US as well as the UK, and that bogey is often used for this sense. The use of [old] Bogey in preemptive references to the Devil may have helped it along. Bogeyman now far outnumbers bogyman for the compound, by more than 3:1 in CCAE, and 50:1 in the BNC. \n Though bogey now spells the golfing term as well as “bugbear,” their contexts of use help keep the two senses apart – except perhaps for superstitious golfers. And though the plural bogies once served both bogy (“bugbear”) and bogie (“wheel assembly”), it’s now firmly attached to the latter. As a proper name, Bogie refers to the American movie star Humphrey Bogart (1899–1957), at least in the US; and Bogey to the British Colonel Bogey, who gave his name to the standard (par) score in golf (Brewer’s Dictionary, 1986), and a military march associated with two world wars. \n ♦ For other words which vary between -ie and -y or -ey and -y in spelling, see -ie/-y and -ey."

		"title": "boggle",
		"explanation":"This curious verb seems to derive from the same Celtic word for “ghost” as bog(e)y (“bugbear”) and bug (“gremlin”) (see further under bogey and bug). The earliest use of boggle (C16) is of a horse starting in fright as if from “seeing a ghost.” A similar sense is embodied in the mind boggles, and this intransitive construction is the normal pattern for boggle in British English. In American English it’s turned around. It boggles the mind is much more common than the mind boggles, and transitive uses of boggle outnumber the intransitive by about 8:1, in data from CCAE. American usage allows some variation of the idiom, so that the object of boggling may be the imagination / my creativity or the most analytical mind – not to mention the White House as in Computer sabotage boggles the White House. Extended uses of the intransitive construction can be seen in BNC data, as in: \n the mind boggles at the potential \n the mind boggles at what might happen \n Apart from using at, the data show the occasional use of with instead of at when the complement is a noun phrase, and that when it’s a clause."

Bon vivant is still much more widely used to refer to one who enjoys the pleasures of good living, but the presence of the other has prompted some demarcation disputes over meaning. \n For some, the two phrases are synonymous. For others, the focus of bon vivant is especially on the epicurean delights of the table, whereas bon viveur implies the indulgences of the trendy man-about-town (and the “Don Juan”).

		"title": "bona fides and bona fide",
		"explanation":"These are two forms of the same Latin phrase with different applications. Bona fides is used in English to mean “good faith or honest intention,” and agrees with a singular verb as in: \n The litigant’s bona fides was queried by the judge. \n  A shortage of Latin outside the court of law has it often understood as a plural (see false plurals for other examples). Verb agreements in both American and British databases confirmed this, and there were no instances with a singular verb. This shift in agreement is probably fostered by extended applications, so that it can now mean “proof(s) of being genuine” or “credentials,” as in: \n . . . unidentified sources whose bona fides have not been established. \n These extensions of bona fides showed up first in the context of intelligence operations, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989); then diplomatic contexts, as in the following from the BNC and CCAE: \n Mr de Klerk’s bona fides remain unproven. \n South Africa’s bona fides are now accepted. \n In American English bona fides may be acknowledged in almost any field of endeavor, political, professional or personal: egalitarian bona fides; literary bona fides; the home-ec. teacher’s bona fides; bona fides as a spokesman for black rage. \n Bona fide is the ablative of bona fides, meaning “in good faith” (see further under ablative).

Born is only used in expressions which refer to coming into the world, whether it is an actual birth (born on Christmas Day) or a figurative use (not born yesterday). Borne serves as the all-purpose past participle of the verb bear, as in: \n The oil slick was borne away by the tide. \n Both born and borne are related to the verb bear, and there was no systematic difference in their spelling until the last quarter of C18. Earlier editions of Samuel Johnson’s dictionary (up to 1773) gave the past participle of bear as either “bore or born.” But borne had been widely used in C16 and C17, and it gradually replaced the other two as the general past participle, leaving born with its restricted role."

It occurs much more often than bosoms, in both BNC and CCAE, in the ratio of more than 6:1 and about 4:1. In references to female anatomy bosom is not intrinsically erotic, though on the pages of a romantic novel it may become so. It may be explicitly anerotic, an element of pity, as in all her poor sad bosom, or satire: heaving bosom appropriately cantilevered for the occasion. \n The plural bosoms is a recent development, as of 1959, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). It draws attention to the twinness of the female bosom, and appears naturally enough in titillating contexts (or commentaries on them), as in the movie moment at which bosoms heaved and manhood stirred. Its association with seduction sometimes makes for unintended comedy, as in the attempt to avoid a scandal in the bosoms of the Church; or the unskilled historical novelist whose knights smote their armored bosoms in a gesture of fealty."

		"explanation":"The implications of bourgeois (“citizen”) are rarely neutral, though the precise nature of the judgement it passes, whether political, social or aesthetic, is relative to context. When first used in C17 English, it brought its French reference to those who earned their living in the city (e.g. by mercantile means) and incurred some contempt by so doing from landed gentry. Following the industrial revolution, and in Marxist thinking, bourgeois correlated with the privileged managerial class and exploiters of the proletariat. Contemporary expressions of the model are to be found in statements like the following from the BNC: \n The notion of thrift carried little meaning; it was essentially part of a bourgeois economic outlook largely incompatible with proletarian living conditions. \n From both political angles, bourgeois has the negative vibes associated with “middle class.” In C20 English bourgeois acquired a further critical meaning as in bourgeois taste, implying aesthetic or social values which are conventional, mediocre and even philistine. This seems to be a democratized extension of the original political sense, as in: \n Free verse has been exposed as decadent, and modern art as the shopworn property of the bourgeois masses. \n Sometimes the word seems to serve simply as a putdown, as in That’s a terribly bourgeois view.

		"explanation":"The role of brackets is to separate a string of words or characters from those on either side. They come in five different shapes each with its own functions which are detailed below. The punctuation problems which arise with parentheses in particular are also discussed below, sections 2 and 3. \n 1 Types of brackets \n a) Parentheses ( ), sometimes called “round brackets,” often enclose a parenthetical comment or parenthesis within a carrier sentence: \n Angkor (the ancient capital of the Khmer empire) is situated hundreds of miles upstream from Phnom Penh. \n In such a sentence the parenthetical words could also be set off with either commas, em rules / dashes or spaced en rules / dashes (see dashes section 1). The three types of punctuation are also used by some to represent different degrees of separation. Commas are felt to make the least separation between the parenthesis and the rest of the sentence, then parentheses, and then dashes. Yet whether all three levels can be usefully exploited in the same sentence is doubtful. \n Practice and principle vary even for indicating two levels of parenthesis. Some authorities allow a combination of dashes with parentheses – with dashes on the outside, according to the Chicago Manual (2003), or on the inside, following The Right Word at the Right Time (1985). When nested brackets are needed, American style combines square brackets with parentheses (the brackets on the inside). British style as expressed in the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) warns against doing this, because of the convention of using square brackets for editorial interpolations (see section 1b below). Instead it recommends using parentheses within parentheses, taking care to close each set in turn. \n Other uses of parentheses are to: \n ∗ enclose optional additions to a word, when the author wants to allow for alternative interpretations or applications of a statement. For example: Students will take their additional subject(s) in their own time. \n  ∗ enclose numbers or enumerative letters in a list. If they are in continuous text it’s usual to put brackets on either side: (i), (ii) etc., but when they stand at the margin in a list (as in this entry), the second bracket alone is enough. \n ∗ enclose a whole sentence which forms a parenthesis within a paragraph. \n ∗ provide a locus for author–date references (see referencing). b) Square brackets [ ] are conventionally used in prose to indicate editorial additions to the text, whether they explain, correct, or just comment on it in the form of [sic]. Other examples are: \n . . . went home [to New Zealand] \n  and died shortly after. . . . \n [cont. p. 166] \n In mathematics, square brackets are used in a hierarchy with parentheses and braces, but there the convention runs counter to that mentioned in (1a), and parentheses are to be dealt with before square brackets, according to both Chicago and the CBE Manual (1994). \n In linguistics, square brackets are used to enclose phonetic (as opposed to phonemic) symbols. Cf. (1d) below. \n c) Braces { }, sometimes called “curly brackets,” are used as distinguishing brackets in mathematics, after parentheses and square brackets. The conventional order for enclosures is thus {[( )]}, working from the inside out \n In linguistics braces identify the morphemes of a language. (See under morphology.) \n d) Slash brackets / /, also called diagonal brackets or “slashes,” serve to separate the numbers in a date, as in 11/11/88. In Britain they were used in sums of money to separate pounds from the smaller denominations (see further under solidus). \n In linguistics, slash brackets mark phonetic symbols which have phonemic status for the language concerned. The phonemes of English are listed in Appendix I, using the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet. \n e) Angle brackets  are used in mathematics as the outermost set in the hierarchy {[( )]}. In linguistics they show the graphemes of a particular writing system, for instance the (gh) in ghost. As printed they are sometimes identical with paired chevrons (see further under that heading). \n 2 Use of stops with brackets/parentheses. Punctuation outside any pair of parentheses, and especially after the parenthesis, is determined by the structure of the host sentence. Compare the following sentences: \n Their last act was passable (no unexpected mishaps), and so the show earned a modicum of applause. \n The last act of the show was passable (no unexpected mishaps) and amusing. \n Without its parenthesis, the second sentence would certainly not have had a comma, so there’s no reason to add one with the parenthesis. \n Within the brackets themselves there is minimal punctuation: only exclamation or question marks if required, unless the parenthesis stands as an independent sentence. Compare: \n He said (no-one would have predicted it) that he would run for president. \n He said he would run for president. (No-one would have predicted it.) \n Note in the first of these sentences, the absence of initial capital and full stop in the parenthesis, because it is embraced within another sentence. Only when the parenthesis contains a title, or some stock saying, would capitals be introduced: \n Tomorrow’s lecture (Language and Social Life) has been cancelled. \n Their grandmother’s imperative (Waste not want not) had them saving every plastic bag that came into the house. \n 3 The final stop/period: inside or outside a parenthetical bracket? When a sentence ends with a parenthesis, the point to check is whether the parenthesis forms part or all of the sentence. If it is the whole sentence, the stop goes inside; if the parenthesis is only the last part of the sentence, the stop goes outside. Compare: \n He said she was guilty. (No-one believed him.) \n He said that she was guilty (in spite of appearances). \n Note that this rule for the placement of the final period is the same throughout the English-speaking world, whereas the ones relating to stops and quotation marks are variable. See quotation marks section 3c."

		"title": "Brahmin, Brahman and Brahm(a)",
		"explanation":"Several applications need to be distinguished in deciding between these spellings. Either Brahmin or Brahman may be used for: \n 1 a member of the highest or priestly caste among the Hindus \n 2 a breed of Indian cattle used in crossbreeding animals for warmer latitudes. \n The Oxford Dictionary (1989) gives priority to Brahmin while Webster’s Third (1986) makes it Brahman. However data from British and American corpora show that Brahmin is actually the commoner spelling for sense 1 and Brahman for sense 2. Brahmin is essentially the older spelling, according to the Oxford, which helps to explain why it’s also the spelling used for the Boston Brahmins (members of the old established families of New England, highly cultivated and aloof), and elsewhere in American English for individuals of the same type. The concept is applied in Australia in references to the Adelaide brahmin (lower case). The few examples of brahmin (lower case) in the BNC were used in reference to the Hindu caste, but otherwise upper case prevailed in the British and the American evidence. \n One further use of Brahman emerged from the databases. Both CCAE and the BNC yielded several instances in which Brahman referred to the pervasive world spirit or oneness of all things in Buddhist philosophy. This seems to be C20 innovation. The Oxford Dictionary gives Brahm and Brahma as the distinctive spellings for this, but there are no citations for it after mid-C19."

		"title": "breach, breech or broach",
		"explanation":"Breach is the hinge in the interplay between these, since it sounds exactly like breech, and comes close to broach in meaning. Breech is the least common of them, once a general word for “trousers” (cf breeches), but now mostly found referring to the rear end of something, and used in association with childbirth (breech birth) and a style of guns (breech loaders). \n Breach comes from the same root as the word break, though its applications are much more limited. It can refer to a physical break, as in a breach in the dike (or in the defences of the football team), but more often it connotes a figurative rupture, in law or in personal relations: a breach of the peace, a breach of promise. As a verb breach also appears in both figurative and physical senses. Its figurative use in breach the agreement is uncomplicated, whereas the physical sense in breach the dike is at some risk of overlapping with broach. The effect of breaching a dike is not unlike that of broaching a keg: in either case liquid pours through the hole. Still there’s a difference, in that breaching is normally the work of nature and broaching a human act. Broach is a term from joinery and carpentry for a tapered spike used to enlarge a hole. The more figurative use of broach in broaching a subject is again a matter of opening something up, this time a reservoir of discussion. \n Note also brooch (“a piece of jewellery”), pronounced exactly like broach. The two words come from the same French source and were spelled alike until about 1600."

		"title": "Breathalyzer or breathalyser",
		"explanation":"The trademark Breathalyzer dates from the 1960s, and in North American usage the word is still capitalized more often than not. In data from CCAE the upper-case form (as in Breathalyzer test) outnumbers the lower-case one by more than 2:1, though the verb breathalyze is accepted without a capital letter. Elsewhere both noun and verb appear freely in lower case. In the UK the spelling breathalyser is used from the first Oxford Dictionary (1989) citation, and this dominates in BNC data, along with breathalyse for the verb. The lower-case spellings with -yse also prevail in Australia, according to the Macquarie Dictionary (1997). For those conscious that analyse is blended into the latter part of the word, -yse(r) seems preferable, but there are counter arguments. See analyze or analyse."

		"title": "briar or brier",
		"explanation":"Two different shrubs may be indicated by these two spellings, but they have never been distinguished by them. Both briar and brier have been used for: \n (1) the wild rose and the thorny bush that bears it (2) \n white heath Brier is the older spelling for the wild rose, originally Old English but challenged by the variant briar from C16 on. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) puts brier first, while noting briar as “now more common.” The two spellings appear in the same order for the white heath from southern France, first mentioned in the later C19. Webster’s Third (1986) also makes brier the primary spelling for both plants. Yet briar is strongly preferred in both British and American databases, outnumbering brier by more than 3:1 in the BNC and 6:1 in CCAE. Briar is used whether it’s a simple reference to the plant, or caught up in compounds such as briar patch (full of thorn bushes), or briar pipe (made from the root of the white heath). Placenames real and fictional (the Briar Patch of Joel Harris’s “Uncle Remus” stories) have probably reinforced the use of briar."

		"title": "Britain, British, Briton, Britisher and Brit",
		"explanation":"The term Britain is familiar shorthand for Great Britain, the island which geographically contains England, Wales and Scotland; or else the United Kingdom, a political entity comprising Great Britain and Northern Ireland (see UK); or else the British Isles, including Great Britain, the whole of Ireland, and all the offshore islands. \n The adjective British is used in reference to many aspects of the culture of Great Britain, yet there’s no straightforward general term for its inhabitants. Britisher is an Americanism which the British do not warm to, and Americans themselves make relatively litte use of it, by the evidence of CCAE. The abbreviation Brit has gained popularity since World War II, though it seems to be more freely used in the US than the UK. In BNC data it mostly appears in newspaper headlines, and in breezy reporting on sport and popular music. But American writers use it in a wider variety of contexts, and in more discursive writing – witness examples from CCAE such as a founding sister of Brit feminism and a Brit’s eye view of American youth. Such uses on both sides of the Atlantic show that it has shed the disparaging overtones once attributed to it. \n Briton has advantages over both Britisher and Brit. In spite of historical overtones, it seems to be regaining ground as a general appellation, and is almost twice as frequent as Brit in both CCAE and BNC. It doesn’t smack of headlinese, and is not restricted to sports / pop music reporting. Yet the identification of an individual Briton is still very much associated with journalism in the BNC, as in A Briton will command and direct NATO troops or the first Briton to climb Everest without oxygen. The plural Britons does however appear in a wider range of nonfiction writing. \n None of the British labels (Britisher, Brit, Briton) are relished by the non-English inhabitants of UK, who naturally prefer to be identified as Welsh, Scottish, Irish (see further under Ireland and Irish). In using those more specific names, as well as English, there are gains in precision for all."

		"title": "British English",
		"explanation":"The expression British English is generally used to distinguish the standard form of English used in Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the varieties used in other parts of the world. British pronunciations as shown in most dictionaries are in fact those associated with southern and eastern dialects (and with speakers from the middle and upper classes). The grammar and core vocabulary of “standard English” are also from southeastern England, yet they are the staple of written English from anywhere in the UK – if it aims to reach readers beyond its place of origin. The term British English as used in this book refers to the common written language, which through various media and styles communicates to a wide reading public. \n Contemporary British English is not of course the same as the pre-standardized variety of English that crossed to America from 1600 on, or the mix of dialects that was transported to colonies in other parts of the world in C18 and C19. (See under American English, Australian English, Canadian English, New Zealand English, for the particular dialects concerned.) British English has itself evolved during the last four centuries. The pre-Renaissance vernacular was expanded with thousands of classical loanwords, often in alternative forms (e.g. barbarian/barbaric/ barbarous; tragic/tragical). Cultural connections with France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands fostered the adoption of words from modern European languages, from ballet to bullet, scherzo to stiletto. The huge volume of borrowings also supplied the formative elements for neo-classical terms – combining forms such as electro-/geo-/hydroand -graphy/-logy/-lysis. It prompted some fine-tuning of the appearance of English words (see for example the entries on check and quay, and spelling section 1). The interplay between classical and French models for spelling is still with us in alternatives such as -or/-our and -ize/-ise. \n The characteristic written features of British English owe much to C18 and C19 linguistic movements, which were not felt so strongly elsewhere. A plethora of grammars and dictionaries appeared to fill the void left by unsuccessful attempts to establish an English language academy in C17 and C18 (see language academy). Some of these publications held more authority than others, most notably Samuel Johnson’s A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), reprinted with very few changes for 75 years, and Lindley Murray’s A Grammar adapted to different Classes of Learners (1795). They symbolize the collective desire to codify the language and put bounds on unruly variation. \n The industrial revolution stimulated scientific inquiry on all fronts, including the English language, and the Oxford English Dictionary (published 1884–1928) is a monument to it. Its Scottish-born editor, James Murray, inspired the collection of 1.8 million citations of English usage, to provide a history of the English lexicon century by century from the Norman Conquest on. In keeping with its historical stance, the dictionary is strictly descriptive and avoids judgements about style or usage which would be at risk of anachronism (see further under descriptive or prescriptive). Work on the dictionary began more than two decades before the publication of the first volume. In its shadow, controversy raged over what was or was not good English. The Dean of Canterbury (Henry Alford) published his “Plea for the Queen’s English” in 1863, which drew a fierce critique titled “The Dean’s English” (1864) from Washington Moon, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The two jousted publicly over many points of usage, and Moon’s work, with excerpts from Alford, ran to several editions. The prescriptive tradition was thus maintained by individual authors through C19, and launched into C20 by The King’s English (1906) compiled by the brothers Fowler. The Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926) by H. W. Fowler is likewise famous for its stoutly worded prescriptions, though they are mitigated by extensive use of citations. This gives “Fowler” more weight than his imitators, and successive reprintings of his work into C21 have kept his judgements in circulation. His influence is stronger in the UK than elsewhere (Peters and Delbridge, 1997) in terms of detail. But his use of the word usage has been claimed in the titles of works on American, Canadian and Australian English. \n  The grammar of British English owes much to the work of European scholars, most notably Otto Jespersen, whose A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles (7 vols. 1909–49) is in the descriptive tradition of the Oxford Dictionary. The Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language (1985) distinguishes British from American grammatical usage from time to time, using data from the Survey of English Usage begun in 1959 at University College London. The Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (1999) makes systematic use of database evidence to describe common usage, to show how it varies in different genres of writing, and to contrast British and American patterns of speech. \n Against this backdrop of description and prescription, written British English remains in some ways more pluralistic than other varieties, for example in allowing -t as well as -ed for the past tense of verbs such as leap. It tolerates both -ize and -ise, -able and -eable, where North American English prefers the first in each case. It embraces more exceptions to the general spelling rules, as in the exemption of l from the spelling conventions associated with final consonants (see doubling of final consonant). In punctuation the British conventions often create subcategories of style which are not observed elsewhere, e.g. in punctuating abbreviations (see contractions section 1); and the positioning of stops relative to quote marks (see quotation marks section 3). Yet typically one or other British convention overlaps with the American, providing common ground for “international English.”"

		"title": "British National Corpus (BNC)",
		"explanation":"A most important source on contemporary British usage is the British National Corpus (BNC). Compiled in the early 1990s, the database consists of over 100 million words from 4124 texts in computerized form. It includes 10 million words of (transcribed) spoken British English and 90 million words of printed or written material, of which 75% is nonfiction and 25% imaginative or creative prose. The written material was published from 1975 on, apart from a small number of slightly earlier fictional texts, which were included on grounds of their continuing popularity. The range of genres and audiences included is large and diverse, from mass-circulating newspapers and magazines and monographs by major publishers to the products of small local presses, as well as e-mail and scripts and autocues for television. The spoken data was collected from the contexts of business, education, religion and politics, as well as radio phone-ins and the everyday conversation of citizens from 4 socio-economic groups in 38 different locations throughout Britain. \n With this wide range of computerized source material, the BNC provides empirical and quantifiable evidence on current usage. It shows what is common English idiom, used in many genres of communication, as well as which forms of expression are relatively uncommon – either older ones becoming obsolescent or totally new arrivals. Usage can be correlated with particular corpus genres, such as journalism or academic prose, and with broader communicative styles, such as the formal or the interactive. The BNC represents the current state of the language comprehensively. It avoids the problems of bias and selective taste that are inherent in the comments of individuals and committees on usage. \n The BNC was compiled by a consortium involving major publishers: Oxford University Press, Longman (now Pearson Education) and Chambers (now Chambers Harrap), as well as Oxford University Computing Services, the Lancaster University Centre for Computational Research on the English Language, and the British Library Research and Innovation Centre. Collateral funding was provided through the Department of Trade and Industry, under the Joint Framework for Information Technology, the Science and Engineering Council and the British Academy.

Samuel Johnson threw his weight behind broken with the comment that “a distinct past participle is more proper and elegant.” Johnson’s censure seems to have cast a long shadow over broke even in this specialized sense as a paraphrase for “bankrupt”; and British usage commentators are still inclined to dub it “informal” or “slang.” While broke (“bankrupt”) hardly appears in the BNC, it makes a modest showing in CCAE and seems to belong to standard American usage, as noted by Webster’s English Usage (1989). \n ♦ Compare gone bust, under bust."

Surprisingly perhaps, the instances of brunet were almost all references to women, in examples like catty brunet, the now-brunet Madonna, and there was scant evidence of its being the “male” counterpart to brunette. For some American writers, it seems that brunet is simply a shorter equivalent to brunette, to be used just as one might prefer omelet to omelette (see further under -ette). \n In both CCAE and BNC, brunette is almost always a noun.

		"title": "bug",
		"explanation":"For Americans bug is a household word, with several applications developed over the last 150 years. Few would question their stylistic status, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). The British also make good use of bug, with hundreds of examples in the BNC. It lends itself to casual discussion of things that upset the equilibrium of body, mind or machine – which works against it on the scale of stylistic precision. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) and New Oxford (1998) query some uses of bug with the labels “slang” and “informal,” though all can be found across a range of spoken and everyday written texts in the BNC. In formal discourse the word might still seem out of place, but it’s otherwise well assimilated. \n  In current usage, bug can refer to: \n 1. an insect \n  2. a surveillance device \n  3. a germ or infection \n 4. an enthusiasm \n 5. a computer problem \n Attached to the first three senses are verbs, whose stylistic status in British English is much like that of the noun, as discussed below. \n 1 bug “insect.” This is the oldest sense, recorded since C17, and standard in the US for any kind of six-legged creature, and so it naturally appears in compounds such as bug repellent, and also in more specific names such as bedbug, ladybug, June bug. The generic use of the word is labeled “dialect or US” in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), but becomes the primary sense in New Oxford (1998), with no restrictive labels. Its increasingly standard use in the UK is confirmed in BNC citations such as bug spray and water placed around the room to attract the bugs. The use of the adjective bug-eyed “(with bulging eyes [like an insect])” – listed without comment in New Oxford – also suggests that the British are not unfamiliar with the generic use of bug. However there’s little sign in the UK of the American verb bug out, used of eyes that “stand out on stalks,” as in: \n He clasped his head and his eyes bugged out. \n 2 bug “a microphone concealed for surveillance.” As a noun this was first recorded after World War II (1947). It must have been around earlier, by the fact that it was already on record as a verb (meaning “plant a surveillance device”) at the end of World War I. Webster’s English Usage affirms that these uses of bug are standard American idiom, and they are listed without restrictive labels by New Oxford, where the Oxford Dictionary labeled them “slang.” Both noun and verb are well represented in the British and American databases. Bugging can be carried out within buildings, on vehicles or a telephone line: \n . . . harassed by the KGB. My telephone and apartment are bugged. \n In keeping with the secretive process, bugging is usually expressed in the passive. The further reaches of the word are the political campaign bugged and parties bugged for blackmail. \n 3 bug ``germ/infection.” Bug has been used to refer to an infection-causing micro-organism since 1919, according to the Oxford Dictionary. New Oxford labels it “informal,” and examples such as flu/stomach bug turn up more often in spoken than written data in the BNC. The related verb bug “annoy” as in it really bugged me is also associated with speech rather than writing. Webster’s English Usage notes that the noun has escaped censure in the US; and there’s no doubt that the verb is used more freely in print. It carries more shades of meaning, especially the sense “pester,” as in: \n : . . . the sort of side dish your mother always bugged you to finish \n In CCAE data, the scope for word play with bug (“insect”) is also enjoyed: \n Iowans bugged by pesky fruit flies \n . . . bugged by X’s gnat-picking \n 4 bug “enthusiasm.” Both Americans and the British use the noun bug to refer offhandedly or self-deprecatingly to an enthusiasm: the acting/ spring-cleaning bug or the motorcycle/triathlon bug. This again is “informal” according to New Oxford, but unobjectionable as far as Webster’s English Usage is concerned. In CCAE data it appears in the same kinds of prose as the other uses of bug. \n 5 bug “computer problem.” This most recent use of bug – to refer to a “gremlin” in the computer (an unexplained problem with software or hardware) – is accepted worldwide. It owes something to C19 use of bug to refer to a mechanical defect, but also seems to hark back to the ultimate origins of bug in a Celtic word for “ghost” or “devil.” (Compare boggle and bogey.) A connection with bug as “insect” can also be found, with the help of Ambrose Bierce’s (1906) definition of the fly as “a monster of the air owing allegiance to Beelzebub.” Though the Oxford Dictionary decided to keep bug meaning “ghost” separate from the other senses, they seem to have plenty in common. \n ♦ For the verbs bug off and bug out meaning “leave,” see under bugger."

		"title": "bugger",
		"explanation":"Like most words with taboo connections, bugger has a substantial history, going back to 1598, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and no doubt earlier. Its colloquial meanings are also well established. Bugger as a rough equivalent to “chap” dates from early C18, and this is still its most frequent use in contemporary written English, by the evidence of BNC and CCAE. It mostly appears in quoted speech, and always it’s rich in attitude. Its tone is offhanded, which often seems to intensify the reference, whether to persons: \n Some bugger is wearing it! \n Then you’re a sillier bugger than I thought. \n  I can’t keep up with the old bugger. \n Or to objects: \n a multipurpose little bugger (said of a word) \n  . . . lift the little gold bugger (of winning the World Cup) \n . . . gnawing little bugger at the back of my mind \n Bugger has a role in imprecations, paraphrasing damn. The verbal formula bugger it/him/her/them is on record from late C18, though the first recorded case of a bugger (as in no-one gives a bugger) is from C20. Other phrasal verbs including bugger off (“go away”) and bugger up (“make a mess of ”) are also C20 additions to the repertoire. Most recent are the curtailed forms bug off and bug out (“leave quickly”), which mask the key word lest it offend. Unabbreviated verb uses nevertheless appear quite freely in the spoken material from the BNC, and constitute about 40% of all instances of the word. In CCAE by contrast, there’s only small evidence of bugger as a noun, and hardly any as a verb, only Bugger it all. The evidence suggests that bugger is more freely used in the UK than the US, a conclusion also reached by Webster’s English Usage (1989), and by Burchfield (1996) on the basis of dictionary evidence. \n The word bugger is very occasionally an agent noun associated with the verb bug, meaning “one who plants/operates surveillance devices,” or the device itself. See bug section 2."

		"explanation":"These are the newest addition to the punctuation repertoire, though different in that they precede the strings of words that they mark off, rather than following them. Bullets differ also in taking on a variety of graphic shapes. They can be rendered as dashes or asterisks within the standard set of punctuation marks; or as small black circles, hollow circles, lozenges, arrows, stylized hands etc., as the software provides. \n The chief function of bullets is to itemize the components of a vertical list, when there’s no need for more specific enumeration with numbers or letters (see lists section 2). Because they highlight sets of information that can be scanned by the eye, they facilitate reading on screen, and are therefore recommended in the structure and styling of digital documents.

		"title": "bunch of",
		"explanation":"For some, the feel of this phrase depends on its complement. In a bunch of grapes/flowers or a bunch of keys, it’s quite neutral and stylistically unremarkable anywhere in the English-speaking world. In the US, bunch of is also a general collective, as in a bunch of colleges or (more figuratively) a bunch of ideas; and it’s freely applied to people. These seem to have developed during C20 and established themselves, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). Canadians also use them, but might find the application of bunch of to people somewhat “informal,” and/or derogatory, given the gloss “a group, a gang” in the Canadian Oxford (1998). New Oxford (1998) uses the same label (“informal”) for British English, yet it’s the disparaging aspect of bunch of which stands out of its appearances in the BNC. Whether “they” are a bunch of amateurs/second-raters or cocooned scientists, extremist Freemasons or individualistic head-in-the-sand poseurs – the writer has no time for them. Constructions like these are hardly colloquial or casual, and suggest that bunch of is less neutral in the UK than the US when applied to a group of people."

But the word predates the sport: as bungy it’s recorded in the 1930s as the term for the elasticized cord used in launching a glider, and for tying up bundles, the bulging suitcase etc. It shares its pronunciation and probably its past with bungie, a word for india rubber, which could well be Hindi. The Indian connection might explain why bungee is now the most popular spelling: compare suttee, and see -ee."

Still burglarize is very much the American choice, outnumbering burgle by almost 20:1 in CCAE. But burglarize has no support in the UK, and is absent from the BNC. Instead burgle serves the purpose, and examples appear in a variety of British sources. For both speakers and writers, burgle projects the meaning of “break and enter” more efficiently than the legal phrase, and it’s indispensable when (as usually) a passive construction is needed: \n In 1990 nearly a million homes were burgled. Burgle seems to have surmounted the hurdle of being a backformation (see further under that heading)."

An internet search (Google, 2003) confirms that burka is the commonest spelling worldwide, outnumbering burqa by 5:3, and burkha by 7:1.

		"title": "burned or burnt",
		"explanation":"These alternative past forms of burn raise questions. Are they interchangeable, or is there some crucial distinction? American English uses burned regularly within the verb phrase, and overall in more than 85% of examples in CCAE. Burnt is reserved for special attributive uses as in burnt cork, burnt almond, and burnt-out, used of vehicles and buildings as well as persons. \n In British English, the two are about equally used. Burned has a very slight edge over burnt (53% to 46%), which goes with the fact that burnt can appear in ordinary verb constructions such as Their fire burnt low and The house was burnt down. The use of burnt is sustained partly by its being often pronounced with “t,” according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985), though this is unprovable. Others explain the choice of burned or burnt as depending on the grammar of the verb: \n ∗ burned = continuous action (i.e. imperfect); burnt = completed (perfect) The fire burned low v. \n The fire had burnt through acres of forest \n ∗ burned = intransitive; burnt = transitive \n The fire burned low v. She burnt her hand on the stove \n ∗ burned = active; burnt = passive \n The fire had burned through v. Her hand had been burnt \n Because these principles overlap, they produce conflicting outcomes. This problem – and/or the lack of grammar – would explain why burned and burnt seem to be used interchangeably in BNC data. Compare the intransitive uses in: \n   The flame burnt steadily towards the light \n Lights still burned in the bookshop. That said, the data show British writers to be generally more inclined towards burned for the simple past (the spirit burned her throat), whereas they use burned and burnt about equally for the past participle. Like their American counterparts, they do prefer burnt for attributive uses as in burnt toast. \n International English selections: Against divergent practices, it makes sense to standardize on the regular form burned for the past tense and participle of the verb, rather than assuming that any systematic or meaningful distinction can be made with the two spellings. For the adjective, burnt is clearly supported worldwide. \n ♦ For other verbs with the same alternative past forms, see -ed."

But what about the inflected forms of bus as a verb: should they be buses (bused, busing), or busses (bussed, bussing)? Larger dictionaries present them as alternatives, in that order, yet database evidence suggests opposite trends in the US and the UK. The British preference for double s spellings is clear in BNC data, with twice as many examples of bussed as of bused. But in American data from CCAE, instances of bused outnumber bussed by about 8:1. In Canada, bused and busing are also the usual spellings, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). The forms with double s are more regular for a single-syllabled verb of this kind (see further under doubling of final consonant). The American preference for single s may however reflect the influence of the noun bus, and/or the need to distinguish the verb bus from the colloquial word buss (“kiss”). Thus when a president bussed his photograph, there’s no doubt about what actually happened!"

		"title": "bust and busted",
		"explanation":"The verb bust has no connection with an identical noun bust referring to the upper portion of a person’s anatomy. Rather bust(ed) has split off from the verb burst, and developed its own identity and meanings. It has acquired a regular past tense busted alongside the zero past tense bust: compare busted an arm with bust their way in. Bust is then a synonym for break/broke/broken, and it supports an array of more figurative meanings, as when its object is a union or “infrastructure.” In other collocations the object implies being caught red-handed as in cadets busted for cheating or busted for possession of illegal substances. Other examples in CCAE show busted meaning “framed” (i.e. charged with a crime one didn’t commit). The hundreds of examples of busted in CCAE confirm its widespread use in the US, in line with its rising status (Webster’s English Usage, 1989). In British English, busted is used in much the same ways as in the US, to mean “broken,” as in wheezing like a busted old fan, and “raided by police,” as in the party was busted by the Vice Squad. The BNC’s examples come from everyday writing or speech, confirming that such usage is still “informal,” as noted by New Oxford (1998). However Burchfield (1996) found the expression busted his leg “entirely neutral.” The status of busted in British English is clearly changing from “nonstandard,” as it was dubbed by the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). \n The use of bust in gone bust “gone bankrupt” is quite well represented in BNC data from both reported conversation and financial comments intended for nonspecialists. It appears more frequently in the British database than the American, although CCAE data have it in a wider range of applications, beyond the strictly financial to marriages and ideas. \n ♦ Compare broke."

		"title": "but",
		"explanation":"The fact that but is a conjunction does not prevent it from being used at the beginning of a sentence. The point is that it then becomes a conjunct (see conjunctions and conjuncts section 1). Generations of young writers have been taught not to begin sentences with but, yet their professional counterparts seem relatively unconcerned. More than 20% of the uses of but in the BNC were sentence-initial, not including those from transcripts of speech. In conversation but is quite often heard at the beginning of an utterance as the speaker alerts listeners to an imminent change of tack in the topic under discussion. Signaling this to one’s audience (or readers) may be vital, if they are to follow new developments in an argument. Still it is counterproductive to use but or any other discourse marker repeatedly (see further under that heading.) For alternative devices that express contrast, see conjunctions section 3."

		"title": "by, by-, bye- and bye",
		"explanation":"The English particle by appears as a prefix meaning “near to” or “beside” in words like: \n bypass byroad bystander byway \n It appears with the less physical meaning “associated with” or “derivative from” in others such as: \n byname byplay byproduct byword \n The trend is to set these words solid, though dictionaries differ as to which particular words from the second set are still to be hyphenated. All give a hyphen to the most recent word of this type by(-)line (“indication of authorship at the head of a newspaper article”), although those in the newspaper business are less inclined to do so. The fact that the word is increasingly used as a verb bylined is another factor that fosters the set-solid form. \n When it comes to by(e)law, you may choose between by and bye. The spelling with bye hints at the word’s history in Old Norse byr meaning “town”; while by looks like a reinterpretation of the first syllable as the English prefix by-. North American dictionaries prefer bylaw set solid, and this is the dominant form in American English, judging from CCAE data. New Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) prefer by-law, although actual usage is more variable. Data from the BNC yields examples of bylaw, by-law, byelaw and bye-law, among which the last was the most frequent. The instances of bye-law were mostly embedded in juridical statements and legal reports, whereas byelaw and by-law were more frequent in nonlegal writing. Bylaw appeared only a handful of times. \n By(e)-election is allowed the same options as by(e)(-)law by some, though it really is based on the prefix by-, and there’s no historical justification for bye-. In BNC data, by-election is the commonest form by far, with hundreds of examples whereas byelection and bye-election had less than a score each. By-election is the only spelling in American data from CCAE. \n By/bye also appears in a few places as an independent noun. In Canada, Australia and the UK, it’s used in various sports for the round in a competition when a team is conceded a pass, because of the lack of a competitor. In cricket a bye or leg bye is a run gained on the side, i.e. not from contact between bat and ball. In by the bye, bye is again a noun meaning “something aside,” though it’s often written as by the by, as if it had something in common with by and by (which is correctly written with two bys). Note also the informal bye-bye, a telescoping of “(God) be with you,” said twice over. \n ♦ Contrast the English prefix by- with the Latin bi-, discussed under bi-."

		"explanation":"The computer term byte was coined in the 1960s as a companion to bit – not any small piece but a blend of “binary digit,” i.e. a unit of computerized information, coded as 1 or 0. A byte equals 8 bits in most operating systems. With the rapid growth of computer capacity, kilobytes have given way to megabytes, gigabytes etc., yet being based on a binary system, the computer terms don’t match up exactly with those of the SI system, whose decimal prefixes they use (see Appendix IV). To distinguish the two, a fresh set of symbols and names embodying bi was established in 1998 by the International Electrotechnical Commission, associated with NIST (National Institute for Science and Technology). These are shown in the table below, and contrasted with the values of the common terms with their metric prefixes. \n 1 kibibyte kibi Ki 210 bits = 1024 bits \n 1 mebibyte mebi Mi 220 B = 1,048,576 B (1 megabyte = 1,000,000 B) \n 1 gibibyte gibi Gi 230 B = 1,073,741,824 B (I gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 B) \n The symbol B for bytes is standard; however, there’s a plethora of existing symbols for the megabyte, originating from different manufacturers (see megabyte). \n As visual and sound information converge, the megabyte of information is more easily confused with the soundbite beloved of radio broadcasters, which gives a punchline. The bite of soundbite is directly related to the common verb (“sink your teeth into”)."

		"title": "-c/-ck",
		"explanation":"English spelling sometimes demands that we double the last letter of a word before adding -ed, -ing and other suffixes (see under doubling of final consonant). Normally this means repeating the letter, as with beg > begged etc., but when the last letter is c, it’s “doubled” by making it ck. See for example: \n bivouac bivouacked bivouacking bivouacker \n  frolic frolicked frolicking frolicker \n mimic mimicked mimicking mimicker \n panic panicked panicking panicker \n picnic picnicked picnicking picnicker \n traffic trafficked trafficking trafficker \n The same happens when -y is added, witness panicky and colicky. This special treatment for a final c is necessary to ensure that it keeps its “k” sound before the suffix. When followed by e, i or y, a c usually sounds as “s,” as in racer, racing and racy (see -ce/-ge). \n Adding the k into panicked etc. looks strange partly because the inflected forms are much less used than the simple form panic. A variable k is also somewhat unusual. Much more often it’s fixed into the spelling, as in thousands of words like deck, derrick and rickshaw, not to mention kite, knee, leek, plankton. In fact khas come and gone from some of the words listed above: spellings such as logick, musick and physick were used in early modern English (up to C18), until it was felt that the k in them was superfluous. But the k reappears before the suffix in panicked and the rest, like a ghost from the past. \n Some technical words ending in c are exceptions, and do not add in a k before suffixes beginning with e or i. Engineers and scientists prefer arced/arcing to arcked/arcking. Technical words derived from zinc are written zincic, zinciferous, zincify and zincite. The less technical zincky follows the general rule. \n ♦ For the inflected forms of sync, talc and tarmac, see individual headings."

The spellings with one b are in line with antecedents in medieval French and Latin (and other related words such as cabal). Those with two bs reflect the spelling of the Hebrew original, although other adjustments as in qabbalah are needed to hebraicize it fully.

Caddie is more usual and given preference over caddy in the major British and American dictionaries – at least for the noun. For the verb the Oxford Dictionary (1989) has caddy as the preferred spelling, and its use is illustrated in several BNC examples, such as arranged for him to caddy at the LC Club. Webster’s Third (1986) keeps caddie as the primary spelling for both verb and noun. \n The word is believed to have come from Scottish English in C19.

		"title": "Caesarean, Caesarian, Cesarean or Cesarian",
		"explanation":"Add in the choice between capitalized and uncapitalized forms of the word, and you have eight possible spellings. Yet database evidence from the US and the UK shows that forms with capitals are a good deal more common than those without. Historical uses of the word are almost always capitalized; whereas references to the obstetrical procedure are lower-cased occasionally in CCAE, and quite often in BNC data (caesarean/caesarian appeared in more than 50% of instances of the word). \n Given the choice between ae and just e in the first syllable, historians everywhere use the first. The adjective Caesarean/Caesarian is tied to the name Caesar, and so keeps the classical ae spelling even in the US (see further under ae/e). When referring to obstetrics, British writers maintain the ae in both general and medical publications. Americans writing for a general audience tend to do the same, though the medical preference for cesarean shows up occasionally in data from CCAE. \n The choice between -ean and -ian is relatively clear cut, and both British and American writers tend to use -ean in Caesarean (cesarean) section. In CCAE data spellings with -ean outnumber those with -ian by more than 15:1. The two are more equally represented in the BNC, though Caesarean has the edge (4:3) in terms of the number of texts in which it appears. Among historians however the preferred spelling seems to be Caesarian. \n Despite the careful maintenance of Julius Caesar’s name in the spelling of the obstetrical procedure, it seems very unlikely that he himself was born by C(a)esarean section – as legend has it. Only in the last hundred years have surgical births become a regular procedure, and safe enough to ensure the survival of both mother and child. In earlier times surgical deliveries like this were indeed performed, but only to release an unborn child from a dying mother. Julius Caesar’s mother bore two more children after him, so she can scarcely have had a C(a)esarean performed on her. The tradition probably arose from the fact that the name Caesar seems to embody the Latin stem caesmeaning “cut.” The name was however borne by several of Julius Caesar’s ancestors.

Yet there may still be some cachet in the foreign accent, whether or not the place serves haute cuisine. The phrases referring to what you drink at a cafe, e.g. cafe au lait ´ or cafe-filtre ´ , often carry the acute accent.

In practice the adjective callous gets used figuratively, in the sense of “having a thick skin,” i.e. hard-hearted or brutal, witness callous murder or callous dismantling of the welfare state. Amid scores of examples in the BNC, the figurative sense dominates. \n All this explains the need for the adjectival derivative calloused, which in BNC data almost always expresses physical hardening of the skin, as in a big, strong hand, roughly calloused from field work. It presupposes a verb “to make or become callous” which is registered in both the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986), though it appears only as past and present participle. The spelling callused is much rarer and implies a derivation directly from the noun (see further under -ed section 2).

In a similar way, circumstances would decide whether in It can make things hard for you can expresses ability or possibility. In written discourse can is less equivocal, and only rarely expresses permission in academic prose, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). The Grammar shows that academic writers commonly use can to express ability as well as logical possibility – just like may. Can and may have similar frequencies overall in academic writing, whereas in other kinds of discourse (written and spoken) can is very much more common. \n The most common use of may nowadays is to express the sense of possibility, as in It may decide the future.

Compare statements such as: \n  You may go if you wish. \n You can go if you wish. \n And the requests: \n May I open the window? \n Can I open the window? \n The higher level of politeness and deference in may is a commonplace of usage books, often made categorical and without reference to its other grammatical functions. Data from the Longman corpus show that may is relatively rare in conversation, where it’s outnumbered by can more than 20 times over. This, and the fact that may is now strongly associated with academic writing, support the feeling that it expresses things more formally. \n ♦ See further under could or might; may or might; and under modality."

		"title": "Canadian English",
		"explanation":"Outside North America, Canadians are sometimes mistaken for Americans, but the Canadian variety of English is its own unique blend of British and American English. The foundations were laid by American Loyalists in C18, who moved into Canada from the eastern seaboard of the US, and were subsequently joined in C19 by new immigrants from Britain, especially Scotland. The Canadian English vocabulary includes loanwords from Canadian Indians, such as caribou, kayak, toboggan and totem, which have become part of English worldwide. The same goes for certain French words such as anglophone, francophone, which were first assimilated into English in Canada through contact with French speakers in Quebec. From east to west in Canada, there are considerable differences in vocabulary; and regional dictionaries of provincial vocabulary, such as that of Newfoundland English (1984) and of Prince Edward Island English (1988) appeared before any comprehensive national dictionary such as the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (1998). \n When written or printed, Canadian English varies in the extent to which it reflects American or British usage. Generally speaking, newspapers and magazines use American spellings such as color, center and anemic, in line with the Canadian Press Stylebook; whereas Canadian book publishers tend to use the British alternatives (colour, centre, anaemic etc.). Research by Ireland (1979) highlighted some regional differences, in that those resident in Ontario were more likely to use -our spellings than those in the provinces east or west of them. The punctuation of Canadian English again shows both American and British tendencies, but American practices prevail in the preference for double quote marks in many book publishers, as well as newspapers and magazines. Notable exceptions are the University of Toronto Press and the Canadian branches of Macmillan and Oxford University Press, which all prefer British style. In the absence of a specifically Canadian style guide, Canadian editors work with British or American style according to the task and its intended readers, as is clear from Editing Canadian English (2000). \n  A large endowment to support and promote standard Canadian English was vested by J.R. Strathy in the Strathy Language Unit, established in 1981 at Queen’s University, Kingston Ontario. The Strathy Corpus of Canadian English was planned and developed there by the Unit’s first directors (W.C. Lougheed, followed by M. Fee); and the corpus provided extensive data for the Canadian Guide to English Usage (1997)."

		"title": "candelabra",
		"explanation":"By origin candelabra is a Latin plural, like bacteria and data, and so its Latin singular is candelabrum. But candelabrum is not much used in contemporary English, judging by its low frequency in British and American databases; and its role as singular is often subsumed by candelabra, as in a massive candelabra or just a candelabra. This singular use of candelabra is noted in all regional dictionaries, American, Canadian, British and Australian, without censure except in New Oxford (1998). Of course candelabra also serves as plural (a pair of candelabra, matching candelabra), and in many contexts where its grammar is indeterminate, as in the title Behind the candelabra: my life with Liberace. Plural uses of candelabra (and instances of candelabrum) occur in writing concerned with antiques or ceremonial uses of the branching candlestick. Meanwhile the unmistakably singular use tends to turn up in narrative contexts, where the candelabra is a token of showiness or showmanship. In botanical names such as candelabra primula, candelabra tree (Euphorbia ingenuus), candelabra again seems to be singular. \n Current uses of candelabra thus tend to mask its plural identity, so it’s not unnatural to take it as singular and then create an English plural for it: candelabras. Though candelabras is frowned on by some, bothWebster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) acknowledge it, as well as candelabrums. Contemporary databases provide no support for candelabrums, but candelabras is clearly in use in both the US and the UK. If it matters that there was more than one branching candlestick to light the room, candelabras says it."

Webster’s Third (1986) labels candidature as “chiefly Brit.,” suggesting that Americans are more accustomed to candidacy, and evidence from CCAE bears this out, with examples of candidacy by the thousand, and only one of candidature. In Britain both words are current, but candidacy is again more common than candidature, outnumbering it by more than 2:1 in data from the BNC. In many contexts the two words seem to be interchangeable, whether they involve candidates for political parties, for local government or for head of state. Perhaps the only context in which candidature prevails is that of academic qualifications, where Ph.D. candidature etc. seems to be conventional."

		"title": "cannon or canon",
		"explanation":"What’s in a letter? In these divergent words, guns and missiles contrast with the laws and standards of the Church. \n The spelling cannon is reserved for a large gun, formerly mounted on a carriage, and for the shot fired by it (the cannon ball). It also refers to particular shots made in billiards and croquet. \n Canon is the spelling for two kinds of meaning, both originally associated with the Church: \n ∗ for a member of a religious group living under canon law, or a clergyman attached to a cathedral \n ∗ for the body of laws associated with a church, or other formulated practices, as in the canon of the Mass. Outside the Church it has come to mean any law or standard, or a reference list of items which are deemed authentic, e.g. the canon of Shakespeare plays. The canon of saints comprises those officially recognized by the Catholic Church. \n Both aspects of canon go back to a Latin word meaning “rule or measuring line.” Ultimately it was the Greek kanon, a derivative of kan(n)e meaning “a rod or reed.” This, strangely enough, is also the ultimate source of cannon. The hollowness of the reed and its usefulness as a firing tube gave rise to cannon, whereas the straightness of the rod is the semantic basis of canon. Other words derived from the same Greek source are the English cane and Italian cannelloni."

		"title": "cantaloupe, cantaloup, cantalope or cantelope",
		"explanation":"In references to this freshly luscious melon, the first spelling dominates citations from both British and American databases, and it’s rightly given preference in major dictionaries. Yet all highlight the second as an alternative (not in the databases); and the third and fourth, noted in Webster’s Third (1986) as well as the Oxford Dictionary (1989), connect with a not uncommon pronunciation which rhymes with antelope, and creates a spurious etymology for an inscrutable word (see further under folk etymology). \n Cantaloupe in fact enshrines the name of a quite different animal. The origins of the word are in Cantalupo (“song of the wolf,”) the name of one of the Pope’s former estates near Rome on which the fruit (brought from Armenia) was first developed. This explains why the vowel of the middle syllable should be a rather than e, but leaves us with the option of French loup (“wolf ”) or the anglicized -loupe for the last syllable."

		"title": "canvas or canvass",
		"explanation":"Dictionaries give the spelling canvas to the noun referring to a heavy fabric with a variety of applications from art to camping; and canvass to the verb meaning “solicit votes or voting support,” and its associated noun. But the spelling distinction is only about a century old, and unabridged dictionaries such as Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) show that either spelling has been and is possible. Database evidence suggests that this interchange is uncommon in current British English, given that the BNC’s examples (e.g. paintings on oil and canvass) are mostly in transcriptions of speech. In American data from CCAE it’s a little more common, and the interchange goes both ways: compare translating vision to canvass with a canvas of investment opportunities. As the second example shows, the noun canvas(s) is freely used in the US of investigations or surveys that have nothing to do with the electoral process. A canvass may or may not be carried out face to face, witness the telephone canvass, and can be associated with neighborhood detective work (the police canvass) or implementation of local regulations: a door-to-door canvass to confiscate home-grown fruit. In the UK canvass (as noun) is mostly associated with securing votes or surveying public attitudes, whereas the verb can also be used to mean “ascertain” (canvass the views of members) and “discuss” (canvassing the future), as in the US. \n The noun canvas comes from cannabis (“hemp”), and so a single s is all that etymology can justify. The verb canvass apparently derives from it, though authorities disagree on how. Dr. Johnson believed it originated in the practice of sifting flour through a piece of canvas, which is figuratively extended to the sifting through of ideas, one of the earliest recorded meanings. The Oxford Dictionary however relates canvass to canvas through a jolly practice alluded to by Shakespeare: that of tossing someone in a large canvas sheet, which could be figuratively extended to mean the public thrashing and airing of ideas. Yet neither explanation accounts for the sense of soliciting votes – the key to its most important modern uses. \n Spelled as canvass, the verb presents no problems when suffixes are added: canvassed, canvassing. As canvas it would raise the question as to whether to leave the s single as in canvased, canvasing. (See further under doubling of final consonant.) The plural of the noun canvas is simply canvases, on the analogy of atlas(es)."

Capacity to takes an infinitive, as in capacity to learn, capacity to muddle through, and it’s the most frequent of the three constructions in both the US and the UK, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. The alternatives capacity for and capacity of take a verbal noun (-ing form), as in capacity for getting around and capacity of evoking quieter forms of heroism. The construction with for is a good deal commoner than the one with of, especially in American data.

Note that the Australian federal parliament is housed on Capital Hill, within the ACT (Australian Capital Territory)"

		"title": "capital letters",
		"explanation":"These are so named because they “head” the beginning of a sentence, or a word or expression of special significance. (Capital embodies the Latin word caput, “head.”) Capital letters are larger than ordinary letters, and often different in shape – angular rather than rounded, as is evident in the differences between F and f, H and h, and M and m. Printers refer to them as “upper case” letters because they were stored in the upper section of the tray containing the units of typeface, while the ordinary letters (“lower case” letters) were kept in the lower and larger section of the tray. (For the use of small capital letters, see small caps.) \n Fewer initial capitals are now used in writing English than in earlier centuries. In C18 they were used not just for proper names, but also for any words of special note in a sentence, especially the noun or nouns under discussion. This practice survives to some extent in legal documents, which still use more capital letters than any other texts, partly perhaps to provide a focus for the reader in long legal sentences. Elsewhere the use of capitals has contracted to the items mentioned in the following sections (1a) to (1f). The use of capitals in abbreviated references (section 3) is more variable, as in the writing of book titles (see under titles; see also Bible). The gradual disappearance of capital letters from proper names which become generic words is discussed in section 2. \n Capital letters are a matter of regional difference. British writers and editors are more inclined to use capital letters where Americans would dispense with them. This divergence may well owe something to the fact that the original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) put a capital letter on every headword, whereas Webster’s Third (1986) has them all in lower case, and adds a note to say whether each is usually or often seen with a capital. The traditions thus established no doubt underlie the semantic and aesthetic values writers invest in capital letters, though logic doesn’t always support their conclusions. “When in doubt use lower case” is the pragmatic advice of the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors (1986). \n  Capitals for proper names \n a) The distinguishing names and designations given to a person are always given initial capitals. In some cases, e.g. Patience Strong, the capitals serve to confirm that the common words do indeed form a personal name, but most personal names (e.g. James Simpson) consist of elements that have no place in the common language. Capitals are used with names whether they are true given names, pseudonyms like Dorothy Dix, or nicknames such as the Iron Duke. The names of fictitious persons like John Doe and fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes are capitalized. Literary personifications (e.g. Truth) are also conventionally marked by their special capital letter: see personification. References to the Deity are regularly capitalized, and, in some ecclesiastical traditions, the attendant personal pronouns Him etc. as well. See further under God. \n Extra capital letters are often given in English to foreign names involving articles and prepositions, though they would not be capitalized in the language from which they come. So words like da, de, della, le, la, van and von quickly acquire capitals, as a glance at the telephone book would show. A Dutch personal name like van der Meer becomes Van Der Meer, and eventually Vandermeer. Celebrated names of this kind, such as da Vinci, de Gaulle, della Robbia and van Gogh, do resist this capitalization more strongly. Yet they too acquire a capital letter when used at the beginning of a sentence. On the use of one or two capital letters in names such as FitzGerald/ Fitzgerald and McLeod/Macleod, see under Fitz- and Mac. \n b) National and ethnic names are regularly capitalized, whether they refer to nations, races, tribes, or religious or linguistic groups. Hence: \n Altaic Aztec Caucasian \n Christian Danish Hausa \n Hindu Japanese Muslim \n Navaho Semitic Tartar \n Tongan Tutsi Ugric \n References to the Canadian First Nations and to Australian Aborigines and an Aboriginal people are always capitalized for this reason. See also black or Black and colo(u)red. \n c) The names of organizations and institutions are to be capitalized, whenever they are set out in full. (For abbreviated references, see below, section 3.) Most institutional names consist of a generic element e.g. department and another word or words that particularize it e.g. education; finance and administration. When cited in full, both generic and particularizing words are capitalized, but not any small function words linking them (prepositions, articles, conjunctions). See for example: \n The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \n Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs IBM Global Services \n Museum of Contemporary Art \n Printing and Allied Trades Union \n Returned Services League of Australia \n Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals \n The names of vehicles of transport are capitalized, whether they are brand names such as Boeing 747 or Ford Falcon, or unique names such as the Orient Express or HMS Dreadnought. Individual vehicle names are normally italicized as well. \n d) Official titles and offices are capitalized whenever they are used to name a particular holder or incumbent, e.g. \n Cardinal Newman \n Chancellor Kohl \n Lieutenant James Varley \n Lord Denning \n President Ronald Reagan \n Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \n Senator John Harridene \n When the title or office is used in apposition to the individual’s name, capitalization practices vary. American English is not inclined to capitalize, whether the title follows the name, or precedes it without being part of it: \n Fiorello La Guardia, mayor of New York \n the mayor of New York, La Guardia \n French president De Gaulle \n Charles De Gaulle, president of France \n In British English such titles carry capital letters when they come before the individual’s name, but not if they follow, according to Ritter (2002). So a reference to French President De Gaulle would be fully capitalized. Older British style put capitals on titles used on their own, as in the Bishop of London was in attendance (Hart’s Rules, 1983). But this is no longer necessary except to prevent ambiguity (Ritter); and Americans just would not, according to the Chicago Manual (2003). Neither would put a capital on generic or plural references to an office: when he became king; the prime ministers of England. British and American practices also coincide on using upper case / capitals in honorific titles and forms of address such as His Grace, Her Majesty, Your Excellency. \n Senior title- and office-holders in institutions other than church and state are not regularly capitalized. In newspapers and other general publications, references to chief executive officers in business and industry are typically lower-cased, as in: \n chairman of Kraft Foods \n  managing director of Reader’s Digest \n In-house company publications and prospectuses may nevertheless capitalize all references to their executives. \n e) Geographical names and designations are capitalized whenever they appear in full. In some cases this helps to distinguish them from phrases consisting of identical common words e.g. Snowy Mountains, Northwest Territory, but in most cases the capitals simply help to highlight unique placenames for countries and cities e.g. India, Delhi, as well as local and street names e.g. Park Avenue, Times Square. They are also used for individual topographical names such as the Mississippi River and the South Downs. The names of special buildings and public structures are also capitalized whenever they are given in full form, as with the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty. \n When two or more geographical names are combined in a single expression, the generic part of the names is usually pluralized and kept in lower case if it follows rather than precedes: the Hudson and Mississippi rivers \n the Atlantic and Southern oceans \n Cf. \n Mounts Egmont and Hutt \n This practice is established in many parts of the English-speaking world, and detailed in the CBE Manual (1994), the Australian government Style Manual (2002), and the Chicago Manual (2003). But whether the generic word precedes or follows in the official form of the name can be difficult to ascertain. (See further under geographical names section 1). \n Compass directions are capitalized when abbreviated – S, SW, SSW – but lower-cased when written out in full: south, southwest, southsouthwest. \n f ) References to unique historical events and periods are capitalized if they are the standard designation: \n Black Hole of Calcutta \n Bronze Age \n the Reformation \n Roaring Twenties \n World War II \n However ones which are paralleled in different places at different times do not need capitals: gold rush, industrial revolution. \n Special feast days, holidays and public events are given initial capitals: \n the Adelaide Festival \n Bay to Breakers \n Boxing Day \n  Fourth of July \n  Good Friday \n Yom Kippur \n While the regular names of days and months are capitalized (Saturday, September), those for less well-known points in the calendar are left in lower case: solstice, equinox. \n g) Scientific nomenclature for animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, viruses and diseases have a capital letter for the genus, but not for the species name: \n Larus pacificus \n Begonia semperflorens \n Both parts of the expression are normally italicized. However the common English names for flora and fauna are not capitalized or italicized, when they coincide with the genus name. Hence: \n acacia capsicum citrus \n herpes octopus pterodactyl \n (See further under scientific names.) \n Astronomical names for the stars, planets, asteroids etc. are capitalized: \n the Great Bear \n the Milky Way \n the Southern Cross \n However when the name consists of both a particular and a generic element e.g. the Crab nebula, only the particular part bears a capital. \n h) Commercial names, including trademarks, brandnames and proprietary references should be capitalized as long as their registration is current. Those which become household words steadily lose the initial capital – witness cellophane, escalator, nylon, thermos – and many a trademark has lapsed in the course of time. An added problem in international English is that a commodity such as aspirin is now free of trademark restrictions in the UK and the US, Australia and New Zealand, but not Canada. \n Dictionaries usually indicate when a particular word originated as a trademark, and their use of upper or lower case for the headword is some indication of their judgement on its current status as a proprietorial or generic item. Thus the Oxford Dictionary (1989) lists aqualung, jeep and caterpillar with lower case, but Frigidaire, Hoover and Levis with upper case, choices which seem to be largely based on the accompanying citations. This correlates with its disclaimer to the effect that there is no legal significance in the use or nonuse of a capital letter on such names. But Webster’s Third (1986) lists all such words with upper case (a departure from its standard practice for all other headwords), and thus presumably avoids litigation. Even large dictionaries are retrospective in their coverage, and cannot perhaps be expected to be up to date with the changing status of words coined as trademarks. The ultimate reference on their status is the registry of patents in each English-speaking country. (See further under trademarks.)  \n The proprietary names of drugs require a capital, whereas generic ones may be lower-cased. Thus hydrocortisone (Celestone-V). For general purposes, i.e. when not concerned with the trialing of a proprietary drug, the writer would naturally use generic names. For up-to-date information on non-proprietary names, consult the twice-yearly British National Formulary or the annual Dictionary of Drug Names of USAN (United States Adopted Names Council) and USPC (United States Pharmacopeial Convention). \n In computer terminology, the names of computer languages and proprietary programs and systems are usually given full caps: \n CD-ROM FORTRAN HTML \n JAVA PC UNIX \n This is in line with common practice for acronyms (see acronyms), though not all computer terms are strictly that, as the mix of examples shows. \n The names of newspapers, magazines and serials always bear initial capital letters: \n Christian Science Monitor \n Daily Telegraph \n English Today \n New Scientist \n The definite article/determiner (the) is not normally capitalized (or italicized) in such references. (See further under the section 4.) \n 2 When capital letters disappear from proper names. Since a capital letter marks the fact that a name is unique (or at least relatively so, in the case of “common” personal names such as Anne, James etc.), we might expect them to disappear when the name becomes the byword for something. This has certainly happened to words such as sandwich and wellington, where the meaning of the common noun is far removed from the person concerned. Eponymic words like those are most likely to be lower-cased when they take on a derivational suffix, as for example in machiavellian, pasteurize, spoonerism. (See further under eponyms and suffixes section 2.) \n  Capital letters disappear more slowly from geographical and national names which have become the byword for something. No doubt this is because the regular geographical/national use of the word (with a capital) is current, and some writers flinch at french polish (with lower case) because they are so accustomed to French exports. Dictionary makers are also reluctant to decapitalize such words because of the inconsistencies they seem to create in a column of compound expressions \n Yet Fowler (1926) and others since have recommended lower-casing expressions like french windows and venetian blinds, because the geographical/cultural connection is tenuous and scarcely felt. We might all agree to delete the capital letter in phrases such as dutch courage, french leave and chinese burn, which owe more to Anglo-Saxon prejudice than anything else (see further under throwaway terms). Many people would remove the capital from geographically named fruits and vegetables like brussels sprout, french bean, swiss chard, because they are grown all over the world. This was clear in responses to the Langscape survey (1998–2001), and the majority also resisted routine capitalization of alsatian and siamese. The names of animal breeds like these continue to be capitalized in publications produced by official breeder organizations, yet the trend away from capitals is evident in newspapers and books for the general market. Wine regulators encourage the use of capitals for grape varieties (but not for wine names), so that it should be Chardonnay, Riesling and Shiraz, but champagne, moselle and sauterne. Yet uncertainty in the general public about that distinction, and the unfamiliarity of the places embodied in some of the wine names, means that many people simply lower-case them all. The town names enshrined in the names of cheeses – cheddar, edam and stilton – are not universally known, and again most respondents to Langscape resisted capitalizing Stilton. Overall then capital letters tend to disappear from common nouns derived from place names, though the trend is retarded in certain contexts. \n 3 Capital letters in abbreviated designations and titles. After introducing a name or the title in full, most writers abbreviate it for subsequent appearances – it would be cumbersome otherwise. The word retained is often lower-cased. So the Amazon River becomes the river, Brigadier R. Sande becomes the brigadier, and the National Gallery becomes the gallery. The practice is set out in the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) and extensively illustrated in the Chicago Manual ch. 8. It was endorsed worldwide by a majority of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001). The use of lower case helps to show that it is not the official name/title, and avoids drawing unnecessary attention to it once it is a “given” rather than “new” item in the stream of information. (See further under given and new.) \n Some established abbreviations do nevertheless retain the capital: \n a) the Channel (for the English Channel); the Keys (for the Florida Keys); the Reef (for Great Barrier Reef ) \n b) abbreviated names of organizations continue to bear capitals when they consist of the particular, rather than the generic part of the name, as in a new look for Veterans Affairs; the budget for Health. \n c) many organizational names are abbreviated as an initialism or acronym in full caps: AMA, BBC, GATT, HMSO, NAACP \n  Other exceptions to the general principle are the tendency mentioned above in section 1d, to capitalize even abbreviated references to the chief executive roles, e.g. the Prime Minister, the Chancellor, and the tendency to retain capitals in in-house publications, when referring to company or organization personnel, e.g. the Human Resources Manager, the Directors. In British style the word Government often carries a capital letter even in shorthand references to a particular government (Ritter, 2002). But in American, Canadian and Australian style, government is lower-cased except when the word appears within the official title: see the Chicago Manual (2003), Editing Canadian English (2000) and the Australian government Style Manual (2002). The danger of overcapitalizing is noted in Copy-editing (1992), once exceptions begin to be admitted. \n 4 The use of mid-capitals (also called bicaps, incaps and intercaps). Some organizations and businesses go by compound names with a capital letter in the middle, e.g. AusInfo, HarperCollins. The mid-capital is thus part of their trademark or business identity, and it defies the general practice of using a hyphen before a capital letter in mid-word (see hyphens section 1c). The practice is established in personal names such as FitzGerald and McIvor: see under Fitz- and Mac or Mc. \n 5 Capital letters in crossreferences to chapters, figures, tables etc. Editorial practices vary over whether words such as chapter should carry an initial capital in textual references to other chapters, as in: \n See chapter 4 for further discussion. \n The contrasting data are presented in figures 6 and 7. \n  The Chicago Manual uses lower case whether the word is given in full, as in these examples, or abbreviated to ch., fig. etc. British authorities diverge: the Oxford Guide to Style (2000) has them in capitals, whereas Copy-editing (1992) explicitly allows either style – so long as it’s used consistently. Copy-editing notes that table is never abbreviated, and recommends against using the other abbreviations except in parentheses and footnotes. \n 6 The use of capital letters in book titles and other compositions. Capital letters may be used minimally, moderately or maximally in the titles of books and articles, as well as other published or broadcast works. See further under titles. \n ♦ For using capitals to mark individual letters as words, see letters as words. \n ♦ For making use of capitals for typographical effect, see under headings and subheadings (layout and typography)."

		"explanation":"Dictionaries present cappuccino as the standard spelling for Italian-style coffee made with a topping of frothy steamed milk, now fully assimilated in the English-speaking world. The phrase cappuccino cowboys makes its point in American cities. Cappuccino is the dominant spelling in data from CCAE and the BNC, yet the databases also contain a sprinkling of the variants capuccino and cappucino, in around 10% of all instances of the word. They can also be seen on menus and restaurant blackboards – evidence of the English tendency to drop a consonant or two from loanwords (see further under single for double). Cappuccino is the only legitimate spelling for those who wish to connect it with its origins in the Italian word cappuccio meaning “hood.” The hood gave a name to the Capuchin order of friars, a French form of the name, which again shows the loss of one of the two ps. \n There is another connection with the Capuchins, because the Capuchin friar (in Italian cappuccino) wore a chestnut-colored robe, whose hue was then called cappuccino, according to the Grande Dizionario della Lingua Italiana (1962). Thus cappuccino describes the color of the coffee beneath the foam – neither black nor white but brindle. \n In English the plural of cap(p)uc(c)ino is normally cappuccinos, though in an Italian ristorante or trattoria, it could well be cappuccini.

		"explanation":"Both carat and karat are used in assessing the value of gold, though the first is much more common than the second. In American English the two spellings sometimes correspond with different measures, carat being a unit of weight (about 200 milligrams), and karat a measure of its purity. (Pure gold is 24 karats.) Yet carat often serves for both, according to the major American dictionaries, and in Britain this is standard practice. The abbreviation for carat is ct. or car., and for karat it is kt. \n Both karat and carat seem to have developed from the same source, though neither comes very close to the Arabic qirat. Rather they reflect the mediating languages: Greek keration and Italian carato. Both meanings (weight, and purity) were current in C16 English, and the fact that the second one is sometimes spelled caract suggests that it may have developed under the influence of the Middle English word caracter, which was later used to mean both “sign, symbol” and “worth, value.” \n Different altogether is the word caret, a technical word used by editors and printers for the omission mark ∧.

The same compounds are nowadays christened with -ide."

		"title": "carcass or carcase",
		"explanation":"Dr. Johnson’s preference for the first spelling seems to be winning out. In the US carcass dominates in data from CCAE, and it’s the more popular of the two in BNC data, by more than 3:1. The Oxford Dictionary (1884-1928) noted that carcase was about as common as carcass in C19, but since then its use has declined. Canadians, like the Americans, prefer carcass, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998); whereas Australian usage is more mixed (Peters, 1995), like the British. \n Carcass is a C16 respelling of the word modeled on French carcasse (in Middle English it had been carcays or carkeis). Those earlier forms seem to be reflected in the spelling carcase, though the spelling of the second syllable could equally be folk etymology, an attempt to inject meaning into an opaque word (see further under folk etymology)."

New modes of transportation in C20 have seen the verb applied to other vehicles, so that cars, trucks, buses and planes can now careen, but the emphasis is on fast and uncontrolled movement: a hit-and-run driver careened into his car Careen can also be used figuratively, as in careened from one crisis to another. All these uses are at home in the US, by the evidence of CCAE. They are still quite rare in British data from the BNC, where the verb career serves much the same purpose: \n a fully-laden truck careered through the traffic lights \n . . . even as these thoughts careered through B’s troubled mind. \n British commentators have in the past been inclined to treat extended uses of careen as mistaken uses of career.

		"title": "cases",
		"explanation":"Nouns and pronouns play various roles in clauses, and their particular function in a given sentence is known as their case. Grammatical cases are in many languages associated with a particular ending or inflection. English nouns show it for the genitive or possessive, with the apostrophe “s,” as in: cat’s breakfast, today’s program. English pronouns adjust their forms for the accusative as well as the genitive: 7\n nominative I he she we they who \n accusative me him her us them whom \n genitive my his her our their whose \n Yet the nominative/accusative distinction for English pronouns is increasingly neutralized in certain contexts (see for example me, and whom) – which suggests evolution towards a “common case” (Wales, 1996). Case distinctions are much more visible in languages such as German, with its separate accusative and dative forms for many nouns. Latin had them for the ablative and vocative cases as well. (See further under accusative, ablative, dative and vocative.) Aboriginal languages in Canada and Australia use other cases which are rare in European languages, such as instrumental, locative and privative (expressing the lack of something). \n Because English nouns lack distinctive inflections for subject and object, traditional grammars identify their case in terms of their function relative to the verb or other constituents of the clause. So the subject noun (or noun phrase) is said to be in the nominative (or subjective) case, and the object noun / noun phrase to be accusative (or objective) in its case. The dative case would be found in a name or noun phrase that served as indirect object (see further under dative and object). \n  Modern English case grammar has stimulated fresh analysis of the system of cases, in terms of the so-called arguments of the verb and its valency. It allows (Cambridge Grammar of English, 2002) that verbs may take one or more arguments: \n  ∗ one argument \n (monovalent: subject only; = intransitive) they agreed \n ∗ two arguments \n (bivalent: subject + direct object; = monotransitive) they thanked him \n ∗ three arguments \n (trivalent: subject + indirect object + direct object : = ditransitive) they sent him a fresh proposal \n (See further under transitive.) Though the nomenclature varies, this approach helps to explain the flexible wording of English clauses, and the different roles of the grammatical subject for active and passive verbs: the active subject is typically the verb’s agent or senser, while the passive one is the verb’s goal (Halliday, 1994)."

		"title": "caster, castor or Castor",
		"explanation":"These spellings cover a range of meanings between them, and are interchangeable for some but not others. The spelling castor is standard when referring to (1) a particular type of fur hat, or (2) an oil used in making perfumes, both being associated with the beaver (in Greek kastor). The -or spelling also goes with castor oil extracted from the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis) or the castor bean as it’s called in the US and Canada. Castor-oil politics are of course analogous to medicinal use of the extract – and unpalatable, whatever their purgative value. \n The spelling caster derives from the English verb cast, and refers naturally enough to one who or that which casts. Both human and nonhuman applications are to be found in the context of fishing, since caster refers to the flycasting fisherman, as well as his choice of caster rather than maggot or worm as bait. A different kind of casting takes place when making movies or staging plays, but there again the role of caster is spelled so as to reflect its origins. \n In more remote applications of the word, caster varies with castor as the spelling for: \n 1 containers that dispense sugar, pepper or some other condiment \n 2 swiveling wheels attached underneath movable furniture \n 3 pivoting device connecting the axle of a vehicle with the front wheels \n In American data from CCAE, these senses are usually spelled caster, although Webster’s Third (1986) registers both spellings for them. In British English the spelling is often castor, judging by BNC evidence and dictionary variants, and the same is true in Australia and Canada. The connection with the verb cast has evidently not been obvious enough to regularize the spelling everywhere – apart from the overlap between -er and -or generally, which must also be a factor in the confusion. (See further under -er.) In Britain the fine grade of sugar is increasingly spelled caster, in keeping with the fact that it’s the type for the sugar caster. Yet this connection has also been masked by the spelling castor in the past, and there are still a few examples of castor sugar to be found in the BNC. In American usage it generally goes by the name superfine sugar, .and the spelling is unambiguous. \n None of the above connects with Castor of Castor and Pollux, the twin sons of Zeus and Leda, whose stars (the Gemini) have traditionally been coupled together – though radio astronomers now believe they are light years apart."

British usage is much more focused on catalogue, and it’s the standard spelling as far as New Oxford (1998) is concerned. In BNC data, catalog appears only in specialized documents for library professionals, who are more familiar than most with the Library of Congress Catalog. \n The duality of American usage entails two sets of spellings for the verb, and Merriam-Webster (2000) notes catalogued, cataloguing as well as cataloged, cataloging. The latter are rather uncomfortable in terms of common spelling rules (see -e, and -ce/-ge).

Such a plural implies catastrophy as singular, an alternative form recorded during C17 but not since, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Google searches of the internet carried out in 2002 found thousands of examples of both catastrophy and catastrophies, though they represent less than 2% of all instances of the word.

The catenatives also differ from auxiliaries in the meanings they express. Instead of paraphrasing the modals like other semi-auxiliaries (see auxiliary verbs section 3), they qualify the action of the following verb (as do seem, begin), or else set up a mental perspective on it (as do remember, love). Other examples like seem are: \n appear cease chance continue \n fail finish get happen \n help keep manage stop \n  tend \n  Others like remember are: \n attempt consider detest endeavor \n expect forget hate hope \n intend like prefer regret \n resent risk strive try \n want \n Note that some catenatives can take either to-infinitives or -ing constructions as their complement, others only one of them. \n Catenatives are relatively new in the classification of English verbs, and grammarians still debate which belong to the class. The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) admits only the first group mentioned above, whereas the Introduction to the Grammar of English (1984) allows both. The latter questions whether a third group of verbs could also belong, ones whose complement is a to-infinitive but which require a noun phrase in between: \n He advised her parents to come. \n Other examples of this type are: \n ask entreat invite oblige \n remind request teach tell \n  urge \n These verbs typically express some kind of speech act.

Technically it might then refer to the whole Christian Church, the Church universal, irrespective of orthodoxies and denominations. In practice Catholic frequently refers to the Catholic Church based in Rome, when the point is simply to distinguish it from the Protestant and Orthodox churches (Greek). Examples such as a Catholic country, Spain’s Catholic kings and Catholic primary schools all illustrate this use of Catholic to mean Roman Catholic, as do references to the Catholic-Nationalists of Northern Ireland. But in England one needs to distinguish between Roman Catholic and Anglo-Catholic (the “high” movement within the Church of England), and thus the term Catholic is often qualified one way or the other. Some Protestants and Anglo-Catholics use Roman Catholic (as adjective/noun) to insist that the referents cannot lay claim to the Church universal. Yet theological contentions are not necessarily uppermost in the minds of ordinary members of the Roman Church who prefer to be called just Catholics.

Cauldron is given as the primary spelling in Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n Cauldron and caldron are both respellings of the original loanword caudron from medieval French, designed to show its connection with the Latin caldarium (“hot bath”). The spelling caldron is the earlier of the two, dating from the Middle Ages, whereas cauldron is a Renaissance respelling.

		"title": "caulk, calk or calque",

The spelling caulk is given preference for this over calk in British, Canadian and Australian dictionaries, whereas in American dictionaries it is the other way round. \n 2 Calk is the primary spelling for (i) the small projection on a horseshoe designed to prevent slipping, and (ii) the spiked plate on the soles of shoes worn by loggers. The same spelling also applies to the industrial process in which a design is transferred by pressure from one sheet to another. This usage is occasionally spelled in the French way as calque. \n 3 Calque is the regular spelling for a “loan translation,” the linguistic analogue of the industrial process of calking, but pronounced in the French way so as to rhyme with “talc” rather than “talk.” A calque is an expression created in one language to parallel a particular word or phrase in another. It matches the original expression in structure, but slots into it words from the borrowing language.

British correspondents definitely prefer to put the abbreviation in lower case, where their American counterparts may use upper-case forms. Webster’s Third (1986) presents it without stops as CC, whereas the Random House Dictionary (1987) has it as C.C. \n The function of c.c./cc is to tell the letter’s addressee that an exact copy has been sent to those people named/listed alongside, a convention which serves two rather different purposes.

But words with -ce and -ge vary according to the first vowel of the suffix. \n  If it begins with a (as in -able, -age, -al, -an) or o (as in -ose, -ous, -osity), the word remains unchanged and keeps its e. See for instance: replaceable manageable outrageous \n In words like these, the e serves a vital purpose in preserving the c or g as a “soft” sound: compare replaceable with implacable, and outrageous with analogous. \n But if the suffix begins with e (as in -ed or-er), i (as in -ing, -ism, -ist) or y, words ending in -ce or -ge can drop their e. Think of the following words based on race: \n raced racer racing racism racist racy \n The “s” sound is maintained in each of them through the vowel of the suffix. Alternative means of preserving the “soft” “c”/“g” sounds can be seen in the spellings of forcible and unenforceable, of tangible and changeable.

		"explanation":"In pairs such as advice/advise and device/devise, the -ce and -se have complementary roles, with -ce marking the noun and -se the verb. The -ce is of course pronounced “s,” and the -se “z.” In Britain and Australia this spelling convention also affects licence and practice, so that license and practise must be verbs, while licence and practice are nouns. This makes no difference to their pronunciation, but demands a modicum of grammar to get each spelling in its rightful place. In American English one spelling serves for each word, whatever its grammatical role (see further under license and practice). \n Regional differences also emerge in the American spelling of defense, offense and pretense, as opposed to British defence, offence and pretence. The -ce spellings commit British (and Australian) writers to inconsistencies such as defence/defensive, offence/offensive and pretence/pretension, which Americans are spared. Canadians labor with both systems, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998), using the -ce spelling for defence/offence and -se for pretense. \n The spellings defense, offense and pretense are not only more straightforward, but just as old as the spellings with -ce. Anglo-Norman scribes introduced c into the spellings of both native and borrowed words of English, some of which have become the standard form, e.g. once (earlier “ones”) and grocery (earlier “grossier”). \n International English selection: The -se spellings for defense, offense and pretense have the great advantage of consistency with their derivative forms defensive, offensive, pretension."

All these words go back to the Latin verb cedere (“yield or move”), but the second group are much more recent arrivals in English, mostly post-Renaissance, whereas the first set were actively used in C14 and C15. Middle English scribes turned the Latin ced- into -ceed to bring those words into line with native English ones such as feed and need, which were pronounced the same way. The words ending in -cede came into English from written sources during the Renaissance, hence both their bookish flavor and their classical spelling. \n The divergent spellings of proceed and precede, and of proceeding(s) and procedure, can be explained in the same way. The classical spelling of procedure confirms that it was borrowed later into English (in C17).

Before e and i, it’s not needed because those vowels keep the c soft anyway. The cedilla comes and goes in the spelling of French verbs, depending on the following vowel: \n nous annonc¸ons “we announce” \n  vous annoncez “you announce” \n vous recevez “you receive” \n ils rec¸oivent “they receive” \n In English the cedilla on loanwords is often left out because of its absence from many keyboards and wordprocessors. \n The name cedilla comes from the Spanish zedilla.

In British English, celebrant is occasionally used of the protagonist for a particular cause or point of view, seen in BNC examples such as celebrant of the English country station and celebrant of the mystique of the public school. American examples of these more abstract uses can be found in CCAE examples such as celebrant of the life of Whitman and a John Ford-like celebrant of the American West. \n The alternative celebrator is little used, despite being closer in form to the essential verb celebrate, and recommended by American usage writers of the 1950s to avoid secularization of celebrant. In fact celebrator appears only a handful of times in CCAE: in references to the reveler, as in New Year’s celebrator, and to the protagonist, as in celebrator of diversity.

The scale was devised by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–44), using the freezing and boiling points of pure water as its reference points. They establish a scale from 0 degrees to 100 degrees. The Celsius scale dovetails with the Kelvin scale of temperature, which offers an “absolute zero” temperature of 273 degrees, the theoretical temperature at which gas molecules have zero kinetic energy. Celsius temperatures have been gradually adopted in Britain (and more quickly in Australia) to replace the Fahrenheit system. Older kitchen stoves, and cookery books, are of course calibrated in degrees Fahrenheit. In the US, temperature is still generally measured on the Fahrenheit scale. (See further under Fahrenheit and metrication.) \n The name Celsius is preferred to the metric name centigrade as a way of highlighting the names of famous scientists – part of the naming policy of the Bureau International de Poids et Mesures. Like other scientific eponyms celsius can appear without an initial capital letter (see under eponyms), though in BNC data it’s still capitalized more often than not.

Thus the term Anglo-Celtic used in Canada and Australia refers collectively to immigrants from all parts of the British Isles, as opposed to those who emigrated from Continental Europe and elsewhere. \n The original Celts left traces of their civilization in various places across Continental Europe, in Switzerland, Spain and in France. The people of present-day Brittany still speak a Celtic language, Breton, which is closely related to Welsh. Together, Breton- and Welsh-speakers make up a larger Celtic-speaking population (over 1 million) than the speakers of Scottish and Irish Gaelic (between 100,000 and 200,000, according to estimates in the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, 1987). Celtic (pronounced “seltic”) is nevertheless the rallying cry for the Scottish football team based in Glasgow (as well as that of the Boston-based basketball team). \n Keltic reflects the original Greek name for the Celts: Keltoi. It has been more used by scholars than writers at large, and serves to distinguish the ancient nomadic people from their modern descendants."

		"title": "cement or concrete",
		"explanation":"In their physical applications, these words are sometimes interchanged, as when a concrete mixer is referred to as a cement mixer. Cement is of course the bonding agent in concrete, although concrete’s strength comes from the other ingredients, i.e. the steel reinforcing or crushed stones. The substitution of cement for concrete is therefore an everyday instance of meronymy (see under synechdoche). Figurative uses of cement pick up the sense of bonding as in social cement, and the sense is extended in BNC examples of its use as a verb, as in cement a relationship, cement his authority, cement that deep family loyalty to the institution. The figurative uses of concrete are typically adjectival, as the opposite of abstract in concrete terms, concrete social consequences and the concrete world of experience."

It is a preventive measure, whereas censure voices public criticism of things already done, as when members of government are censured in a formal parliamentary motion. \n As nouns the two words go their separate ways, censor as an agent word “one who censors,” and censure as the abstract noun for “strongly voiced criticism.”"

	{
		"title": "centennial or centenary",
		"explanation":"These are registered as both adjective and noun in most dictionaries, and there’s no controversy over their being “adjectives.” However it becomes debatable when they act as qualifiers, as in Elgar’s birthday centenary celebrations, where they might equally be regarded as nouns in attributive roles. Both centennial and centenary look like Latin adjectives, so there is more room for doubt about their role as nouns, especially if they are relatively rare. Database evidence shows that centenary is a rarity for Americans, whereas centennial is little used by the British. \n British use of centennial (as adjective or noun) has probably been constrained by Fowler’s express preference for centenary, because it matched up better with bicentenary, tercentenary etc. and sesquicentenary (150 years). In BNC data centenary outnumbers centennial by about 25:1, and it’s freely applied to the hundredth anniversary of persons (Prokofiev, Mondrian, James Joyce) as well as institutions large and small (Science Museum, Birmingham’s Book Room). \n Comparable American data from CCAE shows extensive use of centennial (adjective or noun) for the 100-year celebrations of anything from the transcontinental railroad to the Statue of Liberty, and it appears – more permanently – in the names of high schools, tennis competitions, city parks and a range of mountains, among other things. Thus centennial is the dominant term, outnumbering centenary in CCAE by about 10:1. Canadians and New Zealanders share the American preference, while Australians are ambivalent.

Webster’s Third (1986) makes it clear that any of a number of particles is possible (in, at, on, upon, about, (a)round); and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) shows both shift from in to on, and the acceptability of (a)round. So why the fuss about using centre/center around? Webster’s English Usage (1989) traces it to American college composition books of the 1920s, whose authors found it “illogical,” apparently because they were thinking in strictly geometrical terms. In fact mathematicians tend to use centre/center at. \n American and British databases show that center/centre on constructions are a good deal more frequent than center/centre around, by about 5:1, but both serve to identify a focus or topic of interest: \n . . . an economy centered on agriculture \n The debate should not centre on cost. \n Antiwhaling could centre around alternatives to whale products. \n Speculation centered around such companies as T-C Inc. \n As in these examples, there’s some tendency to use around with a plural topic, though both CCAE and BNC could provide counter examples. The writer may be pinpointing a focus of attention, or the “circle” of interest around it, but either way it works without any strict spatial analogy. New Oxford (1998) accepts this use of centre/center around, as being well established and idiomatic. Its meaning may be less focused than the one assumed by its critics, but it clearly indicates the starting point for discussion. \n ♦ For the choice between centre and center, see -re/-er."

		"title": "centuries",
		"explanation":"centuries In the Anglo-Saxon historical tradition, we number centuries by thinking ahead to the boundary with the next one. So the nineteenth century includes any dates from 1801 to 1900; and the twentieth century, all those from 1901 to 2000. The tradition is based on the fact that the first century of the Christian era dates from AD 1 to AD 100, and could not be otherwise since there was no AD 0. \n Whatever the justification, this system of reckoning seems rather perverse. For one thing, it runs counter to the ordinary numerical system, in which we think of decimal sets running from 0 to 9 in each “ten,” or 00 to 99 in each “hundred.” We might reasonably expect the last century to include dates from 1900 to 1999: at least they would all have the number 19.. in common. But no, it’s 1901 to 2000, with the present century starting on 1 January 2001. \n That was also the first day of the twenty-first century, again somewhat perversely, since all but the last year in it will begin with 20 . . . (2010, 2020 etc.). Yet the convention of referring to the years of one century by the next one on is thoroughly established in English, and in other (north) European languages including French, Dutch and German. In both Italian and Spanish however, a reference to a century such as the Quattrocento or el Siglo XIV means “the 1400s” (the famous century of Renaissance painters). In formal English quattrocento would be translated as “the fifteenth century,” though expressions such as the 1400s recommend themselves as clearer and more direct. \n Abbreviations for indicating particular centuries are not standardized and include the following: \n 15th century XV century \n XVth century 15th cent. \n 15th c. 15C C15 \n The first set provide little compacting, and reflect the general reluctance to use abbreviations in the humanities. The Chicago Manual (1993) proposes rather that any references to centuries should be spelled out in full, as fifteenth century etc. Others endorse the use of roman numerals in them as a gesture towards abbreviation, though it may be counterproductive in terms of ease of reading. Those more accustomed to abbreviation accept that the word century can be reduced without impairing communication. Among those in the second set above, the pair with lower case are British style (Ritter, 2002), whereas those with upper case are American. Their compactness is an asset in texts where they occur often (such as this book). C15 has some advantage over 15C in that it could never be mistaken for a reference to temperature reading in degrees Celsius (15 ◦ C ). \n ♦ For indicating dates that span the turn of the century, see under dates."

But as an adjective ceremonial simply means “used in, or as of a ceremony,” for example ceremonial sword, ceremonial dress. Ceremonious is both a synonym for ceremonial and a value-laden word which suggests an emphasis on ceremony for its own sake, or as a mask in strained interaction: he took a relieved and ceremonious farewell. The latter is its only distinctive sense, but it’s in the eye of the beholder and not always clearly separable from the other.

In both British and American English it’s used in relation to aircraft and ships, and to particular professions, such as teachers, nurses, librarians, notaries.

It often serves to preempt debate based on differences in taste, and therefore functions in the same way as the older Latin maxim: de gustibus non est disputandum (“concerning matters of taste there can be no argument”).

They see it simply as a functional title, like that of secretary and treasurer, which indicate a person’s official role in an organization. Others relish the challenge that the word has sustained from the feminist movement, amid pressures to promote nonsexist language. Yet the problem with chairman is seen differently by different people, and so the solutions vary. \n Critics of the word chairman are sometimes concerned that it seems to make women in that role invisible. The alternatives they suggest are chairwoman or lady chairman, which draw attention to the sex of the person concerned, as do terms of address such as Madam Chairman and Madam Chair. More often the concern is that chairman seems to foster the expectation that only a man could fulfil the role. They propose nonexclusive, gender-free alternatives, such as chairperson or chair. Neither of these solutions seems wholly satisfactory, because:  \n ∗ chair combines awkwardly with any verb implying human action – even though it has done this since C17, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), as in a Royal Society minute on a matter referred to me by this Honourable Chair. \n ∗ chairperson suffers from the fact that it more often substitutes for chairwoman than for chairman, and thus tends to have female connotations. This could change, given a steady increase in the proportion of male chairpersons mentioned in current data from the BNC and CCAE. But until then the best solution is to seek an independent, gender-free term, such as convener, coordinator, moderator or president. \n  ♦ For further discussion of these issues, see nonsexist language. \n ♦ For other compounds like chairman, see under man, man- and -man."

		"title": "chaise longue or chaise lounge",
		"explanation":"This French expression meaning “long chair” is applied in English to that eminently relaxing piece of furniture which supports the legs in a resting position, and keeps the upper body at a sufficient angle to allow us to keep up a conversation. Because of the comfort it offers, the chaise longue is sometimes referred to as a chaise lounge – with just a slight rearrangement of the letters of the second word. It is after all a chair in which you lounge about, and it shows folk etymology in action, trying to make sense of an obscure foreignism (see folk etymology). Chaise lounge was first recorded well over a century ago in Ogilvie’s Imperial Dictionary (1855), and its use is widely recognized outside Britain (in American, Canadian and Australian dictionaries), though the New Oxford (1998) simply labels it “US.” Webster’s English Usage (1989) noted its frequent use in the furniture trade and advertising, and that it also appears occasionally in general and literary writing. Chaise lounge and chaise longue are about equally  \n common in CCAE; and the corpus shows that chaise lounge is usually a piece of outdoor patio furniture – except when it’s a Scottish oak chaise lounge. The outdoor/indoor distinction created some angst for journalists reporting on a murder in which the body was found under a chaise lounge/longue inside the enclosed porch [of the house]. The chaise longue meanwhile is often mentioned among collections of antiques (the Empire-style chaise longue), or as an objet d’art, like the chaise longue of hammered scrap metal too hard to lie on. If it is a chaise lounge, the French order of words still helps to distinguish it from the lounge chair, the general term for an “easy chair” – not obviously designed for lounging in but rather for the lounge (room), which in both Britain and Australia is the sitting room of a private house. \n For the plural of chaise longue, Merriam-Webster (2000) indicates chaise longues and chaises longues, in that order. The first treats it like an ordinary English compound (see under plurals), while the second is fully French. With the anglicized chaise lounge, we may expect chaise lounges."

		"title": "charted or chartered",
		"explanation":"These past forms of the verbs chart and charter can be mistaken for each in spoken English, and hence are sometimes interchanged in print. They sound alike in dialects of English which are non-rhotic, i.e. ones in which r is silent after a vowel. So as pronounced by many Britons from southern and eastern areas, and by Antipodeans, the two words are indistinguishable, whereas for most American and Canadian speakers, the r of the second syllable of chartered sets them apart. Note also that most British speakers use different vowels in the second syllables of charted and chartered, which further help to distinguish them. \n The verb chart is a matter of cartography or mapping, either literally or figuratively. During C18, the coasts of New Zealand and eastern Australia were finally charted; but in C21, it’s outer space that remains to be charted, and areas of social and political behavior that are uncharted territory. \n As a verb charter means “set up by charter,” and so institutions may be chartered to fulfill public functions; and individuals such as chartered accountants or chartered engineers have obtained the right to engage in professional practice. The idea of being hired under a specialized contract underlies the chartering of a vehicle (a bus, ship, helicopter etc.), but the fact that it means contracting to cover a particular geographical distance brings it close to chart."

Only when it comes to money is there a great divide, with Americans continuing to use check for a personal bank note, while cheque is preferred by Canadians, Australians and the British. \n Cheque is very much a latter-day spelling, first appearing at the beginning of C18. It was used by the Bank of England to refer to the counterfoil issued for a money order – literally a way of checking each one and preventing forgery. Cheque soon became the name for the money order itself in Britain. The system was adopted somewhat later in the US, though the spelling has remained check. \n  In the same way C18 British English adopted the spelling chequer for a pattern of squares, as in the game chequers and the chequerboard, as well as the figurative chequered career. It replaced the longer-established checker which continues in American and Canadian English.

The editorial convention of capitalizing ethnic and national designations would require Chicano, whatever its grammar (see under capital letters section 1).

This gave it strong political overtones that linger, even though the word is now applied more generally to US citizens of Mexican origin. The word Hispanic provides a less emotively charged way of referring to the Mexican-American, though it is also less specific because it includes other Spanish-speaking immigrants, e.g. those from the Caribbean.

		"title": "China",
		"explanation":"The division of China into two political entities in 1949 makes it important to distinguish them: \n Chinese People’s Republic = Mainland China (capital: Beijing) \n Chinese Nationalist Republic = Taiwan (capital: Taipei) \n The estimated population of Mainland China in 1990 was over 1 billion, that of Taiwan about 20 million. \n In Mainland China the communist revolution led to far-reaching linguistic reforms, including the development of a standard form of Chinese, Putonghua, which involved the modifying and streamlining of more than 2000 traditional characters of the Chinese system. Like “Mandarin” it’s based on the Beijing dialect, but serves as the native language of more than half the people. Other major dialects are clustered in the south of the country: \n ∗ Wu in Shanghai and on the Yangzi valley \n ∗ Yue in Guangzhou and Guandong \n ∗ Min in Taiwan and adjoining provinces on the mainland \n ∗ Hakka used by small groups within the other southern dialect areas \n A phonetic alphabet Pinyin has been used to develop romanized scripts for minority language groups, and for children beginning their education. It also has public uses on street signs and the railway system. Pinyin was officially adopted in 1938, though it was far from the first attempt to romanize Chinese characters. Earlier systems include the Wade-Giles, developed by British scholars in C19; Gwoyeu Romatzyh, designed by Chinese scholars in the 1920s. Pinyin’s roots are in the third, but it differs in the spelling of certain consonants. Some which strike westerners as unusual are the use of: \n q for pre-palatal “ch” \n x for pre-palatal “sh” \n zh for retroflex “j” \n c for alveolar “ts” \n Amid this linguistic evolution, many Chinese placenames have changed, at least in the forms now reaching the western world. Some of the most dramatic are the substitution of Beijing for “Peking,” Guangzhou for “Canton,” and Tianjin for “Tientsin.” Others less revolutionary are Xian for “Sian,” Shandong for “Shantung,” Chong Qing for “Chungking” and Nanjing for “Nanking.” The changes of consonants in these examples show which letters are typically affected, but it’s a good idea to check Chinese names in a large up-to-date atlas."

		"title": "Chinaman or Chinese",
		"explanation":"The word Chinaman is generally felt to have derogatory overtones, probably going back to popular prejudice against Chinese immigrants amid the American goldrush, where the word originated. In American English it’s not helped by John Chinaman, the derisively named stereotype who didn’t stand a Chinaman’s chance of making it. Such connotations make Chinaman dangerous, and public apology was needed in 1990 for a joking reference to a (black) footballer surnamed Rice – as “a Chinaman whose feet never touch the ground.” Even in an ethnically neutral situation, Chinaman is unsafe for ethnic reference. \n In Britain Chinaman was apparently a neutral term for Fowler in the 1920s, when he presented it as the ordinary term for an individual from China, and perhaps for two or three of them (Chinamen). But Gowers revising Fowler in post-imperial Britain (1965) found Chinaman derogatory, and this opinion is echoed in later dictionaries such as Collins (1991) and the New Oxford (1998), though it can scarcely be as derogatory as Chink (see further under racist language). British dictionaries also comment that Chinaman now sounds oldfashioned – smacking too much of imperialism in a post-imperial era, perhaps. Its historical quality is certainly borne out in a number of retrospective citations among the BNC data. A neutral substitute for Chinaman can be found in using Chinese as a noun, although some people find it unsatisfactory for the singular, as in a Chinese. If so, Chinese person or Chinese citizen would serve as a paraphrase. \n Cricketers use chinaman (definitely lower case) to refer to a tricky kind of delivery by a left-handed spin bowler to a right-handed batsman. It may have originated as an oblique reference to a Chinese player on the West Indies side between the wars. At any rate it’s first attributed to a Yorkshire cricketer in 1937. It is known also in Australian cricket, but applied to a ball which breaks in the opposite direction – a matter of semantics rather than physics."

The word is a modern compound of the Greek chloro- (“green”) and phyllon (“leaf ”). The alternative spelling chlorophyl is recognized in North American dictionaries, though it makes no showing in CCAE (against some 50 instances of chlorophyll). For etymologists, the spelling chlorophyl has the disadvantage of connecting it with a different Greek word, phyle meaning “tribe”; but for whatever reason users everywhere seem to have settled on chlorophyll, the longer and etymologically preferable form. The final double ls seem to have stabilized better than in some other English words (see single for double)."

		"explanation":"Is it vocal chords or vocal cords? In contemporary American English vocal cords is more common than vocal chords, by a factor of 2:1 in CCAE – and Webster’s Third (1986) put its weight behind it. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) uses chords as the reference point for the word (at chord and under “vocal”). The two spellings are about equally represented in the BNC, but cords is preferred in technical contexts of writing, and chords in a variety of others. No doubt the popularity of chords connects with the fact that the vocal cords are so often mentioned in connection with sounds and singing. \n Both chord and cord derive from a Greek and then Latin word spelled chorda, which meant both “gut” and “string of a musical instrument.” In the Middle Ages it was just cord, and this is still the spelling for plain ordinary string etc., and for anatomical uses of the word, as in spinal cord and umbilical. The vocal cords are however not cord-like in shape, and are more accurately described as “vocal folds.” \n The spelling chord in mathematics results from the “touching up” of cord during the English Renaissance, when many words with classical ancestors were respelled according to their ancient form. The musical chord was also respelled, as if it came from the same source. In fact it is a clipped form of accord (“a set of sounds which agree together”). Of all the cases of cord mentioned so far, it least deserves to have an h in its spelling."

Those unacquainted with French are unlikely to know that there might ever have been a circumflex on words like: \n baton chassis crepe depot hotel role \n In French the circumflex often marks the disappearance of a letter (such as s) from the spelling of the word, as is clear when we compare chˆateau with castle, fˆete with feast, and hˆotel with hostel. \n Circumflexes have also marked the loss of vowels from particular words, or the fact that the vowel was once long. But from its first appearance in C16 French, the applications of the circumflex have been various and inconsistent. Unlike the acute and grave accents, it does not correspond to a particular pronunciation of the vowel it surmounts. The etymological information it provides is less important to English than French users of the word (though even in France there have been concerted efforts recently to do away with the circumflex, on the grounds of its redundancy). This further reduces the incentive to keep the circumflexes on French loanwords in English."

Yet clad is definitely the strong contender in current British and American English for the passive past participle and the adjective: \n He was clad only in a short towelling robe... \n Clad in waterproofs and wellies, we walked along the river. \n It readily forms compound adjectives, such as khaki-clad men; a blue-clad figure; Gucci-clad Latinos; a youthful, jeans-and-leather-clad operative.

		"explanation":"The relationship between these words is changing. Both imply that something is in a special class, and in their three centuries of use there has been a great deal of overlap between them, as with other -ic/-ical pairs (see further that heading). Both words relate things to the classics of high culture, and especially to the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome – hence the phrase to study the classics. \n  But since the late C19, classic has been widening its frontiers and associating itself with all sorts of everyday things, not just matters of culture. The noun classic was applied to important horse races last century, and to motor races this century. With a capital letter, Classic now typically refers to a golf or tennis tournament. Elsewhere the word classic may be applied to anything from a familiar political ploy to the less outrageous types of fashion. The criteria for using the word may or may not be obvious to others, only that it’s intended to express approval and to commend. The original Oxford Dictionary observed it, commenting that such usage was “burlesque, humorous.” A century later it seems perfectly standard and straightforward. \n While classic has become a more popular and subjective word, classical maintains the higher ground. It is suffused with a sense of history and great artistic traditions: classical music is associated with a period of outstanding music in western Europe in C18 and C19; and classical ballet embodies what for many is still the acme of balletic technique, developed last century. \n Occasionally classical is used in the freer ways now enjoyed by classic. There is however another rival for that informal terrain: classy. Its links with the word class (“high class”) are still quite strong, but it is acquiring overtones of “stylish,” “superior,” which bring it close to the attitudinal uses of classic. Classy is more direct and down-to-earth however, so it can probably coexist with classic for some time to come."

	{
		"title": "clauses",
		"explanation":"The clause is the basic grammatical unit in any sentence. Whether they know it or not, people produce many more clauses than sentences whenever they communicate. At its bare minimum, a clause consists of two elements: \n ∗ a subject (S) (whatever is being identified for comment), and \n ∗ a predicate (P) (whatever is stated about the subject) \n For example: \n The dollar is rising \n S P \n A dreamy expression came over her face. \n S P \n The predicate always contains a finite verb, e.g. is rising, came in these examples. But often there are other elements such as objects, complements, adverbs or adverbial adjuncts (such as over her face). See further under predicate. \n With their subject/predicate structure, clauses are clearly different from phrases (which revolve around a single head: see phrases). Note however that modern grammarians also recognize nonfinite clauses (usually without a subject or finite verb) in subordinate constructions. (see below, section 3, for subordination, and also nonfinite clause.) The number of clauses in a sentence, and the relationship between them, is the basis of distinguishing several different types of sentence: simple, compound and complex. \n 1 Simple sentences consist of a single clause, like the two examples above. They may however embody extra adverbials and dependent phrases: \n After months of decline, the dollar is rising. \n (adv. phr.) S P \n The dollar finally began to rise, despite economic anxiety. \n S (adv.) P (v. phr.) (adv. phr.) \n Thus simple sentences may have several phrases in them. \n  2 In compound sentences, two or more clauses are coordinated, i.e. linked in such a way as to have equal status as statements. (Hence coordination as the name for this relationship, or alternatively parataxis.) The coordinates are usually joined by conjunctions such as and, but, or or nor, though a semicolon or occasionally a comma can also serve to coordinate. For example: \n  example: \n a) They came and they brought their dog. \n b) They came; their dog came with them. \n c) I came, I saw, I conquered. \n d) She didn’t answer or show any emotion. \n Compound sentences that are coordinated with punctuation rather than conjunctions (as in [c]) are said to have asyndetic coordination. (See asyndeton and comma splice.) When the same subject appears in two clauses coordinated by a conjunction, it’s often omitted from the second clause, as in (d). In sentence (a) however, the subject is repeated in the second clause to draw extra attention to it. (See further under ellipsis section 1.) \n 3 In complex sentences the clauses are linked so as to give one of them superior status. The superior one is known as the main clause (or principal clause), while the other is subordinated to it and so is called the subordinate (or dependent) clause. The relationship is thus one of subordination or hypotaxis. The differentiation of roles is marked by the use of particular conjunctions, sometimes called subordinating conjunctions (see further under conjunctions). The following are complex sentences: \n He pleaded insanity so that the charge would be dropped. \n main clause subordinate clause \n Because he pleaded insanity, the charge was dropped. \n subordinate clause main clause \n Notice the different effect of the subordinate clause in these sentences. In the first it simply acts as a coda to the main clause; in the second it draws attention to both the main clause and itself, because of its prime position. (See further under information focus.) \n 4 Types of subordinate clause. In traditional grammar the three types distinguished are: \n relative (or adjectival) noun (or content) adverbial (or adjunct) \n As their names suggest, they function as adjectives, nouns and adverbs respectively, in relation to the main clause. \n a) Relative clauses attach further information to nouns or pronouns in the main clause:  \n The book which I had in my hand had once been banned. \n The book was written by someone who mocked conventional values. \n The examples show how relative clauses serve to define or further describe the noun or pronoun which they modify. (See further under relative clauses section 4.) \n b) Noun clauses take the place of a noun or noun phrase in the main clause: \n They explained what was going on. \n  What was going on took some explaining. \n The noun clause works as either subject, object or complement of the main clause. In the first example it is the object: in the second, the subject. (See further under noun clause.) \n c) Adverbial clauses attach further information to the verb of the main clause, detailing how, when, where or why the action or event took place: \n Her eyes lit up as if the sun had risen. (HOW) \n His eyes lit up when he heard the news. (WHEN) \n She would venture where others had failed. (WHERE) \n He would venture because the time was ripe. (WHY) \n She would succeed although they weren’t yet out of the woods. (CONCESSION) \n He would succeed if only he could raise the capital. (CONDITION)  \n They worked on it as no-one ever had before. (COMPARISON) \n The project would work so that no-one would doubt its value. (RESULT) \n Modern grammars such as the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) distinguish adverbial clauses of similarity/comparison like the one above from comparative clauses proper. The latter have a comparative or equative element in the main clause (eg. more, -er), which connects with than or as in the subordinate clause: \n He liked a bigger house than I did. Comparative clauses are thus regarded as an additional type of subordinate clause."

But cleave (2) has provided us with cleavage, the butcher’s cleaver, and a number of expressions such as cloven-footed, cloven hoof, cleft palate and cleft stick.

The form cloven belongs only to cleave (2), while cleft was originally part of cleave (1), but eventually annexed by cleave (2)."

		"title": "cleft sentences",

A similar rearranging of the basic sentence elements (known as the pseudo-cleft sentence) helps to foreground the action of the verb, as in: \n What Jane noticed was the signature. \n Both cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences help to sharpen the information focus in a sentence, and to signal a change of focus when necessary. (See further under information focus.) \n  Cleft sentences raise several questions of grammatical agreement: \n ∗ Can the verb in the clause after it is / it was be plural? Yes, and in fact it should be, if its subject is plural: \n It is her relatives who have insisted on it. \n  ∗ What happens with the pronouns? In formal style one uses the subject (nominative) form of pronouns: I, he, she, we, you, they. The verb agrees with that pronoun: \n It is I who am unsure. \n It is s/he who is unsure. \n It is we/you/they who are unsure. \n However informal usage allows the object pronouns: me, him, her, us, them. The third person singular verb is then used for either first or second person singular (as well as third): \n It’s me who is unsure. \n It’s you who is in need of help. \n ∗ What other conjunctions apart from who can be used? The relative that is often used in cleft sentences, in references to people as well as objects. That is also preferred to when and where by some, who would correct It was on Sunday when I saw him to It was on Sunday that I saw him. The basis of their objection is not explained, and when/where are certainly used as relative pronouns in cleft constructions. In speech, intonation makes their relative role clear, whereas in writing it may be ambiguous until you reach the end of the sentence. As often, our control of written language has to be tighter for reliable communication."

In current British and Australian English it now refers to the rather lowly office role of keeping accounts, filing documents, photocopying etc. The connection with paper documentation is less central in North America, where the clerk may be employed in retailing as a sales clerk, or in hotel reception as a desk clerk.

As the examples show, the ad hoc words in which it means “joint” are often given hyphens, but the hyphen is left out of the established ones, except those which are liable to be misread and perhaps misunderstood, e.g. co-worker. The debate usually centres on those in which co- precedes an o, such as co(-)operate and co(-)ordinate. In the US they are set solid like the rest, though usage in the UK is still somewhat divided. BNC data show substantial support for both forms, weighted towards the hyphened forms, but New Oxford (1998) prioritizes the solid setting, which must be the way of the future. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the major dictionaries and editorial references all support the solid setting. If you follow suit, there can be no misunderstanding because no other words look remotely like them, and the problem of misreading becomes trivial. \n Co- words which remain bones of contention are clippings or backformations such as co-ed, co-op and co-opt. On these, British writers are totally in favor of the hyphen, and their American counterparts more divided. Coed outnumbers co-ed by more than 2:1 in CCAE data, but co-op and co-opt prevail over coop and coopt. The solid settings are thus beyond the frontier for most. Again we might ask how essential the hyphen is. Could the words be misread and misunderstood without it? (What could they be mistaken for?) Without a capital letter a coed school can scarcely be misread in terms of Coed, the Welsh placename element. Does the University Coop really suggest chickens coming home to roost? Homographic words are usually disambiguated by their context (see homonyms), and the hyphen becomes redundant. But there’s no harm in a little redundancy!"

		"title": "cocotte or coquette",
		"explanation":"Both these French loanwords are about women and sexuality, but if the coquette makes men her victims, men have the advantage over the cocotte. Cocotte is colloquial French for prostitute, while grande cocotte is the expression for the upmarket type kept in luxury by her lover. Alternatively, she is a poule de luxe (roughly “a luxury bird”). The coquette differs in the flirtatious independence she maintains while exploiting the affections of her admirers. Both words are ultimately derived from coc, the Old French word for “rooster.”"

		"explanation":"This Latin phrase meaning “I think therefore I am” is surprisingly well known in the English-speaking world. The seminal utterance was that of French philosopher Descartes in 1637, which has been mediated through British philosophers of C19 and C20. The words seem to express the essence of existentialism, and the ultimate syllogism (see deduction). Descartes himself insisted that the statement was simply a way of asserting the involvement of self in any act of thinking. He was concerned about the basis of knowledge, and how far intuition plays a part in it."

		"title": "coherence or cohesion, coherent or cohesive",
		"explanation":"There are broad differences between coherence/cohesion and coherent/cohesive, even though all four are related to the verb cohere (“stick together”). None of them retain the literal meaning of the verb itself, but the second word in each pair still carries a sense of bonding together, as in the cohesion within the party or a cohesive defense force. The first word in each pair has moved further away, and implies a consecutive and logical linkage from one thing to the next, as in the coherence of his argument or a coherent plan. This extended meaning is underscored in the negatives incoherence and incoherent. Cohesion and cohesive lack established negatives – a sign that they are more recent arrivals (from late C17 and C18), whereas coherence/coherent are from C16. \n 1 Coherence in writing. Communication of any kind needs to be both coherent and cohesive: to be integrated and logical in its development, as well as effectively bonded in its expression. The coherence comes from thinking about the sequence and integration of ideas, whether you are writing or speaking. Even a fiction world has to be imaginatively consistent and provide plausible dramatic development. In nonfiction it’s vital that the statements made are somehow related, as being matched or deliberately contrasted, or linked as general/particular, problem/solution or cause/effect. Some underlying logic of development, e.g. deduction or induction, is needed, though it may not be spelled out as such. (See further under deduction, induction and argument.) \n 2 Cohesion in writing is the network of verbal connections on the surface of the text, which link one reference with another and mark the continuity of ideas. In fiction, the pronouns he and she help to keep tabs on the protagonists, as in the following extract from Cliff Hardy’s Heroin Annie: \n When she came out at twenty to six she was recognisable from her walk; she still moved well, but there was something not proud about the way she carried her head. Her hair had darkened to a honey colour and she wore it short. In a lumpy cardigan and old jeans she headed across the pavement to a battered Datsun standing at the kerb; no-one stood aside for her. \n This “portrait of a lady” keeps its focus on Annie with the unobtrusive aid of she and her in successive sentences. Cohesion is also provided by the sequence of references to her appearance, and then the street phenomena, pavements, car, the crowd, as reminders of the dramatic context. \n In nonfiction, the pronouns (especially it, this and that) and the as well, are again important in ensuring continuity of reference. Other cohesive aids in informative and argumentative writing are the conjunctions, which forge links between one statement and another, and make explicit the underlying relationship (of similarity, contrast, cause and effect, etc.; see further under conjunctions). The links between clauses or phrases can also be made by ellipsis (see under that heading). Yet much of the cohesion still comes through the words that express the subject matter, and through synonyms and antonyms which maintain the same meaning. (See further under synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms and synedoche.) \n Note that most cohesive links work anaphorically, i.e. by reference back to an antecedent. Yet it is possible to forge a forward-looking cohesive link, as in narratives which begin: \n It was the most delightful of occasions – an alfresco lunch in relaxed company. \n This cataphoric form of cohesion is however much less common than the anaphoric. See further under anaphora. \n Most writers succeed in maintaining enough cohesive links in the texts they compose. But the conjunctions deserve extra thought, to ensure that those chosen underscore the logical links between statements (see conjunctions section 3); and it pays to check any sequences of pronouns, in case ambiguity has crept in. See for example: \n He waited until the boss had finished reading his letter. (Whose letter was it?) \n Such problems are always more obvious when you come back to edit at a later stage. \n 3 Noncohesive texts. In fact, it takes effort to write something which is totally lacking in coherence and cohesion. One author who tried was hailed as a great poet, in a notorious Australian literary hoax. This was “Ern Malley,” the pseudonym adopted by James McAuley and Harold Stewart when they offered for publication a set of verses concocted out of bits and pieces from the books that happened to be on their desks at the time. “We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them into nonsensical sentences.” A sample of the result, from the poem “Egyptian register,” begins: \n The hand that burns resinous in the sky \n Which is a lake of roses, perfumes, idylls  \n Breathed from the wastes of the Tartarean heart \n The skull gathers darkness like an inept mountain \n That broods on its aeons of self-injury ... \n Knowing the intention behind it, you are unlikely to look for coherence or meaningful connections in it. But Max Harris who published the poems in 1944 certainly did. It shows how ready we are to assume that printed text is coherent and cohesive, though it’s as well to maintain a little skepticism. \n ♦ Compare gobbledygook."

		"title": "cohort",
		"explanation":"How many people does it take to make a cohort? One or many? Originally the cohort was a unit of the Roman army (about 600 men), and this meaning, as well as the more loosely defined “retinue,” are still around at the turn of the second millennium: \n He moved out of the studio, followed by his cohort of technicians and production assistants, who thumped him on the back ... \n But the commonest meaning in current British English is its application to a notional experimental, educational or sociological group, as in a birth cohort, dropouts from a primary school cohort 1980–5, or an ageing cohort of teachers. This technical application has quickly become commonplace, as in the following from BNC and CCAE \n the cohort for the minibus gathered \n a new cohort of frank but liberal commentators \n on race \n Since World War II, usage originating in North America has cohort as a synonym for a single “colleague,” “partner,” “accomplice” or “companion,” and this is its meaning in about half of its appearances in CCAE. Examples include: a distinguished cohort, his cohort in the Cimarosa concerto [for Two Flutes], a cohort in crime, his cohort in drug dealing. In American English cohort can also be used figuratively, as for the tennis player who looked as if frustration were her cohort. The cohort as human companion was first recognized and challenged by American usage writers in the 1950s, but is now accepted by Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000). In Britain the usage is also quite widespread, despite the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) label “chiefly US.” A usage note in New Oxford (1998) comments that cohort was used to mean “colleague” in the majority of citations from the current Oxford Reading Programme; and a handful of instances are to be found in the BNC, typically in media and business reporting: \n But what of Chloe’s Playaway cohort, Brian Cant? \n He left Allied Dunbar last October, at the same time as chief executive Mike Wilson, a 20-year cohort who was viewed as his successor, and sales director Keith Carby. \n Citations like these do not support the New Oxford’s label “derogatory,” however unpopular the word is with some in Britain, as a newish Americanism."

		"explanation":"Both names say something about this salad of raw cabbage, though coleslaw is closer to its origins in Dutch koolsla. The first part is cognate with the English word kale, and the second, a Dutch colloquial abbreviation of salade. Cold slaw is folk etymology making sense of the unfamiliar first element – and perhaps registering English protest at uncooked cabbage. Its record from 1794 is half a century earlier than the first instance of coleslaw, and four out of the five Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations for C19 are for cold slaw. This early start helps to explain why coldslaw is still known in American usage, and registered in Webster’s Third (1986). However it makes little showing in CCAE, where cole(-)slaw is the dominant form. In terms of setting, coleslaw outnumbers cole slaw by about 5:2, and cole-slaw is very rare.

		"explanation":"Any place of entertainment which calls itself a coliseum or colosseum invokes the famous Colosseum of Rome, the huge amphitheatre built by Vespasian in the first century AD. Its name expresses all that we know in the word colossal, and it was evidently the ultimate entertainment centre. Smaller amphitheatres and stadiums, built on the same model elsewhere in the Roman Empire, turned it into a generic word, and it comes to us through medieval Latin (and Italian) as coliseum. This form of the word is used by Byron in reference to Vespasian’s original, when he declares (through Childe Harold): \n While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand ... \n The neo-Latin form Coliseum is the one taken up by C20 entertainment centres in London and its suburbs; and especially for large, covered or partly covered sporting venues across the American continent from New York to Los Angeles. In generic and familiar references to such structures, it appears as coliseum, without a capital letter. The name Colosseum is now mostly reserved for Rome’s magnificent ruin, apart from the Colosseum Theatre in Johannesburg, and the Tokyo Ariake Colosseum, a sports stadium. Others who have capitalized on the classical form of the name are the jazz-rock bands Colosseum I and Colosseum II. The word is still portentous, despite changes in public sports and entertainments."

Collectable is the simple English formation based on the verb collect, and preferred by the British according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989); whereas Webster’s Third (1986) gives priority to the latinate form collectible. Data from BNC shows that collectable is much preferred in Britain for all adjectival uses, ranging from the most literal (a collectable tax, a car collectable on your arrival ) to the now common sense of “being a collector’s item,” as in Chinese art is still collectable. The few BNC citations for collectible all converge on the latter meaning. By contrast CCAE confirms the strong American preference for collectible for all meanings of the word, from the collectible amount for lawsuits to rare and collectible comic artworks. The use of collectible as a noun (a collectible) is more evident in the American data. The very few American examples of collectable are all adjectives, but with hundreds spelled collectible, it doesn’t add up to grammatical division of labor (collectable for the adjective and collectible for the noun). Americans prefer the neoclassical here, but not always. See further under -able/-ible."

Many are not species-specific (cf. herd of cows, flock of crows,) and so the exact type of animals must be specified, at least on first reference. As complex phrases they usually take singular agreement; but when reduced to herd they can be construed in the plural, like human collective nouns, at least in British and Australian English. Collective terms for objects behave rather like the animal terms, in taking singular agreement when they indicate the configuration of a set of items, e.g. a bunch of keys, a crop of plums, a pile of logs. However when these terms are used as general quantifiers, as in a bunch of losers, a crop of winners, they often take plural agreement (see agreement section 5). \n The term collective noun is also associated with some very traditional collective words applied to one species only, such as covey of partridges, gaggle of geese, pride of lions.

		"title": "collocations",
		"explanation":"Collocation is the tendency of words to go with particular others in a sequence. There may be only one word which can go with a particular verb, as in the mind boggles or with lips pursed. Why this is so is not obvious, any more than the reason why we speak of melted butter and molten lead. They are just some of the conventional collocations of English. \n Collocations of another kind are to be found in phrasal verbs: bear up, browned off, butt in, carry out etc., where distinctive meanings are latent in the combinations of verb and particle. Compare carry out a plan with carry out the rubbish. Knowing which particle to use in the non-literal collocation is a challenge for the second-language learner. Even native speakers may puzzle over the slightly different collocations used in speech and writing. In written documents, wait for (someone) is the standard collocation, whereas in conversation it’s often expressed as wait on. Thus some collocations vary according to context, and/or the structure of the sentence. The choice of particle after different has a lot to do with both: see different from, different to, and different than. \n Collocations differ from idioms in that their meaning is never so far removed from the literal value of their components, or anything like a figure of speech. Compare expressions such as a red herring and shoot (oneself ) in the foot (= true idioms) with any of the examples in the previous paragraph; and see further under idiom. \n Collocations differ from cliches´ in that they have an accepted place in the language, and are not thought of as hackneyed expressions in need of replacement.

They smack of easy-going exchanges between people, where there’s no need to dot the is and cross the ts: \n Hang on a tick, we’ll get the cabbie to put the bike on top, and be there in time to have a bite. \n The colloquialisms of spoken discourse are often short or shortened words like tick, bike and cabbie, familiar abbreviations which reduce demands on the listener, and telescope the less essential syllables. Contractions such as we’ll work in the same way to communicate more (or at least as much) with less. Colloquial idioms like hang on and have a bite also contribute to an allusive style which relies on the context and other knowledge shared by the speaker, e.g. what the time frame is. When conversing we take a lot for granted to ensure the ready exchange of words. Colloquialisms express basic rather than precise meanings, and the speaker’s desire to minimize verbal barriers. The communicative value of colloquialisms is thus almost the antithesis of formal writing. Where verbal precision is paramount, they would be counterproductive. Yet in more interactive styles of writing, a sprinkling of colloquialisms helps to lighten the discourse. The main issue then is to ensure that their currency is as wide as the likely readership.

It allows the writer to detail something or give a set of examples without overloading the introductory part of the sentence. Note that what comes after the colon is not usually a sentence itself – a point on which colons differ from semicolons (see under semicolon). Style manuals agree (Chicago Manual, 2003; Oxford Guide to Style, 2002) that the word following the colon stays in lower case, unless it’s a formal quotation, slogan or motto. For example: \n On the laboratory door was a new sign: \n Trespassers prosecuted. \n The word following a colon in the subtitle of a book or article may be capitalized (see further under titles). \n  A colon is quite often used these days before presenting an extended quotation from a printed source (whereas the combination of colon plus dash [:–] for this is obsolescent). Direct quotations from someone’s speech are now also prefaced by a colon, especially in newspapers and magazines, where once a comma was the standard punctuation. The use of commas with quotations is increasingly confined to literary fiction. (See quotation marks section 3.) Other uses of colons: \n ∗ to separate the headings in memos from the specific details: \n  MEMO TO: Leslie Smith, Manager \n FROM: Robin Jones \n SUBJECT: Uniforms for staff \n In the US, business letters also have a colon following the salutation, as in:  \n Dear Mr Smith: \n Your letter (3/9/03) arrived too late for the order to be modified ... \n ∗ to separate the main title from the subtitle of a book (see under titles) \n ∗ to separate elements in literary and biblical citations \n Romeo and Juliet Act V:ii \n Revelation 12:20 \n ∗ to separate elements in bibliographical references, such as the publisher from the place of publication, or the date of publication from the page numbers (see referencing sections 2 and 3) \n  ∗ to indicate ratios in mathematics, as in 3:1 \n A further use of the colon in the US and Canada is to space the hours from the minutes in expressions of time, e.g. 5:30 pm.

		"title": "comma",
		"explanation":"Commas are an underused punctuation mark, the chief casualty of the trend towards open punctuation (see punctuation section 1). They have a vital role to play in longer sentences, separating information into readable units, and guiding the reader as to the relationship between phrases and items in a series. \n 1 A single comma ensures correct reading of sentences which start with a longish introductory element: \n a) Before the close of the season, you should see this stimulating new play. \n b) Before the season closes, you should see this stimulating new play. \n Whether the sentence begins with a phrase as in (a), or a clause as in (b), it benefits by having a comma to show where the introductory element ends and the main statement begins. The comma allows the reader to pause between the two parts, and to absorb each one properly. Introductory strings of words often express the ongoing theme of a paragraph, or serve to highlight a change or adjustment to the theme (see further under information focus). \n When the introductory string is short (just two or three words), the separating comma may not be necessary – except to prevent misreading. In a case like the following, the comma is essential: \n Down below the bridge deck was half submerged in the river. \n A comma following “down below” will prevent the reader having to go over the sentence twice to get its structure. Commas can also make a difference to the reading of a sentence with a relative clause (see relative clauses section 4), and those with negatives in them (see negatives section 2). \n 2 Pairs of commas in mid-sentence help to set off any string of words which is either a parenthesis or in apposition to whatever went before. \n The ancient trees, oaks and elms, were sprouting new leaves. (apposition) \n Dead canyons, all nature in them reduced to desiccation, came alive with the sound of rain. (parenthesis) \n Note that a pair of dashes could have been used instead of commas with the parenthesis, in both formal and informal writing. \n 3 Sets of commas separate serial items, such as: a) strings of predicative adjectives, as in: It looks big, bold, enticing. Note that strings of attributive adjectives do not necessarily need to be separated: She was driving a flashy red sports car. The adjectives in sequences like those are of several different types (evaluative, descriptive, definitive), and are in no danger of misreading. Where they belong to the same type, as in a long, turgid, boring lecture, commas are useful separators. (See further under adjectives.) \n b) a series of nouns or noun phrases, as in: Drinking at the waterhole were cockatoos, emus, budgerigars and kangaroos of several kinds. Whether there should or should not be a comma between the two last items (the so-called serial comma or series comma) is sometimes hotly debated. American editorial practice, as described in the Chicago Manual (2003) insists on a comma before the and, although Webster’s Standard American Style Manual (1985) admits that the serial comma is as often absent as present in its citation files. In British practice there’s an Oxford/Cambridge divide. The serial comma has always been part of “Oxford” style, according to Ritter (2002), whereas Butcher (Copy-editing, 1992) notes both practices and the need to observe either consistently. In Canada and Australia the serial comma is recommended only to prevent ambiguity or misreading, according to Editing Canadian English (2000) and the Australian government Style Manual (2002). In a sentence like the one shown above, a serial comma is not needed to disambiguate the items. However it’s a different matter with the following: \n Drinking at the waterhole were cockatoos, emus, flocks of budgerigars and kangaroos. \n Since the word flock does not collocate with kangaroos, a comma before and, to separate flocks of budgerigars from kangaroos is desirable. Note that once there are commas within individual items in a series, semicolons must be used to separate each item from the next: \n Drinking at the waterhole were white cockatoos, jostling each other for position; a mob of kangaroos, large and small; and a surprisingly tentative group of emus. \n 4 The disappearing comma \n ∗ with numbers (see numbers section 1) \n ∗ with dates. Depending on the order (day, month and year, or month, day and year), the comma may or may not be necessary. See under dates. \n ∗ with addresses on envelopes. To ensure accurate reading by the electronic scanners, postal authorities now recommend the omission of commas (and all punctuation) from addresses on envelopes.

Ideally there would be either (a) heavier punctuation (a semicolon or full stop / period) at the junction; or (b) an appropriate conjunction, such as since or (in this case) the relative pronoun whose instead of its. The two statements would come across better with any of those adjustments. \n The degree of fault in comma splices is nevertheless relative to the length of the components and how well integrated they are.

They are the short, sharp forms of verbs which are used on the parade ground, or in written instructions: \n Squad, march! \n Switch on the automatic control to the oven. Set the clock to the desired starting and finishing times. Select the temperature ... \n In instructions and recipes imperatives are regularly found at the start of sentences. \n Other, less direct ways of expressing commands are also available in English, particularly if you want to soften the abruptness of the imperative, and to adopt the role of counselor rather than commander in the document you’re writing. The following sentences illustrate the range from direct command to oblique instruction: \n Switch on the oven. \n You must first switch on the oven. \n Make sure you switch on the oven. \n The oven should be switched on. \n In face-to-face situations, the command can be rephrased as a question: Could you switch on the oven? This seems to allow more discretion to the other party, turning the instruction into a kind of collaboration. See further under imperative."

		"explanation":"Borrowed from French, this phrase means “as it should be.” It was adopted into English in the courtly C18, to refer to matters of etiquette and correct social behavior. It commends as proper conduct whatever it is attached to. The phrase allows more freedom of choice than certain other French phrases which refer to etiquette. De regle ` means “required by rule or convention”; and de rigueur (roughly “in strictness”) suggests that the whole weight of social opinion is behind it, to make it an absolute necessity."

		"explanation":"Both words are of course from the verb commit and provide an abstract noun for it. Some dictionaries seem to say that they are interchangeable, yet they differ in their breadth and frequency of use. Commitment is much more common and widely used for committing oneself to anything, be it a religion, amateur sport, or reducing the consumption of paper. The statement “I have another commitment” can mean almost any activity. Committal by contrast has been particularly associated with legal processes, the committal hearing and committal proceedings, which involve the examination of evidence before a full trial. The formal burial of a body is also referred to as a committal. So there are ritual and legal overtones to committal which commitment is free of."

Mutual satisfaction implies the satisfaction which two people give to each other, and mutual agreement emphasizes the fact that something is agreed to by both parties (assuming there is no tautology). Reciprocity is carried to excess in a mutual admiration society. Mutual has also long been used to refer to a reciprocal relationship which is enjoyed by more than one other person, as in the title of Charles Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend, published in 1865. Yet for some reason this usage was censured in later C19, as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes. The dictionary also noted that mutual was the only possible word in expressions like Dickens’s title.

		"title": "commonwealth and Commonwealth",
		"explanation":"The word commonwealth has always been a political football. It was first used by social reformers of early C16, who wanted to express in English the notion of the ideal republic, existing for the common good, and not advantaging the rich and powerful. (Weal[th] then meant “welfare” rather than “affluence,” and common was to match public.) Several of the original American states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, are commonwealths by charter, and the word expressed republican and antimonarchic ideals which were popular in C19 America. The notion is institutionalized in titles such as Virginia Commonwealth University, Commonwealth Transportation Board and Commonwealth (or Commonwealth’s) Attorney. The ideals embedded in commonwealth appealed to Australian federationists for similar reasons, and it was set into the nation’s official title (the Commonwealth of Australia) at the Federal Convention held in Sydney in 1891. Other former British colonies such as Canada and New Zealand adopted the title Dominion. \n The republican associations of commonwealth were presumably not strongly felt by the British government when it renamed what had been the British Empire as the British Commonwealth, with the king or queen as its head. At the same time the Imperial Institute became the Commonwealth Institute, and the Imperial Games the Commonwealth Games. The adoption of the word for this post-imperial purpose led successive Australian prime ministers in the 1960s to declare publicly their preference for “Australian Government” rather than Commonwealth of Australia. At the turn of the millennium the term “Commonwealth style” is still used by some for editorial practices associated with federal government documents, but longer-term uses of Commonwealth are caught up in the debate over Australia becoming a republic. \n The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), consisting of 12 former Soviet nations, is the newest political grouping to embrace the word."

		"explanation":"Do the following mean the same? \n a net loss of 8 compared with the 1990 result... \n a net loss of 8 compared to the 1990 result... \n What difference there may seem to be is probably affected by one’s regional background (American or British) – despite the fact that the major English dictionaries give separate definitions to the two structures. Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) both suggest that compared with is used when the comparison is part of a broad analysis, and compared to when it’s a matter of specifically likening one thing to another. But the distinction is probably more honored in the breach than the observance. Webster’s English Usage (1989) found little correlation between the two particles and the two meanings, and that the two meanings were not necessarily separable anyway. It concluded that any tendency to choose compared to for the meaning “liken” could only be demonstrated for the active verb, not when it was passive or just a past participle. The very similar frequencies of compared to and compared with in data from CCAE also suggest that the two constructions are used indifferently in American English. \n In British English compared with is a good deal more frequent than compared to: the ratio is about 2:1 in BNC data. Also noteworthy is the fact that compared to appears more often than compared with among spoken data and scripted dialogue. This suggests that it’s the more informal of the two constructions, the one you use when speaking off the cuff, rather than when crafting your prose. \n The preference for compared with was once underpinned by the latinist’s insistence that with was the only possible particle, because the prefix in compare is the Latin cum “with.” Like other Latin-derived principles of usage, its influence has been more pervasive in Britain, and helped to underscore the use of compared with. Yet even there, compared is increasingly construed with to, on the analogy of similar words and structures such as likened to and similar to. \n The regional preferences for construing compared apply also to the adjective comparable. In British usage comparable to and comparable with are both freely used, appearing in the ratio 4:3 in BNC data. American usage meanwhile is strongly inclined to comparable to, by the evidence of CCAE. \n ♦ Compare averse to, discussed under adverse or averse."

Apart from that, both words have their special domains. Newly developed meanings in linguistics, biology and geology are attached to competence; while competency prevails in education and vocational training, where competency-based training insists that students take away identifiable skills. \n The two words have shared a number of meanings. When first recorded in English competence/ competency connected with the verb compete (“contest”), expressing meanings which are now attached to competition. But in Latin and in Renaissance English, compete also meant “come together” and figuratively “be convenient or fitting.” The present-day meanings of competence/ competency (“fitness or adequacy”) are fossils of this now extinct sense of compete, preserved in legal usage and largely confined there until C18. \n In C20 English, competency has acquired a plural form, often found in the phrase core/key competencies. This makes it a countable noun, while competence remains a mass noun only. Such grammatical differentiation is not uncommon among -nce/-ncy pairs. See further under that heading, and under nouns."

		"title": "complacent or complaisant",
		"explanation":"Complacent has been making inroads into the domain of complaisant during the last two centuries. Both words ultimately derive from the Latin verb complacere (“please”), though the meaning is more evident in complaisant, the form borrowed from French. In English complaisant has meant “eager to please” or “obliging” in a positive sense, while complacent, the regular Latin form, usually means “pleased with oneself and with the status quo.” Its overtones now are somewhat negative, suggesting uncritical self-satisfaction and a reluctance to improve things. \n Complaisant is now a rare word, greatly outnumbered by complacent in both American and British databases, and suffering from convergence with it. Examples such as a complaisant House of Commons and his apparently complaisant wife show complaisant meaning not just “eager to please” but “overready to condone,” i.e. much the same as complacent. It looks like the final stage in this verbal encounter, with no distinct or neutral identity for complaisant. Writers wishing to use it in the sense of “willing to please” should be advised that the paraphrase is a more reliable means of making their point. \n For complacent there have been two abstract nouns: complacence and complacency. The first (and older) form with -ce is now giving way to the second with -cy. For other examples of this, see -nce/-ncy."

		"title": "complement or compliment, and complementary or complimentary",
		"explanation":"These identical-sounding words represent earlier and later developments of the same Latin word complementum (“something which completes”). The spelling complement still corresponds to that kind of meaning, as in: \n His creativity and her business sense are the perfect complement for running the gallery. \n A similar meaning is the one used by grammarians when they speak of the complement to the verb/noun/adjective/preposition. See further under complementation. \n The spelling compliment which we use to mean “a commendatory remark” comes through Italian and French. This extension of meaning can be explained in terms of etiquette, where a compliment is that which completes or rounds off an act of courtesy. Until C17, the spelling complement represented this sense also, but it has since been taken over by compliment. In everyday writing, compliment is more often needed than complement, and sometimes mistakenly used for it, in both British and American databases. \n The adjective complementary correlates with complement, meaning “that which goes with something else to make a whole.” It typically occurs in analytical writing, as in complementary colors, or two vitally important and complementary goals. By contrast complimentary is an everyday word, correlating with compliment as in the directors were complimentary to us. Complimentary is also the spelling for referring to something given free of charge, such as complimentary tickets to an exhibition, performance or sporting event, or the complimentary bottle of wine from the restaurant which wants you to think well of it, despite a small problem with the main course. The complimentary close at the end of a letter is likewise used to oil the social wheels when corresponding (see Appendix VII). Again complimentary is sometimes used mistakenly for complementary. There’s a particular challenge for American sports reporters in dealing with complementary players as well as complimentary passes (for the game). But the two spellings cause visible problems for other writers represented in CCAE and the BNC, as in complimentary colours and the complimentary hot sauce designed to go with avocados. The databases also show complementary being used for complimentary, as in complementary glass of champagne, or the complementary camera with every travel booking of $1000 or more. This is the more common direction of the mistake, according to New Oxford (1998), which would reflect the fact that complementary is more than twice as common as complimentary, in data from the BNC. But the opposite holds in American English, with complimentary about twice as common as complementary in data from CCAE. "

		"title": "complementation",

This will depend on the verb itself, whether it is copular, intransitive or transitive (monotransitive or ditransitive): see further under those headings. (For complement clauses, see content clause.) \n Not all items found complementing the verb are its complement, strictly speaking. Some grammarians reserve the term complement as far as possible for those items which are required to complete the verb phrase, including: \n ∗ subject complement, as in She is the apple of his eye \n ∗ object complement, as in She thinks him a genius \n ∗ certain obligatory adverbs, as in It costs five pounds; They walked five miles \n This use of complement, to mean something obligatory in a given grammatical construction, makes it contrast with the optional adjunct. See further under adverbs, section 1, and under predicate. \n On the analogy of its use in the verb phrase, the term complementation is now also applied to complementary structures within the noun phrase, adjective phrase and prepositional phrase. Here again the term complement is reserved for obligatory elements, as in \n 1 (noun complement): their reliance on the family \n 2 (adjectival complement): fond of country walks \n 3 (prepositional complement): without the rhetoric \n For more detail on the structure of the noun phrase and its postmodification, see under noun phrase.

In the current English Prayer Book, and in Catholic liturgical books, the spelling is compline. \n The second edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1989), unlike the first, gave priority to compline, and it’s preferred in all modern dictionaries including the New Westminster Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship (1986).

Note the variation in each group (except the adverbs) over the use of hyphens, and spaced or solid setting. Compounds are sometimes said to progress from being spaced as separate words, to being hyphened, and then set solid, but the pattern is far from universal. In American English they may skip the hyphened stage (see hyphens section 1d); and some, especially longer ones like daylight-saving, may never progress beyond the hyphenated stage (in British English, or spaced, in American), however well established they are. Compound adjectives and verbs often go straight to the hyphened or set-solid stage, which ensures that they are read as a single grammatical unit. Noun compounds actually need it less because their structure is underpinned by that of the noun phrase itself. (See further under noun phrases and hyphens.) \n Whatever the setting, the two parts of a compound come together in terms of meaning, and this special integration of meaning makes it more than the sum of its parts. A car park is unlike a national park in almost every way, in spite of the common element park, because both are compounds. For the plurals of compound nouns, see plurals section 2. \n Compounds differ from complex words in that the latter have only one part which can stand alone.

A comprehensive approach (to a problem) takes in almost every aspect of it, just as a comprehensive school is intended to teach subjects right across the educational curriculum, not just the academic or technical strand. But the verb comprehend has for centuries also meant “have a mental grasp of or understand.” The Oxford Dictionary (1989) shows that this is actually the first recorded meaning in C14 English, though the more classical meaning was in use then too. The notion of understanding is the primary meaning for comprehensible (“able to be understood”). Just occasionally comprehensive also shows this development of meaning as well, when used in the sense of “having understanding”: \n  They were not fully comprehensive of the corruption within their ranks. \n Though recorded from time to time over the last three centuries, this usage is not common nowadays – mostly confined to formal style and deliberately lofty writing."

		"explanation":"Comprise is a verb over which many people pause, and three constructions are now acceptable with it.

Between them they offer a stylistic choice between more compact expression (with comprise) or something less dense (with composed of ). But the two seem to be blended in other uses of comprise. \n ∗ comprised of meaning “made up of,” as in: \n The show is comprised of lesser known Spanish artists. \n This construction occurs more freely in American than British English in database evidence. The ratio of comprised of to composed of is about 1:5 in CCAE and 1:11 in the BNC. \n ∗ comprise meaning “combine to make up,” “constitute”: \n Lesser known Spanish artists comprise the show \n This third construction is the mirror-image of the traditional use of comprise. It begins with the parts that make up the whole, rather than the whole which consists of certain parts. Approximately 25% of BNC examples, and more than 75% of CCAE examples use comprise this way, especially for numerical statements, as in: Blacks comprise 60% of the department’s employees. \n The verb comprise is clearly polysemous. Its particular meaning depends on whatever the writer puts as subject of the verb (the whole, or its parts). \n Readers take their cue from that. The second edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1989) recognizes all three uses of comprise, as does Webster’s Third (1986).

It is of course extensively used in reference to trade union organizations (e.g. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions) and also employer groups such as the Building Employers Confederation. Trade union and employer groups in other countries are also designated this way, witness Confederation of Czechoslovak Trade Unions and Swedish Employers’ Confederation. References to political alliances, real or hypothetical, are also expressed via confederation. All these applications make confederation much more familiar and contemporary in Britain than confederacy, whose uses are mostly historical, as in a confederacy of peoples...in the region of the lower Rhine; or the confederacy associated with the Roman Empire. \n In American English, confederacy or rather Confederacy has the high profile in its very specific geo-historical meaning from the Civil War, when the Southern States of the Confederacy (south of the Mason–Dixon line and east of the Mississippi) took on the Union in the north. Those 11 southern states (the Confederacy) still form an identifiable subset of the US in terms of cultural politics, and community groups such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy help to keep it in the public consciousness. The word can also be used generically, as in A confederacy of dunces, the Pulitzer-prize-winning novel by John Kennedy Toole, but the novel’s southern setting makes the connection with the Confederacy more than coincidental. Apart from its inescapable connection with the South, confederacy has a few other historical uses, in references to C18 alliances with American Indians (e.g. the Iroquois confederacy) and early baseball organizations (the Iowa Baseball confederacy). Confederation meanwhile shoulders a burden of generic references to trade, industry and professional groups, as in the national confederation of publishers, a loose confederation of ranchers, miners, loggers, and that electronic confederation called the Internet. In CCAE data, it occasionally appears as part of an institutional title, but much less often than in the BNC. Overall confederation seems to enjoy more general usage in American English than in British. \n In Canadian English, confederation is frequently used as a generic term in place of federation. For Canadians, Confederation has historical significance in refering to the original (1867) federation of the four eastern provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick). The Confederation now connotes all ten provinces."

		"title": "confident or confidant(e)",
		"explanation":"These both relate to confidence: confident (adjective) means “having confidence in oneself,” whereas a confidant or confidante (noun) is one who receives the confidences of others. Originally (up to C18) confident was the spelling for both noun and adjective. \n Although confidante looks like a French loanword, the French themselves use confidente. Their word referred to a conventional stage character who was privy to the secrets of the chief characters. The English spelling of confidant(e) with a is conceivably a way of representing French pronunciation of the last syllable (with stress and a nasal vowel); at any rate it distinguishes it visibly from confident. \n The presence or absence of e on confidant(e) might be expected to correlate with the sex of the person in whom one confided (with confidante for a woman, and confidant for the man). In practice confidant is used for both men and women, as dictionaries and databases confirm. And though confidante is more often used of women in the BNC and CCAE, there’s no lack of counter examples among the British/American data: he was a confidante of Mr Honecker; writer Gus B., the confidante of the New York social set. Some usage writers, e.g. Burchfield (1996), Canadian English Usage (1997), Garner (1998), emphasize the need to use confidante for women only. We scarcely need it at all, given that confidant covers both men and women."

In data from CCAE as well as the BNC, conform to outnumbers conform with by about 5:1. This may seem to vindicate Fowler’s judgement at the turn of the millennium, or rather his influence! But conform with continues to be used, perhaps under the influence of the phrase in conformity with where with is the standard collocation.

		"title": "conjugations",
		"explanation":"The verbs of a language often fall into distinct classes or conjugations according to their patterns of inflection and characteristic vowels. \n In Latin there were five major conjugations, the most distinctive of which was the first with a as its stem vowel. Its descendants in English are the many words ending in -ate, -ator, -ate, -ation and -ative. Most modern European languages have many more than five different classes of verbs, with numerous subgroups created by changes to word forms over the centuries. \n The Old English conjugations involved seven types of “strong” verb as well as the so-called “weak” conjugation, both of which have fractured into small subgroups. Remnants of the strong conjugations still alter their vowels to indicate the past tense and past participle, and often add (e)n to the latter. They include: \n sing sang sung cf. ring, swim \n ride rode ridden drive, write \n bear bore borne tear, wear \n break broke broken speak \n  take took taken forsake \n Verbs of the weak conjugation simply add -(e)d or -t for both the past forms, though some also show vowel changes and spelling changes developed in Middle/ early modern English: \n  live lived lived cf. love, move \n keep kept kept creep, meet, sleep \n  sell sold sold tell \n say said said pay \n Strong and weak elements are now mixed in verbs such as: \n do did done \n shear sheared shorn \n show showed shown \n See further under irregular verbs."

		"title": "conjunctions and conjuncts",
		"explanation":"Though both conjuncts and conjunctions serve to join words together, only the second term is well known. The common conjunctions link words belonging to the same phrase or clause: \n bread and butter white or black coffee \n The passengers were tired but happy. \n Conjunctions also link whole clauses together, as in: \n The baker had bread rolls but there were no bagels left. \n When linking clauses, conjunctions serve either to coordinate them as equals, as in the examples above, or to subordinate one to the other. There are different sets of conjunctions for each type. \n 1 The major coordinating conjunctions are: \n and but or nor yet \n In grammatical terms they link together main clauses (see further under clauses). They appear at the head of a clause, and allow the subject following them to be deleted if it’s the same as the one just mentioned. See for example: \n Marion came and (she) demolished the cheesecake. \n Others saw her at it yet (they) didn’t comment. \n Conjunctions like these can appear at the start of a sentence: \n Others saw her at it. Yet they didn’t comment. \n The “conjunction” thus becomes a conjunct, forging a cohesive link with the previous sentence while being grammatically unconnected. (Conjuncts are further discussed under adverbs section 1; and exemplified in section 3 below.) Grammarians and some teachers have in the past objected to the use of but or and at the start of a sentence, presumably because they recognized them only as conjunctions, not as conjuncts (see further under and and but). \n 2 Subordinating conjunctions serve to link a subordinate clause with the main clause on which it depends (see clauses sections 3 and 4). They include: \n how when where whether why \n  while since as before after \n once till until (al)though if \n because for whereas than \n Complex subordinating conjunctions include:  \n as if as though as soon as as far as \n in case in order that provided that so that \n Many subordinating conjunctions also introduce nonfinite clauses e.g. while dancing, once announced, if chosen. New subordinating conjunctions can evolve out of adverbs, and are indeed in use. (For the status of directly, however, likewise, plus, so, therefore, thus as conjunctions, see under individual headings.) \n 3 The logic of conjunctions and conjuncts. Apart from their role in sentence grammar, conjunctions/ conjuncts relate ideas to each other, helping to show the logic behind the information offered. In fact they express a number of logical relationships – addition, contrast, causation or circumstance (especially time). These logical meanings are embodied in both coordinating and subordinating conjunctions, and in conjuncts and their paraphrases, as shown in the following table. Conjunctions whose status is marginal are shown in parentheses. \n *Addition \n conjunctions: \n and (likewise) nor or (plus) \n conjuncts: \n additionally also alternatively \n besides furthermore likewise \n moreover plus similarly \n too \n phrases: \n as well in addition in the same way \n *Contrast \n conjunctions: \n although but (however) though whereas yet \n conjuncts: \n however instead nevertheless otherwise rather \n phrases: \n against this by contrast on the contrary \n *Causation \n conjunctions: \n as because for since (so) (therefore) (thus) \n conjuncts: \n consequently hence so then therefore thus \n phrases:  \n as a result because of this for this reason on account of this to this end \n *Circumstance \n conjunctions: \n although as (directly) since though when \n conjuncts: \n granted meanwhile next now soon still then \n phrases:  \n at this point despite this even so in that case in the meantime that being so under the up till now circumstances \n The table shows that the same word may signal more than one kind of logical meaning. Either temporal or causal relations can be expressed by as, since, then, depending on the statements they are coupled with. Because they are ambiguous in some contexts, writers need a repertoire of conjunctions and conjuncts from which to choose ones which clarify and underscore logical relations within the argument. Variety itself is important. If thus appears three times on the same page, its use begins to seem decorative rather than logical."

		"title": "connotation",
		"explanation":"The connotations of words are the associations which they raise in the minds of people using them. These associations would be the same for most users: think of holiday or holidays which generally connote pleasure and relaxation – a day out of the regular week, or time out of the regular year for students and many working people. Yet the same word may hold special connotations for individuals and subgroups in the population. For working mothers, the school holidays or vacation raise mixed feelings because the words connote a time when life is actually more complicated. One needs to arrange care and entertainment for the children (and relax with them as far as possible), as well as continue one’s normal working routine. The connotation of words may thus be rather different for speaker and listener, or writer and reader. \n  The connotations of words may also change over the course of time, as with enthusiasm, which is positively valued nowadays, though in C17 and C18 it was a derogatory word – associated with extreme religious emotion. The fact that connotations vary and change shows how unstable they are. By contrast, the denotations of words (whatever they refer to or identify) are relatively stable. So holidays or vacation denote a period of days which makes a break in the normal schedules of work or study. Both students and working mothers would agree on that as the core meaning. Yet some words and especially slang have relatively little denotation, and their chief force is in their connotation. The slang uses of screw as a noun denoting “prison warder” or a verb meaning “have sexual intercourse” are heavy with contempt. The connotations serve your purpose if your aim is to insult, but make them unusable for neutral communication. \n Apart from their positive or negative values, words often have stylistic connotations. Compare read with peruse. Read is the ordinary word for the skill which literate people take for granted; while peruse is the rather rare and formal word used mostly when asking your superior to read or scrutinize a document. Peruse turns reading into a superior activity, commensurate with the boss’s status. A stylistic value is thus also a part of the connotation of a word, and something which can change or become neutralized. Rather formal words (like vacation) and colloquial ones (like flu) now merge with other elements of the standard language."

		"title": "consensus or concensus",

The Oxford Dictionary (1989) registers it as an obsolete variant of consensus, though without citations to demonstrate its use. Current use of concensus in both the UK and the US is confirmed by a number of examples in both BNC and CCAE, though they pale into insignificance beside the thousands of instances of consensus. A Google search of the internet in 2002 nevertheless found concensus in about 1.5% of all instances of the word. The numbers are thus small but pervasive, and the reason for their occurrence is not far to seek – in confusion with census, which is about public information if not public attitudes. The spurious link makes the spelling concensus a folk etymology (see further under that heading).

But it also means “important,” “weighty,” in a consequential congressional leader or a country more consequential than Granada, among various examples from CCAE.

Contagious there has the quite specific meaning of being spread from person to person by physical contact, while infectious simply means “communicable or capable of being spread by any means,” making it the broader term. An Infectious Diseases hospital is concerned with those which are spread by water, moist air, insects etc., not just human contact."

But if there is any such tendency, it probably results as much from the fact that contemporary is an everyday word, while contemporaneous appears most often in academic and abstract discourse. \n Only in C20 has contemporary (as adjective) developed the meaning “modern” or “of our times,” which it does not share with contemporaneous. It appears in expressions such as contemporary theatre, as a substitute for the word modern, which by now sounds a bit old hat. This newer meaning of contemporary occasionally lends ambiguity to statements in which the older meaning could also apply: \n Dickens shares with contemporary novelists a concern with social issues. \n Without further information the reader cannot tell whether C19 or C20/21 novelists are being invoked for comparison. Are they Dickens’s contemporaries, or those of the writer/reader? Note that the noun contemporary is free of this ambiguity, and that, unlike the adjective, it is followed by of: \n Dickens was a contemporary of Thackeray. \n Other points to note: \n ∗ Contemporary has no adverb, but relies on contemporaneous for it: (contemporaneously) \n ∗ The variants co-temporary and cotemporary enjoyed considerable use in C17 and C18, but are now rare.

Compare: \n We hope to come again. \n We hope that they’ll come again. \n The finite that-clause allows a different subject, whereas the infinitive does not. A different subject is however possible with -ing complements: \n I remember that he signed the cheque. \n I remember him signing the cheque. \n I must remember to sign the next cheque. \n As the examples show, the to-infinitive expresses potential action rather than enactment of it."

The noncapitalized form appears in more and less familiar concepts such as continental shelf, continental drift, continental plate, continental lithosphere. \n But for the British, the capitalized form Continental (and the Continent) always means Continental Europe. This usage predates Britain’s membership of the European Union, yet there are hundreds of examples in the BNC to suggest continuing ambivalence about belonging to the European continent. The English Channel is still the watery frontier for touring the Continent and partaking of Continental dishes. The continental breakfast is so well established in English idiom that hotels worldwide use it to identify the quick/inexpensive fast-breaker minus eggs, bacon and all the trimmings of the “full English breakfast.” As that example shows, some lower-case uses of continental also mean “mainland European.” \n ♦ Compare subcontinental."

		"title": "continual or continuous, and continually or continuously",
		"explanation":"The line of demarcation between continual and continuous is no longer so sharp. Dictionary definitions in North America, Britain and Australia show that both are now used in the sense of “nonstop,” the meaning which used to belong to continuous. Their interchangeability on this is evident in BNC examples such as continual stream of persons beside continuous torrential rain. The once distinctive use of continual (“occurring repeatedly, regularly or persistently”) is also increasingly shared by continuous. Even if we put down to hyperbole examples such as continuous criticism from the left of politics, there’s the unmistakable fact that continuous assessment is now standard educational jargon. (In practice, it is continual assessment – luckily for the students concerned. To be assessed repeatedly is bad enough, but to be assessed nonstop would be intolerable.) This and other institutional uses of continuous (continuous monitoring, continuous period of employment, continuous compounding) help to account for the fact that it is much more frequent than continual in BNC data (by more than 4:1). Note also that continuous (but not continual) can refer to the spatial dimension, as in continuous tapering of the blade. \n As adverbs, continually and continuously also have much in common, though their relative frequencies in the BNC are reversed. Again there are examples of continually meaning “nonstop,” as well as “happening regularly.” Compare: \n Payments through the year are not continually accrued \n with \n . . . fingers running continually through tousled blonde hair. . . \n And there’s continuously meaning “happening regularly” as well as “nonstop.” Compare: \n New species arrive continuously \n with \n  I’ve lived in London continuously since 1975. Spatial uses are again exclusive to continuously, as in: The zone extends more or less continuously around the margins of the Pacific Ocean. But the meaning of both continuous(ly) and continual(ly) now depends to a large extent on the phenomena to which they are applied. \n ♦ For the grammatical use of continuous in relation to verb forms, see under aspect."

	{
		"title": "continuance, continuation or continuity",
		"explanation":"Dictionaries in the US, UK and Australia indicate that continuance and continuation may be substitutes for each other, though each has its own centre of gravity. Continuance maintains stronger links with the verb continue, implying an unbroken operation or provision (e.g. continuance of the publishing agreement), or an uninterrupted stay in the same place or position (continuance in office). Continuation often implies resumption after a break, whether in the dimensions of space or time: \n . . . the team’s pathetic continuation of form from the previous season. . . \n Go up Church Road, then Hollyhome Lane, the continuation of it. . . \n The second example shows how continuation comes to mean the physical extension of something. Its capacity to take on more concrete meanings helps to make it much more frequent than continuance in present-day English (by more than 4:1 in the BNC). \n Continuity emphasizes the lack of breaks or disjunctions in something, as for example in continuity of service. The word has assumed particular importance in the audiovisual mass media, where continuity of communication is a point of professional pride. Job titles such as continuity girl and continuity man identify the person who checks that there are no abrupt changes, inconsistencies, or unexplained pauses in the output. The continuity itself is the comprehensive script (for a broadcast) or scenario (for a movie) which details the words, music, sound effects (and camera work) which are going on simultaneously. "

	{
		"title": "contractions",
		"explanation":"In writing and editing, this term is applied to two kinds of abbreviation, detailed below. Punctuation for the first type is much less uniform than for the second. 1. Contractions as shortened forms of single words from which the middle is omitted – e.g. Mr, Dr – as opposed to those in which the end is omitted e.g. Prof., Rev. This difference entails special punctuation practices for some writers and editors, who use a full stop/period with the second type but not the first (as just shown). They also treat foreign abbreviations such as no (“numero”), viz (“videlicet”), vs (“versus”) this way (see No(.)/no(.), versus and vide). An older practice for marking contractions was to use an internal apostrophe to show where the word was condensed, as in C’tee for “Committee,” and especially when it helped to show that the duplicated letter was intended, as in A’asia for “Australasia” (Style Manual, 2002). \n The distinction between contractions and abbreviations was articulated for English by Fowler (1926), though he did not use the word contraction, and it seems to have developed as part of the British editorial tradition after World War II. The Authors’ and Printers’ Dictionary (1938) does not mention it; yet it is acknowledged as common practice in Copy-editing (1975), and shown in copious examples in the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors (1981). Ritter (2002) notes the tradition as well as various inconsistencies that undermine it. Successive editions of the Australian government Style Manual (1966–2002) have maintained it, despite research showing the opposite trend (Style on the Move, 1993). In North America such contractions are known as suspensions, but the practice of punctuating them differently is not widespread. Chicago Manual (2003) mentions it only in passing, and associates it with the British and the French. In Canada the practice is mostly observed in government documents, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). Its anomalous consequences as well as its importance in French editorial practice are noted in Editing Canadian English (2000). So the English-speaking world is far from united over whether to distinguish contractions from other abbreviations by omitting the stop. Second-language users of English canvassed in the Langscape survey (1998–2001) were clearly more inclined than the British to use stops in contractions as well as abbreviations. \n ♦ For a full discussion of the options, see abbreviations section 2. \n 2. Contractions as telescoped phrases such as don’t, I’ll, there’s, we’ve. In all such cases the apostrophe marks the place where a letter or letters have been omitted. Note that with shan’t and won’t, a single apostrophe is all that is used, even though they have shed letters in more than one place. (In C19 English they appeared with two, as sha’n’t, wo’n’t.) \n Contractions like these affect one of two elements in the verb phrase: \n ∗ the word not, when it follows any of the auxiliaries:  \n he word not, when it follows any of the auxiliaries: isn’t wasn’t can’t couldn’t \n doesn’t don’t didn’t hasn’t \n haven’t hadn’t mustn’t etc. \n ∗ the auxiliary itself, especially following a personal pronoun: \n I’m you’re s/he’s we’re they’re (be, present only) \n I’ve you’ve s/he’s we’ve they’ve (have, present only) \n I’d you’d s/he’d we’d they’d (have, past) \n I’d you’d s/he’d we’d they’d (would) \n I’ll you’ll s/he’ll we’ll they’ll (will) \n The last set are sometimes said to be contractions of shall, but this is very unlikely. (See under shall section 2.) \n As the list shows, the contractions from different auxiliaries are sometimes identical, e.g. I’d, s/he’s. But the following verb helps to show whether I d stands for I had or I would. When that verb is an infinitive, as in I’d keep, I’d must be “I would”; whereas with a past participle as in I’d kept, it is “I had.” (See further under auxiliary verb). \n In conversation and informal writing, auxiliary verbs can be telescoped with almost any kind of word or phrase which serves as the subject: a personal pronoun, a demonstrative or interrogative, a noun or noun phrase, and so on: \n That’s going too far. \n There’s a lot more rain coming. \n Who’d want a thing like that?  \n The word’s getting around. \n The king of Spain’s on his way here. \n In just one instance the pronoun itself is contracted: let’s. There were of course others like that in older English, e.g. ’tis, ’twas, ’twere, which now survive as dialectal expression, as in the title of McCourt’s novel ’Tis (1999). \n Contractions like those mentioned above are very common in speech, and appear increasingly in writing, in newspaper columns and magazines across the range from popular to quality press. Contracted forms such as don’t, won’t, it’s and that’s appeared quite often in Westergren-Axelsson’s (1998) study of British publications of the 1990s. In the past they were felt to be too colloquial for the written medium, and editors of academic journals are still inclined to edit them out. The writers of formal documents may feel that they undermine the authority and dignity of their words. But the interactive quality that contractions lend to a style is these days often sought, in business and elsewhere. They facilitate reading by reducing the space taken up by predictable elements of the verb phrase, and help to establish the underlying rhythms of prose. For all these reasons, contractions are used from time to time in this book."

		"title": "cookie or cooky",
		"explanation":"Both spellings have been used for the gastronomic meanings of this word, though the Scottish bun was originally cooky, and the crisp American sweetmeat is almost always cookie. The American use is also familiar to the British, judging by its frequency in the BNC, though in the form of chocolate chip cookies rather than the frozen yogurt cookie sandwich. (The gastronomic potential of the cookie defies imagination!) Canadians and Australians tend to distinguish the cookie from other kinds of sweet biscuit by their shape, which is irregular on top from the fruit, nuts or chocolate chips added to the mixture. \n Colloquial usage has added human dimensions to cookie itself, as: \n 1 a familiar or endearing term for a woman or girl \n 2 a man or person of a specified character, such as smart cookie, tough cookie \n 3 a cook or the cook’s assistant at a camp. This is also spelled cooky or cookee. \n Both human and gastronomic senses are at play in the slogan Smart cookies don’t burn, used by pharmacists in Northern Ireland to publicize a campaign against sunburn. \n In American English, cookie is a productive element in a variety of compounds, such as cookie-pusher (a term for someone in an unproductive service job, whether as a counter attendant or the diplomat who seems to devote disproportionate attention to social events) or the adjective cookie-cutter as in cookie-cutter houses or a cookie-cutter movie (i.e. something which seems stereotypical when it ought to be individual and original). \n The most recent addition to cookie’s range of meanings is as an element of computer jargon. Computer programmers developing interactive software for the internet create a cookie to collect information about the users, which can be stored and read back for further applications."

		"title": "copular verbs",
		"explanation":"Some languages do without them, but English always links the subject and subject complement of a clause with a copular verb (see under complementation).

Compare the following: \n The reception was (very) successful. \n The reception was a successful event. \n The reception went well. \n  Obligatory adverbs of time and place (the reception is here / at 6 pm) often go with copular verbs (Longman Grammar, 1999).

The first two are both used in the description of anatomy: coronary to the crown-like structures of blood vessels, nerves or ligatures around a body organ or part; coronal to the upper section or “crown” of a body structure, such as the head. When used as nouns, coronary stands for coronary thrombosis, and coronal for coronal suture, the serrated line half-way up the sides of the skull. \n The third adjective is a legal development of the Latin root, originating in Australia. Coronial connects with the Coroner, whose name makes him an agent of the Crown. His duties include holding a  coronial court or conducting a coronial inquiry into the causes of death – in which coronal or coronary may also come up."

		"title": "corporeal or corporal",
		"explanation":"As adjectives, both relate to the Latin word for “body” (see next entry), but their applications are quite distinct. Corporeal has the wider range of uses: in theological dialectic where man has both a corporeal and a spiritual; in law (corporeal moveables, corporeal hereditament); in philosophical discussions about the human condition. It finds its way into commentaries on higher and lower forms of art, from Coleridge lamenting that there was a something corporeal in his [Wordsworth’s] poetry, to Jed’s group being on the point of bringing Satan into corporeal existence. \n Corporal leads a much more restricted life, now almost always bound up in the phrase corporal punishment (the striking of another person’s body, usually with an instrument such as a stick or whip, to induce that person to mend his or her ways). Once common as a form of discipline in schools, its use has declined since the 1980s. But its punitive function lingers in the public mind, and because corporal punishment is so similar to capital punishment (“legal execution”) the two get confused – as presumably in the mind of the caller to community radio, who urged that schools reintroduce capital punishment for those who daub graffiti on public walls. \n From malapropism to folk etymology: the noun corporal (“noncommissioned officer”) results from the misspelling of Old French caporal from Italian caporale (a derivative of capo [“head”]), no doubt under the influence of corps (“body of troops”)."

		"title": "corps, corpse or corpus",
		"explanation":"These are, respectively, the French, English and Latin word for “body,” though none of them nowadays refers to the living human form. The oldest of the three in English is corpse, going back to C14. It was earlier spelled corse and corps, and until about 1700 could refer to bodies either living or dead. Only since C18 has it been confined to the dead body, and only in C19 did the final e become a regular part of the spelling. Some explain the e as a backformation from corpses, the English plural of corps; yet many English words were spelled both with and without a final e in the early modern era. \n Corps came from French in C18 with the silent ps of its French pronunciation. It survives in references to organized bodies of people, especially the corps de ballet, the corps diplomatique, and the military unit which consists of two or more divisions. Esprit de corps implies the “common spirit” of a group of people engaged in the same enterprise. \n Corpus is the Latin form which appears only as a specialized word, in law, medicine and scholarship. Its legal use in phrases such as corpus delicti and habeas corpus is discussed under those headings. In medical and anatomical usage it appears in reference to complex structures such as the corpus callosum in the human brain. For scholars, a corpus may be either a collection of works by selected groups of authors, or a database of language material, sometimes homogeneous, sometimes heterogeneous. (See further under English language databases.) \n The word corpus is usually pluralized in English as corpora (its Latin plural form) at least when it appears in scholarly documents. However the native English plural corpuses is often said and occasionally written. See -us section 3."

More lightheartedly, it’s occasionally used to refer to a shapely female figure, as if the Latin delicti were somehow related to the English words delicious and delight. \n The phrase (in) flagrante delicto (“as the crime was being committed”) employs the same Latin word delictum (“crime”). It too is subject to some ambiguity, partly because of flagrante. See further under flagrant or fragrant."

The stress on the second syllable of corral would lead you to expect double l in the inflected forms, and all British writers represented in the BNC use corralled and corralling.The Oxford Dictionary (1989) makes no comment on the verb inflections, curiously, since this usually implies that they are simple and regular. Paradoxically Webster’s Third (1986) gives -lled and -lling as the only inflected forms, yet both spellings are in current American use. They are amply illustrated in CCAE: among 81 instances, the forms corraled/corraling are about 1 in every 3. Their use might be a routine application of the American practice of not doubling final l − except that there’s no hint that Americans stress the word differently, i.e. on the first syllable.

		"title": "could or might",
		"explanation":"These two modal auxiliaries share some uses, most notably that of expressing possibility. Both can express the writer’s opinion about the likelihood of a fact or event – that it was or is possible, or that it may occur in the future: \n They could have been there. \n They might have been there. \n It could be a negative indicator. \n It might be a negative indicator. \n In formal writing, could and might are used this way about equally, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). British writers appeared slightly more inclined to use might, and Americans to use could, in Collins’s (1988) research. But in the Longman Grammar’s conversational data, might is much less used than could in the possibility sense everywhere. \n Might once had a role in requesting permission in polite questions, though this now sounds very self-effacing. Compare: \n Might I have the keys please? \n with \n Could I have the keys please? \n Both might and could are less direct than may or can in questions (see further under can or may). For the use of may have instead of might have in subordinate clauses, as in They said he may have been there, see may or might. \n In conversation could is commonly used to express ability, a role that connects with its origins as the past tense of can: \n When he was younger, he could sing like Caruso. \n This is about twice as frequent as its use to express permission, according to the Longman Grammar. However the ability sense sometimes shades into the other, as in: \n er, as in: Until then, researchers could do surreptitious recording. \n With its several uses, could is more versatile than might, and far more frequent overall. (See further under modality and modal verbs.) \n A curious detail of could is the l in its spelling, which is never pronounced, and only began to be part of its written form from 1525 on. The l was added to bring it into line with other modals should and would, where there are ls for good historical reasons. By a further irony, the l later disappeared from the pronunciation of should and would, so that they now rhyme with could."

		"title": "councilor or councillor, and counselor or counsellor",
		"explanation":"Americans consistently prefer councilor and counselor, which have a large majority over the spellings with double l in data from CCAE. For councilor the ratio is 2:1, and for counselor it’s more than 60:1. The single l spellings accord with the general American practice for final consonants before a suffix (see -l-/-ll-). The different ratios no doubt reflect the less consistent indications of Merriam-Webster (2000), which gives priority to councillor over councilor, but puts counselor ahead of counsellor. For the British, councillor and counsellor are standard according to New Oxford (1998), and they are overwhelmingly preferred in the BNC. Australian English is like British on this, whereas Canadian English positions itself between the British and American. Canadians prefer councillor, but use both counsellor and counselor, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). \n The two words go back to quite separate terms in Latin: concilium (“assembly or meeting”), and consilium (“consultation, plan or advice”). The older meanings are still more or less there in council of war, and wise counsel. But the two words were often mistaken for each other in Middle English, especially with the interchanging of c and s by Anglo-Norman scribes (see under -ce/-se). The idea of consultation passed from the second to the first word, so that a council became not just a meeting, but a consultative and deliberative body constituted to meet at certain intervals. And counsel gained a collective sense, being used for “a group of legal advisers” from C14 on. \n Yet the old distinction between public meeting and private consultation seems to persist in the work of council(l)or and counsel(l)or, and helps to distinguish them. The council(l)or is a member of a publicly constituted body, whereas the counsel(l)or is usually consulted privately for his or her advice."

		"title": "count and mass nouns",
		"explanation":"Many nouns refer to things which can be counted, and so they can be pluralized, witness: \n answers books doctors \n fences offices telescopes \n They contrast with mass nouns (also known as noncount nouns). These are almost always used in the singular because they refer to concepts, substances or qualities with no clear-cut boundaries. For example: \n butter education honesty \n  information keenness mud \n In the singular, count nouns can be prefaced by either a or the, whereas mass nouns permit only the. Compare the/an answer with the information. As the examples show, mass nouns may be either concrete or abstract (see further under nouns). \n Some mass nouns can be used as count nouns under special circumstances. While butter is usually a mass noun, both cooks and supermarket assistants may speak of “all the butters in the fridge,” meaning the various types of butter – salted, unsalted and cultured. This countable use of a noun shows that the count/mass distinction is not inherent in the word itself, but in its use. Quite a few nouns are regularly used both ways, sometimes with different meanings. Compare: \n pare: The lambs suffered in the late frosts. \n  The butcher has no more lamb. \n Knowing which words and meanings are normally construed as mass nouns and as count nouns in British/American English is one of the more difficult points for non-native speakers. Regional varieties of English in Africa and Southeast Asia often permit countable uses of words which would be mass nouns in native-speaker varieties, for example: \n Please put your luggages over there. (Malaysian English) \n Thank you for your advices. (Nigerian English) \n Linguists (Quirk, 1978; Wong, 1982) have pleaded for greater tolerance by native-speakers on this issue."

The more important point to note is that counter should have space after it in compounds such as counter lunch and counter service, where it represents the word counter (“bench or table at which goods are sold”), not the prefix counter-."

Originally a type of carriage, it now means a luxury car which seats only two people, with a long, sloping back aerodynamically designed for speed. However the distinguishing accent is not necessarily there when the word is printed in English texts, and this has fostered a pronunciation of the word with one syllable. It makes it identical with the word used on menus. \n Even stranger, confusion between the two words means that the coupe featured on English menus is sometimes given an accent – just to assure you of haute cuisine. To those aware of the difference, a coupe´ de fruits then suggests the ultimate cornucopia: a luxury sports car used to transport a harvest festival supply of glorious fruits to your table!"

The Oxford Dictionary (1989) records it from the1920s, and Webster’s English Usage (1989) concludes that it has a place in ordinary prose, i.e. prose that does not have pretensions. The briefer American form brings the expression into line with other complex determiners such as a few, and removes it from the open-ended set such as a pair of, in which pair becomes the head of the noun phrase.

The fact that Webster’s Third (1986) puts a hyphen in both the noun and verb forms may well account for court-martial being almost 7 times as frequent as court martial in data from CCAE. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) meanwhile makes court martial the form for the noun and court-martial the verb. However British writers do not necessarily toe the Oxford line, and in the BNC, court-martial appears in about 1 in every 2 instances of the word used as a noun. \n The components of court(-)martial are in French word order rather than English, which is the reason for its traditional plural courts-martial or courts martial (see plurals section 2). In BNC data, almost all of the handful of plurals are courts martial.There is 1 example of the anglicized plural court-martials,which would be “incorrect” according to the Oxford. Both plurals are acceptable in American English according to Webster’s, which registers them as alternatives. Courts-martial is still the preferred form in CCAE data, outnumbering court-martials by 16:1. \n The inflected forms of the verb may be court-martialled or court-martialed, and court-martialling or court-martialing, in keeping with the normal British/American divergence on the doubling of final l.

The word removed means being a generation apart, in either the first or second cousin line of descendants. So A1a/b and A2a/b are the first cousins once removed of B1 and B2 (because B1/B2 have the same grandparents as A1/A2). And if life and time permit, the children of A1a/b and A2a/b would be first cousins twice removed from B1 and B2.

In some parts of the world, crayfish is also used for the marine spiny lobster. Both spellings are effectively folk etymology, attempts to render the Middle French loanword crevis into meaningful English elements. English transliterations from C15 on make fish out of the second syllable, while trying to capture the sound of the first by anything from crea- to crey- to kre- to cray-. The variant crawfish from C17 finds an English explanation for the first syllable, though craw is usually associated with birds. \n Both forms of the word survive in the UK, though crayfish is much more common in BNC data, outnumbering crawfish by about 3:1. In the US, crawfish is the more widely known term, and outnumbers crayfish by about 3:2 in data from CCAE. Crawfish nevertheless has strong associations with Louisiana, so that crawfish etouf ´ e´ (“stuffed crawfish”) comes with New Orleans jazz, so to speak. The greater use of crawfish in American English has very little to do with its colloquial use there as a verb, meaning “back out (of a political position or action).” For example: Do we crawfish?

Yet creditable (and creditably) are less common and more formal words, ones more often written than said, so they seem unlikely targets in impromptu speaking or commentary. \n This colloquial extension of credible as “convincing, impressive” brings it remarkably close to meaning the same as incredible in its colloquial sense,“amazing, impressive.” Not often do a word and its opposite coincide.

Yet having floated to the top (in those days before milk was homogenized) it could be difficult to maintain your distinctive position except by cultivating things French, and creme de la cr ` eme ` makes its appearance in C19, to satisfy that need. To enhance the phrase even further in English, some writers replace the proper grave accents with circumflexes: creme de la cr ˆ eme! \n The French themselves distinguish carefully between creme ` (“cream”) and chreme ˆ (“oil used for anointing”). Both words actually derive from the same medieval French word chresme (“oil for anointing”). But in standard French they have always had different accents, reflecting the belief that they had separate origins."

		"title": "crenellated, crenelated and crenulated",
		"explanation":"All these go back to Late Latin crena (“a notch”), which is the source of French crenel or crenelle (“little notch”) and of neo-Latin crenula. The French words underlie architectural uses of crenel(l)ated, while the neo-Latin word becomes crenulated or crenulate in botany. The shapes referred to also diverge: crenel(l)ated normally implies the squarish pattern of projections associated with castle battlements, whereas crenulate(d) applies to a pattern with rounded projections and narrow notches (as of certain leaves). The spelling alternatives for crenel(l)ated correlate with the usual American/British divide over single and double l (see -l-/-ll-). Only crenellated appears in the BNC, and in CCAE the data runs strongly in favor of crenelated."

		"title": "crescendo",
		"explanation":"This Italian musical term for a rise in pitch is so well established in standard English as to take an English plural. Both crescendos and crescendoes are recognized in Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989), but database evidence from the US and the UK shows that crescendos is now much the more common of the two. (See further under -o.) New Oxford (1998) also lists crescendi, allowing for the musical cognoscenti (see Italian plurals). \n Becoming standard English has also meant extensions to the meaning of crescendo. In the familar idiom reach a crescendo it effectively means “climax,” despite musicians and others who would insist that it only means “ascent towards a climax.” This meaning is registered as acceptable in both the New Oxford and Merriam-Webster’s (2000), and database evidence has it in various constructions, including build to a crescendo and rise to a crescendo. As often, technical terms borrowed from specialized areas acquire new meanings in common usage, and these are not under the specialists’ control. "

		"title": "crevasse or crevice",
		"explanation":"These words are in fact from the same source, the medieval French crevace, but centuries of separation have helped their spellings and meanings to diverge. Crevice meaning “fissure or crack” came into English in C14, as a variant spelling of the original French word. Crevasse entered English only in C19, with different meanings on either side of the Atlantic. In the Deep South (probably on loan from Louisiana French), it’s recorded from 1814 on to mean a “breach in the bank of a river.” A little later than that, British alpine explorers brought back from Switzerland the same word as meaning “deep chasm in a glacier,” and this meaning has spread with crevasse to other parts of the English-speaking world."

		"title": "crime passionnel",
		"explanation":"This French phrase meaning “crime of passion” is not an official legal term, yet it highlights the different treatment given under French and English law to crimes (especially murder) prompted by sexual jealousy. The Encyclopaedia Britannica of 1910 explains it thus: “French juries almost invariably find extenuating circumstances” by which to acquit the murderer. This coincides with an English stereotype of the French: as people for whom the affairs of the heart are paramount. The principle for “crimes of passion” seems to be there in the French Code Penal ´ , article 324, which allows husbands finding their wives in flagrante delicto to shoot them. Whatever the legal issues, English spelling of the phrase is often erratic. Instead of the French spelling (as above), it may appear as crime passionel, crime passionelle and crime passionnelle."

		"title": "criterion and criteria",
		"explanation":"Dictionaries all present these as the standard singular and plural forms for this Greek loanword (see further under -on). Criterion is in fact the less common of the two, outnumbered by criteria by more than 1:3 in the BNC and almost 1:4 in CCAE. Thus criteria is far more familiar for many, a fact which helps to explain its increasing use as a collective or singular noun. This grammatical development has probably gone further outside Britain than within, but the BNC itself contains examples such as capability should be the main criteria and the Government [should] adopt value for money as its criteria. In CCAE data, juxtapositions of the one criteria and the only criteria is clearly show the singular interpretation of the word. In other examples it’s quite ambiguous. How many criteria are at stake in That is a substantial increase by any criteria? For public speakers such ambiguity may well provide rhetorical inflation of what is strictly speaking only one criterion. \n Criteria not uncommonly serves for the singular in conversation, and in research among young Australian adults by Collins (1979), more than 85% treated it as a singular. Webster’s English Usage (1986) has citations for it from the 1940s, from a variety of sources including the advertising flyers of certain well-known educational publishers, mass-circulating magazines and academic journals. It notes also the use of the analogical plural criterias in speech, though not captured in print. Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) also offer criterions as an alternative, but it occurs only once in transcribed speech in the BNC, and not at all in data from CCAE.  \n Though the use of criteria as a collective or singular belies its Greek origins, it would not be the first classical loanword to undergo this shift in modern English. Compare data, media and other Latin loanwords, whose classical plurals also end in -a, and which are also now construed in collective and singular senses. (See further under -a section 2.) The key issue for writers and communicators is to decide whether they want their audience to be aware of one or many criteria – and to spell it out if it is just one. \n The latinized criterium is recognized as a common noun by unabridged dictionaries, and appears in the names of racing competitions from France. Being a latter-day formation, its plural is criteriums as in motor cycle criteriums. See further under -um."

		"title": "crochet, crotchet and crotchety",
		"explanation":"Both these ultimately connect with the French diminutive crochet (“little hook”). Crotchet was borrowed much earlier, and from C15 had its distinctive English spelling for the musical note which is a quarter semi-breve – though not drawn with a hook like the quaver. In this, the English seem to have misapplied the word croche used by the French for the quaver. The term crotchet persists in the UK and Australia, but has been replaced by quarter note in North America. \n By C16 a figurative use of crotchet, having crotchets in the head (i.e. bees in one’s bonnet) had added the sense of “whimsical idea” to the word. This sense deteriorated into “perverse, contrary notion,” whence the adjective crotchety (“irritable, contrary, cranky”). \n The craft of crochet seems to have come into English in the middle C19, and the word appears as both noun and verb. Its French-style pronunciation raises the question of how to spell the inflected verb forms, and whether the t should be doubled or not. Dictionaries all propose the regular crocheted and crocheting. For other French loanwords which raise the same issue, see -t."

They remind us that crude has come a long way in English from meaning “uncooked, raw, unprepared,” which its counterpart in French (cru) still does. This meaning was overtaken in C18 English by figurative senses such as “lacking in maturity and polish” and “lacking in good character and manners,” and these are now dominant in crude and crudity.

Spellings with one l are the only ones to appear in its citations after 1700 (as the absolute form of the word became cruel rather than cruell ). But British editorial preference for the spellings with double l is visible in T. S.

The divergent regional preferences for single or double l are discussed at -l-/-ll-, and for -ise/-ize at -ize/-ise. \n Other derivatives of crystal such as crystalline, crystallography are always spelled with double l, on both sides of the Atlantic, because of their antecedents in French, Latin or Greek."

The forms with -xion were borrowed straight from Latin, and reinforced by common knowledge of Latin. With declining knowledge of Latin, the words have been adapted under the influence of the related verb (connect, deflect etc.). The only word like these which steadfastly remains as -xion is complexion – no doubt because of the lack of a related verb. \n The choice of -ction or -xion doesn’t affect the meaning of the nouns that still allow it.

In military manoeuvres, a cul-de-sac is the difficult position of a force which finds itself checked in front and on both sides, so that the only way out is backwards. In suburban terrain however, the cul-de-sac means a quiet street with no through traffic, the kind of street that urban planners try to build into new subdivisions. \n In French the plural is culs-de-sac, but the hyphens encourage writers to treat it as a compound, and to pluralize it as cul-de-sacs.

In American and Canadian English, all are spelled curb. \n The source of all those meanings is the French word courbe, literally “curve.” The idea of restraint comes from the curb, i.e. curved bit in a horse’s harness. The kerb on the street evolved from the curb which was originally a curved frame or framework around wells and barrels, and then extended to square or rectangular frameworks, including those around trapdoors and along the roof. The spelling for these extensions of the word varied from curb to kirb and kerb – hence the latter for the stone edge that marked the carriageway of improved London streets in C19.

		"explanation":"Getting -ent and -ant in the right places is a problem with a number of English words (see under -ant/-ent); and with current and currant it has meaningful consequences. Most of the time writers want current, which has many more uses in English, as a noun for running water and electricity, as well as an adjective meaning “happening now.” All those senses derive from the Old French word for “running” – corant – though the word was respelled in English according to its Latin antecedent. \n The spelling of currant, the small dried fruit which is the staple of Christmas cakes, has a bizarre history. Currants were originally named as “raisins of Corinth” (the Greek place with which they were associated), and some medieval recipes give their name in full, as raisins de corauntz. Many recipes then reduce the phrase to the last element corauntz, which reflected French pronunciation of the placename. The spelling corauntz had quite a vogue in C15 England, but English cooks often interpreted it as a plural word, as we see from respellings of it as corantes, currants and even currence. (See under false plurals for other examples.) From these, singular forms were derived in C16 and C17, including coren, coran, curran, current and currant. \n The word currant is also applied to quite different plants of the family Ribes, the redcurrant and the blackcurrant, which are shrubs not vines. Their spelling is also insecure, witness the supermarket product labeled redcurrent jelly – an electrifying dish!"

The portentous Latin suggests a document on “the course of one’s life,” something you might present on Judgement Day.

A curriculum vitae begins with a few personal facts, such as age, nationality, marital status, and highest level of education achieved; and then lists the positions you have held, in chronological order but starting with the present. It may help to provide notes on the duties and responsibilities attached to each, if the job titles are less than self-explanatory. \n Curriculum vitae is usually abbreviated as CV without stops. The lower case form c.v. is occasionally used, but always with stops. See further under abbreviations section 2. \n To conform with its Latin origins, the plural of curriculum vitae should be curricula vitae (or curricula vitarum).

But in American English curtsy almost stands alone, judging by the evidence of CCAE, and has become the standard form. \n Through the centuries when curts(e)ying was an important social gesture, its spelling was curiously unstable, even for celebrated writers such as Jane Austen. In fact the word has been steadily distancing itself from its origins in courtesy, and the interim stages are marked in earlier spellings such as court’sy, curtesy and curt’sy. However the spelling curtsey also reflects the common fluctuation between -y and -ey at the ends of some traditional words. For other examples, see under -y/-ey. \n The two spellings support two plurals – curtsies and curtseys – as well as alternative past forms for the verb: curtsied or curtseyed."

Cyclone is the term normally used of whirlwinds which affect lands on the rim of the Indian or south Pacific Ocean. It is a meteorologist’s word borrowed straight from Greek. In the northwest Pacific and China Sea, typhoon is the usual term. Its etymology is much disputed, though it probably owes something to the Chinese tai fung (“big wind”), as well as the Greek monster god Typhon and the Greek word typhon (“whirlwind”). The Greek word is pervasive and seems to have found its way into Portuguese, as well as Arabic, Persian and Hindi; and it is clear that it could easily have been superimposed on the Chinese expression by Europeans who reached the west Pacific. \n In and around the Atlantic, Spanish-derived words for whirlwind are the ones used. Hurricane is the standard term in the West Indies and the Caribbean coastline, and the Spanish word huracan´ mimics a West Indian one for it. Under American influence, hurricane has also spread to the northeastern Pacific and Hawaii. Tornado is a purely Spanish concoction out of their words for “thunder” (tronador ) and “turn” (tornar). It is used by meteorologists of whirlwinds across the Atlantic from Central America to West Africa, but more generally of those that occur within the US, from Tennessee to Ohio.

Yet another, older pronunciation (making it one syllable rhyming with “pace”) is mentioned in Webster’s and the first edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928), but declared extinct in the second (1989). The presence of two syllables is sometimes marked by the use of a dieresis in the spelling: daıs¨ . (See further under dieresis.) \n The meaning of dais has also shifted in the course of time. It is a derivative of the Latin discus, which is the rather surprising antecedent for a number of words for furniture: desco (in Italian) which becomes desk in English, and Tisch (the standard German word for “table”). In Middle English and up to 1600, deis was the term for a “high table” in a hall, and sometimes by association it referred to the platform the table stood on.

		"title": "dangling participles",
		"explanation":"Depending on how and where they were educated, people may be highly sensitive or indifferent to dangling participles (also known as unattached or misrelated participles, where dangling participle was too much of a stimulus to the imagination). Yet another name for the same peccadillo was dangling modifier. \n 1 The dangling/unattached problem. Whatever term is used, the grammatical problem is how an independent introductory phrase stands in relation to the rest of the sentence. In Latin grammar it’s no problem because inflections mark the independence of such phrases (see under ablative, and absolute section 4). English lacks inflections to do this, and so the introductory phrase will seem to modify the subject that follows it, with strange consequences for the meaning sometimes: \n Wondering irresolutely what to do, the clock struck twelve. \n Having said that, it would be a pity to do it too often. \n Now damaged in the stern, the captain ordered the ship back to port. \n Technically there are dangling participles in all three sentences – an opening phrase in each is not meant to be attached to the subject of the following clause, though the grammar may seem to push it that way. In the first example the effect is probably distracting, but hardly noticeable in the second (and third). There are semantic and grammatical reasons for this: the contents of the second example are more abstract; and the opening phrase in the third does relate to the object of the sentence. \n Castigation of “dangling” constructions almost always focuses on sentences taken out of context. In their proper context of discourse, there may be no problem. The dangling participle of the second example (having said that) would have a dual function: to draw preceding arguments together, and to alert readers to an imminent change in the argument. It works as an extended conjunctive phrase (see further under conjunctions). The third example would sound natural enough in the context of narrative: \n The bows of the vessel had been scarred by pack ice. Now damaged in the stern, the captain ordered the ship back to port . . . \n  The narrative keeps the ship in the spotlight – in the topic position in both sentences (see further under topic). Even the first example would be less obvious amid a narrative which puts the hero up front in successive sentences. \n In their respective writing contexts the opening phrase in all three of these examples would have a discourse function beyond the sentence itself. If we rewrite the sentences to eliminate the dangling participles we lose the topicalizing effect they have. Any sentence in which they create a bizarre distraction should of course be recast. But if the phrase works in the context of discourse and draws no attention to itself, there’s no reason to treat it like a cancer in need of excision. \n 2 Established dangling participles. Note finally that some kinds of dangling modifiers are actually the standard phrases of reports and documentary writing. For example: \n Assuming that . . . \n Based on . . . \n Concerning the matter of . . . \n Considering how . . . \n Excepting that . . . \n Given that . . . \n Judging by . . . \n Provided that . . . \n Regarding your . . . \n Seeing that . . . \n Phrases like these are a commonplace way of indicating the ongoing theme or topic of discussion. (See further under information focus and discourse markers.) Even the strictest grammarian is unlikely to insist that the substance of those carrier phrases must be attached to the nearest subject noun – any more than with stock phrases such as barring accidents or failing that."

		"title": "danse macabre or dance macabre",
		"explanation":"This phrase, borrowed from French, refers to the traditional “dance of death” which so fascinated the medieval imagination – the dance in which a skeletal figure leads all kinds of people to their doom. Its power in medieval times derived from the ever-present threat of plague, but the motif showed itself as forceful as ever in Australian “Grim Reaper” advertisements concerning the potential spread of AIDS. \n Earlier forms of the phrase in English, such as daunce of Machabree, show that it was once the dance associated with Maccabeus, the Jewish patriot who led a revolt against Graeco-Roman colonialism in the second century BC. Some suggest that there was a medieval miracle play about the slaughter associated with the revolt. The Dutch Makkabeusdans confirms that the tradition was known elsewhere in Europe. But the name Maccabeus was no longer recognizable in Machabree or macabre´, and instead became confounded with macabre, a word probably of Arabic origin, associated with the gravedigger (maqabrey) and graves (maqabir). The confusion led to the dropping of the acute accent from the word macabre, and to the spelling macaber once found in American English (see further under -re/-er). The phrase is sometimes anglicized as dance macabre (but still with the French word order) according to Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations, and a few in American data from CCAE. It often appears in translation, as dance of death. \n The danse/dance macabre expresses the threat of death in the form of frenzied energy, contrasting with the cold symbolism of the skull, the memento mori (“reminder of death”) which was a subject for Renaissance painters. A third expression of mortality is the Latin phrase dies irae (“day of wrath,” or Judgement Day), from the opening lines of the Requiem Mass."

		"title": "dare (to)",
		"explanation":"This verb is a marginal auxiliary, sometimes construed like an auxiliary with a bare infinitive, or else like a catenative with a to-infinitive following (see catenatives). Compare: \n They dared to speak their minds. \n They dared not speak their minds. \n They didn’t dare to speak their minds. \n In current English, dare with the to-infinitive is used freely in both positive and negative statements. The bare infinitive construction is (a) rare; (b) confined to negative or interrogative utterances: Don’t you dare tell them!, How dare they come here?; and (c) mostly found in British English, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). Elsewhere it survives only in stock idioms such as I dare say. The decline of the infinitive construction correlates with increasing use of do periphrasis, as in I don’t dare, especially in American English. Meanwhile British speakers and fiction writers in the Longman corpus can still make negative statements using dare without do support, as in I dare not. The American preference for do with dare correlates with their greater use of do constructions in negatives and questions generally: see further under do. \n ♦ For other marginal auxiliaries, see auxiliary verbs section 3."

		"title": "dashes",
		"explanation":"The word dash is loosely applied to two types of horizontal line characters in printing: the em dash and the en dash, as they are known in the US and Canada. In the UK and Australia, they are the em rule and en rule. As the names suggest, the em dash/rule is the length of a printed letter m, and the shorter en dash/rule is the length of an n. An en dash is slightly longer than a hyphen, and where all three characters are available, each has its own roles: \n  em dash / em rule - to separate strings of words \n en dash / en rule - to link words or numbers in pairs \n hyphens - in compounds or complex words \n However not all keyboards or wordprocessors have all three; and to compensate, a single hyphen is often used for both en dash and hyphen, and three hyphens (or a spaced hyphen) for em dash. \n 1 The em dash / em rule is used either in pairs, or singly. In pairs they mark off a parenthesis in the middle of a sentence:  \n The most important effect of British colonial development—apart from establishing the tea-drinking habit back home—was the spread of the English language worldwide. \n In the Chicago Manual (2003), the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) and the Australian government Style Manual (2002), the em dashes that mark a parenthesis are left unspaced. Other British authorities such as Butcher (1992) and Editing Canadian English (2000) use a spaced en dash. It provides more separation for the parenthetical elements, and has therefore been used in this book. Whichever convention is used, one pair of dashes is enough for any sentence. Further parenthetical items within the main parenthesis should be marked off by means of brackets or commas. (See further under brackets.) \n A single em dash/rule may be used like a colon, particularly before a summarizing comment which matches the first part of the sentence: \n A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and thou—strictly for intimates! \n But the em dash is also used to indicate a break (or anacoluthon) in the grammatical structure of a sentence: \n A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and—Why are you smiling? \n This use of the dash (em dash) in unstructured writing has earned it a reputation as an informal punctuation mark, but the others are quite standard. \n The two-em dash/rule (two used in quick succession) has several regular uses: \n ∗ to show when the text has been discontinued: \n A loaf of bread, a jug of wine. \n ∗ to show the deliberate omission of (large) parts of a word, as for instance when representing “four-letter words” such as f——, c—— (see also under asterisk) \n ∗ to show where a whole word has been omitted \n ∗ to save repeating the name of an author when it occurs first in successive lines of a bibliography or reference list \n In British style, the two-em rule is spaced in these last two cases, according to Oxford Style. The Chicago Manual (2003) recommends using a three-em dash plus comma or period, according to style. \n 2 The en dash / en rule (unspaced) is used to connect two words or numbers which set up a span between them: \n the Chinese–American alliance \n Sydney–Hobart yacht race \n pp. 306–9 \n 1999–2000 \n Note that where both the en dash/rule and hyphen are available, they can express a difference of meaning: \n  Lloyd–Jones (= a partnership between Lloyd and Jones) \n Lloyd-Jones (= an individual with a doublebarreled surname) \n But in headings and titles consisting of full caps, the en dash is used instead of the hyphen in words that are normally hyphenated. \n GOVERNOR GOES PART–TIME  \n The en dash also serves to link a spaced compound with a prefix, as in quasi–open government policy; or two hyphenated compounds e.g. quasi-expert–quasidisin-terested adviser. \n A spaced en dash/rule is used when the words or numbers to be separated have internal spaces. See for example: \n 1 July 1991 – 2 June 1992 \n In pairs, the spaced en dash/rule is also an alternative to the unspaced em dash/rule for marking parentheses, as described in section 1 above.  \n ♦ For the uses of hyphens, see under that heading."

		"title": "data",
		"explanation":"The fact that data is a plural in Latin (see under -a) has had a powerful influence on its use in English. Writers conscious of its latinity tend to ensure that plural verbs or pronouns are used in agreement with it, as in the following: \n These data were gathered by intensive interviewing. They show . . . \n Plural agreement is still insisted on by many in academic circles, where old scholastic traditions die hard. But in general English usage data also often combines with singular verbs and pronouns, as if it’s conceived of as a collective: \n This data was gathered by intensive interviewing. It shows . . . \n This second version actually expresses something slightly different from the first: it projects the data as a mass or block rather than a set of separable items. Data thereby becomes a mass noun, as noted in the New Oxford (1998), and requires singular agreement. The ratio of singular to plural constructions, as shown by verb and/or pronoun(s) is 4:7 in data from the BNC and CCAE. Both New Oxford and Merriam-Webster’s (2000) note that this singular construction is now as much standard English as the plural. \n The grammatical number of data is often indeterminate because it serves as an attributive or compounding element, in expressions such as data systems, data-processing and data collection. Even as a noun, its appearances are not necessarily marked as singular or plural. To show grammatical number it takes a pronoun such as this/these, or the present tense of a verb such as shows/show or has/have (or the past tense was/were). Other past tenses and modal verbs provide no indication of number. In fact about 80% of the examples in the American and British databases are indeterminate. Very few are so heavily marked for singular/plural by both pronoun and verb as the examples above, and the verb or pronoun which does the marking can be separated by an intervening phrase, or set in the next clause: \n most polling data over the past year has drawn a picture . . . \n . . . finding the data and downloading it \n . . . demand access to unclassified data, and that it be put . . . \n the data that correspond with paper checks. . . \n The separation of data from words that agree with it sometimes shows up where editors have intervened in “correcting” singular forms to plural ones (some but not all!) – suggesting to Webster’s English Usage (1989) that the frequency of plural usage registered in American print owes more to editorial convention than authorial practice. \n In the past, the reluctance to accept singular use of data (while admitting its existence) has been expressed in attempts to confine it to particular genres. Commentators have said that it is restricted to spoken English, or to American English, or to technical English. Burchfield (1996) allows it in computing and “allied disciplines” – whatever they are! The further one investigates, the wider the spectrum of writing in which it appears. Canadian English Usage (1997) observes data with singular agreement in scientific, academic and journalistic writing. Perhaps data will become a purely singular/mass noun like agenda and stamina – Latin loanwords with similar backgrounds. But for the moment it can be construed in either the singular or plural, and writers are taking full advantage of it."

		"title": "dates",
		"explanation":"Depending on where you are in the English-speaking world, dates may be written in more than one order. The two most familiar are: \n ∗day/month/year \n 11 August 1988 - 11/8/88 \n 11th August 1988 - 8.11.88 \n 11th August, 1988 - 11-8-88 \n ∗month/day/year \n August 11, 1988 - 8/11/88 \n August 11th 1988 -  8.11.88 \n August 11th, 1988 - 8-11-88 \n The trend towards using the cardinal 11 rather than the ordinal 11th is worldwide, and used in official correspondence everywhere. But the order of items has yet to be standardized. The first order for dates (d/m/y) works from the smaller to larger unit, and it’s the one used in Britain and Australia. The Chicago Manual (2003) switches its recommendation to the second order (m/d/y) because of its widespread use in the US. But it also notes its ambiguity in the all-number style, and the need for a comma even when the month is named. It still prefers the first order wherever there are multiple dates to be cited. Canadians live with both m/d/y and d/m/y systems, and need to spell out their choice with the first date given in any document. \n The potential for confusion among the all-number styles from each set is obvious, and something which those with overseas correspondents need to be careful about. British letters which give a date as 11/8/88 may very well be misinterpreted in North America, and the dates in letters from North America need to be read with caution elsewhere. The problem never arises, of course, if the month is given as a word, or else as a roman numeral (11.viii.88), a convention used by some Europeans. \n A third possible order for dates is year/month/day: \n 88/08/11 or 1988/08/11 \n This avoids the problems of the other two all-number styles, and it’s the order recommended by the International Standards Organization (ISO 8601:1988[E]). It is already widely used in science and computing, and by international companies based in Europe, and increasingly in the US and Canada. As shown in our example, both month and day are indicated by two digits, with zero filling in the space beside the numbers 1–9. In computer usage the year is given its full four digits, and the date may be set without spaces: 19880811. \n In data systems, a different convention has the day and month combined as a single, three-digit number between 001 and 365 (or 366 in a leap year). According to this system, the date 11 August 1988 would appear as 1988224 or 88224. A space or hyphen can be inserted between the year and the day figure: 1988 224 or 1988-224. The following table shows the range of numbers for each month:  \n January 1 1 \n February 1 32 \n March 1 60 (61 in leap years) \n April 1 91 (92) \n May 1 121 (122) \n June 1 152 (153) \n July 1 182 (183) \n August 1 213 (214) \n September 1 244 (245) \n October 1 274 (275) \n November 1 305 (306) \n December 1 335 (336) \n This method of dating is particularly useful for continuous accounting. \n  Spans of years. When indicating a span of years, a dash (en dash / en rule) connects the two numbers. In spite of shared digits, it’s often necessary to repeat them in the second number. A period between 47 BC and 42 BC would require both numbers to spelled out in full, as 47–42 BC, not 47–2 BC, which might seem to be between 47 BC and 2 BC. For four-digit dates AD within the same century, the last two digits are generally repeated in American and Australian style, according to the Chicago Manual (2003) and the government Style Manual (2002). Thus 1825–29, 1955–58 and so on. However, within the first decade, only one digit is provided: 2003–4. British style, as articulated by Butcher (1992) and Ritter (2002), recommends not repeating more digits than it takes to show the change, thus 1825–9, 1955–8. But they make a special case for numbers between 10 and 19, as in 1914–18 War. The argument is that numbers in that decade (“fourteen,” “eighteen” etc.) are fused rather than separable compounds (compare “twenty-four”). Style authorities everywhere agree that when dates span the turn of a century, e.g. 1898–1901, all four digits should be repeated (and that using 1898–901 would be unfortunate). \n The solidus or slash mark is often used for a financial year or other statutory period (such as tenure of office or sporting season) which does not coincide exactly with one calendar year: 1908/9. It contrasts with 1908–9 where the dash indicates a two-year span of time involving both years. This distinction between dash and solidus then allows us to indicate spans between two financial years, sporting seasons etc.: 1982/3–1983/4. (See further under solidus.) \n 2 Individual years. Writers referring to individual years normally use all four digits: By 1986 we had all graduated. But when speaking, we may allude to a year using just the last two digits – and this form, prefaced by an apostrophe, occasionally finds its way into print, as in the class of ’86. \n ♦ For ways of referring to decades and individual centuries, see under decades and centuries."

		"title": "dating systems",
		"explanation":"Several of the world’s major religions have provided a calendar for dating historical events. The familiar Christian calendar dates things in relation to the putative year of Christ’s birth, AD 1 (see further under AD and BC). The Islamic calendar is based on the year AD 622, when Muhammad fled from persecution in Mecca to Medina, where he began to develop a following. According to this system, events are dated with the prefix AH (= anno Hegirae, “in the year of [Muhammad’s] hegira or flight”). The Islamic years are however difficult to relate to Christian years because they work on a 355-day lunar cycle. Judaism meanwhile calculates historical time in years from the putative creation of the world. Under this system, the years are also sometimes prefixed AH (= anno Hebraico, “in the Hebrew year”), which is clearly a trap for the unwary. Alternatively, dates using this reference point are prefixed AM (= anno mundi, “in the year of the world”). \n Those seeking a dating system which is neutral as to religion have devised the term Common Era, and the abbreviations CE and BCE (“[before] the Common Era”). But contrary to intention, CE is quite often read as “Christian Era,” a misunderstanding which is helped by the fact that the first year of the Common Era is AD 1. (See further under BC.) \n Two other secular systems of dating have had their day. The Romans located historical events in relation to the founding of their city in 753 BC. They gave years with the suffix AUC, which to them meant ab urbe condita (“from the city’s founding”), but is usually glossed nowadays as anno urbis conditae (“in the year of the city’s founding”). In modern times the French Republican calendar was promulgated with the establishment of the Republic in September 1792. It created twelve months, all of thirty days (and five intercalary days), and a new set of names for the months which express the flavor of the season. There’s no mistaking the autumn/winter set and the spring/summer set: \n Vendemiaire (“the vintage”) \n Germinal (“new shoots”) \n Brumaire (“mist”) \n Floreal (“flowers”)  \n Frimaire (“frost”)  \n Prairial (“grass”) \n Nivose (“snow”) \n Messidor (“harvest”) \n Pluviose (“rain”) \n Thermidor (“heat”) \n Ventose (“wind”) \n  Fructidor (“fruit”)  \n The Republican calendar was discontinued with the fall of Napoleon in 1806. \n One aspect of the Roman calendar has been extremely long-lived. We owe to Julius Caesar the system of allowing for a normal 365-day year, plus a 366-day year once in every four. This so-called Julian (or “Old Style”) Calendar continued to be used in Europe up to the threshold of the modern era. By then it was evident that the Julian equation for the solar cycle was a slight overestimate and out by 11 minutes 10 seconds a year. The Gregorian (“New Style”) Calendar modified the old formula by reducing the number of leap years. Instead of allowing that every turn of the century (1800, 1900, 2000, 2100, 2200, 2300 etc.) was a leap year, only one in four was (2000, 2400 etc.). The new system took its name from Pope Gregory XIII, and it has been observed in most Catholic countries since 1582. However the state of religious politics being what it was, England remained with the Julian Calendar until 1752, by which time the British calendar was twelve days behind the rest of Europe. \n Finally, there is a dating system which uses neither sun, moon or climate as its reference, but the known patterns of radiation in carbon atoms: radiocarbon dating. It relies on the fact that the radiocarbon (= carbon 14) in all living things has a known level of radioactivity, which falls off at a predictable rate after the organism has died. The half-life of carbon 14 is 5700 years, and it continues to be just measurable up to 40,000 years. For obvious reasons the method is more useful to archeologists than geologists generally, and has contributed much to the study of the prehistoric environment and relatively recent climatic changes. An Aboriginal footprint preserved in mud near Ceduna (South Australia) was dated as 5470 BP (± 190 years).

		"title": "de-",
		"explanation":"The older meanings of this Latin prefix differ from the new. It came into English through everyday Latin loanwords such as decline, depend and descend, where its meaning is “down or away”; and in ones such as delude, deplore and deride where it means “put down” in a derogatory sense (derogatory itself is another example). \n Its usual modern meaning is to reverse an action: either reducing or lowering it, as in decentralize, de-escalate and devalue; or removing something entirely, as in defoliate, defrost and dethrone. In defuse it may be one or the other, depending on whether the object is a situation or a bomb. This modern usage seems to have developed out of an earlier confusion with dis- (see dis-). In medieval French, words which had originally had de- and those with dis- were both written des-, because the s ceased to be pronounced and people were unsure which words it belonged to. \n The earliest English examples of de- in its negative and privative sense were strictly technical: decanonize and decardinalize amid the religious turmoil of C17, and deacidify and de-aerate out of empirical science in C18. Quite a few modern formations also began as technical jargon: debrief, decontaminate, demilitarize. But there are plenty of examples closer to home: defrost, demist and deodorant. Debug has gone further down the figurative path than delouse. As these examples show, new formations are as often based on nouns as verbs."

		"title": "de facto and de jure",
		"explanation":"The Latin phrase de facto meaning “in fact” or “in reality” comes from the language of law, where it forms a contrast with de jure (“according to law” or “lawful”). Even lawyers have had to recognize that things which have no legal standing are a force to reckon with, and de facto as an adverb has had vigorous use amid the turmoil of English religious and political history. In current British English it most often works as an adjective to mark ad hoc institutions, such as a de facto embassy in Hong Kong, and unofficial or unformulated policies, as in a de facto form of slavery. Occasionally de facto and de jure are juxtaposed, as in the de facto if not de jure standard of the computing industry. But de facto occurs much more often than de jure in reporting and interpreting public affairs, in hundreds of examples in the BNC and CCAE. Americans (more often than the British) use de facto to refer to people in ad hoc public roles, as in de facto president / county executive / press attache´. \n De facto is also used in Australia and New Zealand as a noun and byword for de facto wife or de facto husband – which is backed by the Australian Family Law Reform Act 1980 and written into tax forms and other documents that take account of domestic relationships.

		"title": "Dear",
		"explanation":"The word dear has been used in direct address since C13, and in friendly salutations in personal letters since C15. Dear became the formal opener to any kind of letter during C17, which made it semantically opaque. In institutional correspondence the reader may find it dull or inappropriate (if the letter’s purpose is to demand that you pay supplementary tax). But for those who still write personal letters, it combines with a first name or nickname to make a warm salutation. \n Dear is very strongly associated with paper-based letters, and so seems less natural in e-mail correspondence (see Appendix VII). Those who begin their electronic letters to friends with Dear are definitely a minority – less than 20% in Gains’s (1998) research. It shares the field with “Hi” (20%), and “Hello” (11%). But almost 40% of personal e-mail and over 90% of administrative e-mail had no salutation at all (as in paper-based office memos). Salutations may seem redundant when the message header identifies the person or group being addressed at the start. A small percentage of personal e-mails (less than 10%) began with the addressee’s name alone, as in Tom: did you get the. . . ? Most e-mail messages get briskly down to business, and might be at risk of sounding brusque, but for the mitigating effect of conversational and colloquial idiom (Li, 2000) in the body of the message. The message endings used by e-mail correspondents are also far from standardized, and diverge from those used in paper correspondence: see under Yours faithfully. "

		"title": "debarred or disbarred",
		"explanation":"Dictionaries and usage guides sometimes say these have distinct roles, disbarred being reserved for lawyers expelled from the Bar, and debarred for any other kind of exclusion from a profession, sporting competition, employment and other more abstract arenas. Only in American English does this come close to the facts. The evidence from CCAE is that disbarred is indeed confined to the right to practice law and appear in court; but there are few examples of debarred, and barred seems to take its place. \n In British English, debarred is much more common than disbarred, by a factor of more than 4:1 in data from the BNC. The uses of debarred are many and varied, ranging from the very specific prohibition – railway companies were debarred from acquiring land – to other kinds of prevention: deafness debarred him from lectures. The relatively few examples of disbarred also present a range. Less than half are concerned with exclusion from the Bar, and rather more with being excluded from such things as the armed forces, sports competition and nonlegal professions such as accountancy. An occasional abstract use such as disbarred from making moral judgement also appears among the data. \n This wider range of uses for disbarred has its explanation in the fact that there are actually two verbs written as disbar, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). The older one, labeled “obsolete,” is a C16 variant of debar, based on its French antecedent desbarrer, with the general meaning “exclude.” The younger disbar (“expel from the Bar”) is a C17 creation. The New Oxford (1998) takes the radical step of putting the two disbar verbs together, allowing that the older usage has indeed continued, and giving disbar both legal and nonlegal definitions. But amid this expanding range, the exclusions expressed by debarred and disbarred don’t yet prevent drinkers from consoling themselves at the local bar."

In the countdown to the new millennium, speculation mounted about how we would refer to the first decade of C21, with the “oh-ohs” and the “noughties”/ “naughties” (see naught) as light relief from the plainer “twenty hundreds” or “two thousands.” The latter was strongly preferred in an Australian survey (Peters, 1999a), and its potential ambiguity is no problem while the century has yet to unfold.

		"title": "decimate",
		"explanation":"In contemporary English decimate has been acquiring new uses, none of which is mathematically precise. Its Latin meaning was exact – “reduce by one tenth” – and in earlier English it was similarly used, as a classical synonym for the Anglo-Saxon word tithe (“take one tenth of a person’s goods, as a levy or tax”). On rare occasions, the word has also been used to mean “reduce to one tenth” (i.e. by nine tenths). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) demonstrates this for decimation, with a citation from the C19 historian Freeman. He spells out his meaning with the aid of the 9 10 fraction – evidently anticipating some uncertainty about the word. It tallies with the Oxford’s C19 note on the use of decimate to mean “devastate or drastically reduce,” which it dubbed “rhetorical and loose.” We may read between the lines that there was some kind of shibboleth about it, fostered by more widespread knowledge of Latin. But this meaning is nowadays the commonest use of the word in both British and American English, and it’s registered without comment in modern dictionaries. With the sense of “reduce drastically,” the word appears in many contexts, witness the following from BNC and CCAE: \n . . . communities decimated by AIDS \n Torpedo bombers decimated the Italian fleet. \n ...housing programs decimated in earlier budgets Honda decimated the British motorcycle industry.  \n . . . drought that has decimated bird and fish populations \n The Communist Party saw its parliamentary representation decimated. \n Among the citations, the mathematical meaning remains only as a distraction – as when we’re told that there are now about 18,000 elephants left in Kenya, thanks to poachers who have decimated the population by 70,000 a year since 1979. Using exact numbers with decimate is ill-advised, whatever its intended sense. They are redundant where it means “reduce by one tenth,” and where it doesn’t they confound the arithmetic. Precision mathematics is certainly not the point when decimated features in sports reporting, as it does on both sides of the Atlantic: \n Thompson decimated the Christleton bowling. . . . the Huskies have been decimated by injuries \n Yet other developments of decimate seem to be American rather than British English. Only in CCAE is the word found to mean “raze to the ground” as in lava has decimated their homes or soldiers decimated entire villages or the ironic urban renewal decimated the area. Also on the frontiers of decimate are instances of emotional and personal devastation: a man decimated by the loss of his wife, and another decimated by drug and alcohol abuse. Decimate is thus becoming a general-purpose synonym for “devastate,” though not yet acknowledged in Merriam-Webster’s (2000). \n Whatever destruction, damage or disaster it’s applied to, decimate remains ominous, always expressing a sense of disquiet. Dark connotations have been at the heart of the word since Roman times, when it referred to the punitive measure practiced by the Roman army – the killing of one soldier in ten, as a reprisal against units which mutinied or showed cowardice. The mathematical precision of that meaning has been lost, but the sinister implications are still there."

The following are examples of nominative and accusative forms of each: \n first declension: domina dominam “woman” \n second declension: deus “god” deum \n third declension: miles “soldier” militem \n  fourth declension: manus “hand” \n manum fifth declension: dies “day” diem \n Older Germanic languages such as Old English and Old Norse had numerous noun declensions within the two major groups, known as “strong” and “weak.” In modern German there are up to sixteen declensions, according to the paradigms in the Langenscheidt Dictionary (1997). Most Germanic languages either have or have had different declensions for their adjectives, also often referred to as “strong” and “weak.”"

This spelling was “rare” in C19 according to the original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928), which gave the regular English form deductable as the primary form. But the latinate deductible has gained ground since then, according to the Oxford’s second edition (1989). It dominates in data from the BNC and CCAE, by more than 60:1. Deductible is the only spelling listed in Merriam-Webster’s (2000), New Oxford (1998) and the Canadian Oxford (1998), but the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) presents deductible and deductable as equally current.

		"title": "deduction",
		"explanation":"This word is often loosely used to refer to any kind of argument. But in logic it denotes a particular kind of reasoning, a process in which a conclusion is drawn after certain premises have been established. Provided that the premises are true, they guarantee the validity of the conclusion. Deductive arguments contrast with inductive ones, in which the premises can only be said to support the conclusion (see induction). \n One of the best known forms of deduction is the syllogism, in which a conclusion is drawn from a pair of premises. For example: \n All mammals suckle their young. (major premise) \n Whales are mammals. (minor premise) \n Therefore the whale suckles its young. (conclusion) \n The validity of the conclusion depends on (1) the validity of both premises, and (2) the fact that the class of things introduced in the minor premise is included in the class of the major premise. The class which links the major and minor premise is known as the middle term. \n Similar deductive arguments are commonly used in establishing a scientific theory and making predictions from it. They involve setting up and testing a hypothesis which is conditionally asserted within the major premise. The two well-recognized types of argument like this are the modus ponens and the modus tollens. The following illustrate the two types. \n 1 Modus ponens \n If there’s an inverse relationship between IQ and the number of siblings in the family, then brighter children will come from smaller families. \n Bright children typically come from smaller families. \n Therefore there’s an inverse relationship between IQ and the number of siblings in a family. \n With the modus ponens argument we can assert the antecedent as the conclusion. \n 2 Modus tollens \n If there’s an inverse relationship between IQ and the number of siblings in a family, then brighter children will come from smaller families. \n Bright children don’t all come from smaller families. \n Therefore there cannot be an inverse relationship between IQ and the number of siblings in a family. \n The modus tollens argument is the negative counterpart of modus ponens, and works by denying the consequent as the conclusion. \n The two patterns of argument may be symbolically represented as follows: \n 1 Modus ponens - If p then q p therefore q. \n 2 Modus tollens - If p then q not p therefore not q. \n The letters p and q stand for indicative statements (see further under indicative). The modus tollens provides the logical framework for testing the null hypothesis, used in statistics and much research in the behavioral and social sciences. \n Deductive arguments are sometimes referred to as a priori arguments. See further under that heading."

Defective is used of objects which have detectable flaws, or do not function properly because of missing or damaged parts. Deficient expresses a more abstract problem, where there is less than the full complement of a standard quality or attribute. Because of its abstractness, deficient is usually qualified in some way, such as “deficient in sensitivity.” \n With their different applications, the two words rarely cross paths in usage – only where a problem can be identified in either concrete or abstract terms, as in mentally defective (= impaired brain function) and mentally deficient (= insufficient brain resources). In fact mentally handicapped is far more common than either of them, in American and British databases.

The British (Canadian, Australian) preference for defence seems to have intensified during C20, and it’s the dominant spelling in the BNC by more than 500:1. Yet defense also appears in the data, not simply in references to the US Secretary/Department of Defense. Other organizations round the world with Defense in their title act in defence/defense of such things as the environment, natural resources, flora and fauna.

Canadians accommodate the stopped style as well as the unstopped (B.A. or BA). British and Australian style is generally unstopped.

(The reverse process is described at -y > -i-). \n escribed at -y > -i-). Demi- is synonymous with semi – from Latin and hemi- from Greek, and all three are brought into play for subdividing the length of musical notes in British (and Australian) terminology. Thus the demisemiquaver is one quarter the length of a quaver, and the hemidemisemiquaver one eighth of it – a long word for a very brief sound. But North American musical nomenclature does without quavers (and crotchets), and names all notes as fractions of the semibreve. So the demisemiquaver is a thirty-second note, and the hemidemisemiquaver a sixty-fourth note. \n Demi- lends ambiguity to demivolt, unless you happen to have some knowledge of electricity and/or dressage.

Yet in contemporary English, demise often refers to the decline of an institution, custom or fashion. This is the dominant sense in data from both the BNC and CCAE, as in: \n communism’s demise in Eastern Europe \n the local barbershop’s demise \n the void left by the demise of the afternoon edition \n the demise of three square meals a day \n Another, more ambiguous extension of the word is to refer to the departure of politicians from office, and the retirement of others from the public arena. It happens when what might be referred to as political demise or professional demise is just called demise. For example: \n . . . a rebellion within military ranks triggered Marcos’s demise \n Alan Bond’s demise is a parable of the last 10 years. \n Evidence of demise used to mean “loss of position or status” comes from both American and British databases, and it’s recognized in Merriam-Webster (2000) though not in New Oxford (1998). But this use of demise (without any indication that it means political/professional demise) is safe only in the short term and with readers who know that the person is not yet dead. Otherwise the more deadly possibility will be there to confound their reading of the text. In the longer run, demise in the sense of “death” will win out anyway.

While dependent is indeed the common form of the adjective, dependant serves about equally as noun and adjective. Compare: \n carers with a dependant in their household \n with \n more dependant on aid than ever \n and \n co-operation between mutually dependant classes \n Still the fact is that adjectival uses of dependant are much less frequent than those of dependent. \n In the US dependent is simply used for both adjective and noun.

The facts are that it’s not perfectly observed in the UK, and disregarded in the US. Those who use dependant for the adjective do not cause misunderstanding, since the grammar is always clear from the context, as in the examples above. This being so, one might ask why British dictionaries could not accommodate it – in the name of Johnsonian variation or American liberalism, according to taste.

But the word can take on the more figurative meaning of “represent as having little value, belittle,” and it then comes close to the extended meaning of deprecate. Deprecate is essentially “argue against,” but by extension means “disparage,” as in The movie star deprecated his acting talent. \n This is why deprecatory comments and depreciatory comments mean much the same, and compounds such as self-deprecatory/self-deprecating and self-depreciatory are indistinguishable.

Derisory attaches itself to the object of derision: \n It was sold at auction for a derisory sum. \n Derisive meanwhile is the attitude of those mocking: \n The derisive laugh challenged their complacency. \n Thus derisory is a synonym for “laughable,” and derisive for “mocking.” \n This neat division of labor works – more or less – in British English, where the two words are about equally common. Derisive is almost always used to mean “mocking,” though derisory appears in this sense in more than 10% of the BNC citations, as in a derisory laugh, the derisory song, and derisory calls from the crowd.

Prescriptivists, whether they are experts or ordinary citizens, usually plump for the traditional form, whereas descriptivists recognize that language changes, and allow that there may be a choice of forms in certain contexts. \n In the history of English, language commentators have swung from being typically descriptive in C16 and C17, to prescriptivism in C18, and later C19 and earlier C20. Under the influence of modern linguistics, more descriptive approaches were taken up – especially in the US – during C20. They go hand in hand with better understanding of language change, and better tools for describing it. A third factor is the generally more democratic climate of thinking, which allows that common usage and trends within it are really more powerful in language history than abstract notions of what is correct or “logical” in English. This principle was articulated in Roman times by the poet Horace in the comment “the arbiter, law and standard of speech lies in usage” (Ars Poetica lines 71–2). Horace’s words were known to and quoted by C18 scholars, yet the idea that common usage should influence judgements about language was little developed in their publications. \n Dictionaries and style guides of C20 have varied in their stance, though generally speaking, the smaller the volume the more likely it is to work prescriptively. You need space to offer the full descriptive detail on usage. Even larger volumes may resort to prescriptivism in the absence of linguistic evidence, a point which is not always obvious to the reader (Peters and Young, 1997). It must be said that some people expect prescriptive judgements on what is “correct” and “acceptable,” as simple answers to language issues. This C21 book endeavors to provide advice through descriptive information on usage, derived from primary and secondary sources. It indicates where particular variants are preferred, and the stylistic contexts with which they are associated – assuming that interested and intelligent watchers of the language would rather have the wherewithal to choose, than have choices made for them."

		"title": "desert or dessert",
		"explanation":"The crux presented by these arises out of the several words that can be represented by desert. \n 1 With stress on the first syllable, desert is a common noun meaning “sterile dry place,” and an adjective meaning “deserted,” as in desert island. These derive via French from the Latin desertum (“deserted” or more literally “unbound”). The verb desert as in deserted his wife (with stress on second syllable) also comes from the same source. \n 2 The archaic noun desert means “what you deserve,” and survives in the phrase get one’s just deserts. This word is based on the past participle of Old French deservir, meaning “deserve.” \n The noun dessert (“sweet course of a meal”) sounds exactly like desert (2), but the double s connects it with the French verb desservir, meaning “clear the table” and thus makes it the last course of the banquet. Only rarely do dessert and desert (2) cross paths and create ambiguity. But it’s worth asking what kind of sweet course you expect at the end of a meal, if you get your just deserts!"

Combinations of determiners most often involve quantitative words, as in all the people and both my dogs. The first determiner in such structures becomes the predeterminer. Other words which can be predeterminers are such and what, which can combine with the indefinite article as in such an experience, what a business. Combinations of three determiners are also possible, though uncommon. They involve both cardinal and ordinal numbers, as in the first two students or the two first students.

		"title": "dialect",
		"explanation":"Dialects are most obvious in the distinctive speech sounds of a particular region, in the “Deep South” vowels of those from somewhere between Texas and Tennessee, and the “burr” of Scottish speakers of English. Within large cities, dialects can be the hallmark of particular communities, for example the Cockney of East London, and of Brooklyn or Harlem in New York. These dialects consist not only of different accents, but also of words, idioms, and sometimes grammatical patterns that are distinctive to the region or social group. \n All aspects of dialect may impinge on writing, depending on the subject and nature of the discourse. In Wuthering Heights, the Yorkshire dialect vested in the puritanical servant Joseph is used to anchor the novel in the bleak northern regions of England: \n “Sabbath no o’ered, und t’sound o’ t’gospel still i’ yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!” [The Sabbath isn’t over, and the sound of the gospel still in your ears, and you dare to play!] \n The author of Huckleberry Finn uses a range of dialects to locate the novel, though dialectologists disagree about how many. The most salient are the two used by Huck (South Midland white dialect) and Jim the runaway slave (Southern black dialect), which serve to remind readers of the socio-ethnic divide among Americans. Regional pronunciations and nonstandard grammar are evident in speech attributed to both, though more consistently in Jim’s utterances: \n “Yo’ ole father doan’ know, yit, what he’s a-gwyne to do. Sometimes he spec he’ll go’way, en den agin he spec he’ll stay. . . ” [Your old father doesn’t know yet what he’s going to do. Sometimes he expects he’ll go away, and then again he expects he’ll stay.] \n Huck’s narrative blends standard with dialectal American English: \n “You don’t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of Tom Sawyer, but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things that he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another. . . ” \n  Dialect serves several purposes in the novel, bringing its characters to life, while locating them in the Mississippi region, and connecting them with the larger social parameters of the setting. \n Nonfictional writing is much less concerned with individual voices, and offers less scope for dialect. Yet the use of regional terms, e.g. sidewalk rather than pavement, will associate the document and its author with the North American continent rather than Britain. Regional spelling variants such as plow/plough can have the same effect – and seem to include or exclude readers, according to where they are coming from. Writers naturally choose the local word or form if their text is to be read within their own region (say the UK or US). The choice is more difficult for those wanting to communicate across regional boundaries, in which case they need to consider the most “international” option available. A familiar colloquial term may prove quite mysterious beyond its own region, however well it speaks to readers within it. The computer manual which refers to a binary switch as a teeter-totter will lose readers outside the dialect areas of the US and the UK where it’s the regular term for “seesaw.” Even standard English terms can pose a dilemma for writers looking to international audiences. The Australian playwright David Williamson had to retitle his 1974 drama The Removalists as “The Moving Men” for its New York production. In London, it had to be “The Removal Men”. \n Any questions about the “internationality” of words and phrases can be explored with the help of larger dictionaries, where US/British alternatives are mentioned for particular words. Some learners’ dictionaries do it systematically, notably the Cambridge International Dictionary of English (1995), from which dialect-free options may be extrapolated. But entries in this book explicitly indicate an international English selection wherever possible – the option which is regionally neutral and/or accessible to the broadest spread of readers. See further under international English and standard English."

Dialectic originated with Socrates and Plato, but it was given new life by Kant and Hegel in the modern era, and subsequently adapted by Marx in the philosophy of dialectical materialism. A more recent extension of the noun dialectic makes it simply a way of referring to the tension between two opposing forces, such as church and state, without any philosophical implications. This usage is likely to irritate those with any knowledge of philosophy, and to intimidate those without it."

		"title": "dieresis or diaeresis",
		"explanation":"This is the term for a diacritic used only sporadically in written English. It consists of two dots placed above a vowel, and thus looks rather like the German umlaut. The di(a)eresis indicates when the second of two successive vowels is pronounced separately, as in naıve ¨ and waiver. These days it is used primarily in proper names such as Aıda, Chlo ¨ e¨ and Noel, ¨ and sometimes also Bronte,¨ to emphasize the second syllable. In earlier centuries it was also used to show the scansion of common nouns in editions of poetry. \n The spelling variants dieresis/diaeresis reflect the standard American/British variation in the treatment of Greek diphthong ai or hai (see further under ae/e). In Greek di(a)eresis meant “division,” “separation,” based on the prefix di- (i.e. “two”) and the verb hairein (i.e. “take”, “choose”). A much more familiar derivative of the same verb is heresy (a separate division of the faith), where the key vowel has long since been spelled with plain e. The American dieresis is in line with this evolution, whereas the British diaeresis preserves the classical root in neoclassical form. With the ae ligature untied to make a digraph, it makes an ambiguous and cumbersome sequence of vowels. See further under ligatures."

In American English however the weight of usage is behind dietitian, and it outnumbers dietician by more than 7:1 in CCAE. With its two ts, dietitian has a clearer link with dietetics, and this may well have helped to secure its position in C20. \n Dietician was endorsed by the original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) as the “proper” spelling, on the analogy of physician and politician. Yet uncertainty over the form of the noun was probably fostered by the variety of adjectives related to diet: dietary, dietic, dietical, dietetic and dietetical. The ones ending in -ical have dropped out of use, according to the Oxford Dictionary, and dietic does not seem to be current.

		"title": "different from, different to, and different than",
		"explanation":"All three constructions have a long history of use, dating back to C16 and C17. Yet much ink has been spilled over their relative correctness, with insufficient attention to their contexts of use. Consider what you would do in the following: \n 1a Bob’s approach was different . . . Jo’s. (from?/to?/than?) \n 1b Bob’s had a different approach . . . Jo. \n 2a Bob’s approach was different . . . what we expected. \n 2b Bob had a different approach . . . what we expected. \n 3a Bob’s approach was different . . . we expected \n 3b Bob had a different approach . . . we expected. \n Whatever you do in the first two pairs, there’s a strong chance you will choose than in the third pair. This is because sentences 3a and 3b require a conjunction, and from and to are essentially prepositions. Those who have learned to shun than after different will avoid it in 3a/b by rewriting them along the lines of 2a/b, where either from or to can be used. Yet the use of different than in sentences like 3a/b is standard in American English, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), and widely accepted in British English, according to the Comprehensive Grammar of English (1985), whenever a clause or its elliptical remnant follows (as in sentences 1b or 3a/b above). Data from the BNC shows multiple examples of than preceding what in type 2 sentences also. These uses of different than are frequent in Canada, according to Canadian English Usage (1998), and in Australia (Peters, 1995).  \n When choosing between different from and different to for constructions like 1a (with a simple noun phrase following), British writers are most likely to write from – by about 6:1, according to the evidence of BNC. For American writers the prime choice is between from and than, which appear in the ratio of 4:1 in CCAE. Different than is thus not the most frequent collocation, even in American English, but it’s freely used in constructions like 1a, and probably gaining popularity (Hundt, 1998). Americans make little use of different to. Overall the corpus data confirms that grammatical issues are more important than regional differences, in deciding what to collocate different with. Only in the case of 1a (and the use of to) is it strictly a matter of British/American divergence. \n The etymological arguments used to support different from no longer seem so powerful. The fact that different embodies the Latin prefix dis- (“away from”) does not require the use of from after it, any more than with averse (see adverse or averse). There are natural English parallels for to in collocations such as compared to and similar to, and for than in comparatives such as better than or worse than. The verb differ itself combines with other prepositions/particles, for example differ with (“disagree”), and so provides only qualified support for using from. Different from has no exclusive claim on expressions of comparison. Writers and speakers everywhere use different than as well, depending somewhat on the grammatical context."

		"title": "differently abled",
		"explanation":"This expression has been cultivated in some quarters to refer to persons with a handicap, either physical or mental. It circumvents adjectives such as disabled, handicapped, crippled, all of which seem to characterize the person in terms of malfunction or deficiency. Differently abled seeks to provide an affirmative alternative, to encourage members of the “abled” population to appreciate the different skills by which those with a disability manage their daily lives. \n The intention behind differently abled is thus laudable and supportive of those who often suffer from negative stereotyping. But the phrase itself is not widely used – just a handful of examples in CCAE data, and 1 only in the BNC. Its form goes against it, with the polysyllabic adverb positioned up front. The usual position for differently is to follow the verb, in database examples such as angled differently, treated differently, understood differently. \n Affirmative action is necessarily disturbing to the status quo, and linguistic affirmative actions of this kind do encounter resistance and ridicule. Parodies such as differently advantaged (living in poverty), differently pleasured (sado-masochistic), differently qualified (incompetent), satirize the gap between language and reality, and expose the euphemism.

But when it comes to emotions, either defuse or diffuse can be used, witness defuse strong feelings and to diffuse ill-feeling, among various examples from the BNC. In other applications, the two also converge. \n The shock of these artists’ social criticism is defused. \n Potential wars were diffused with the development projects. \n In such cases, the outcomes of these verbs are much the same, whether the metaphor is that of scattering light or dispersing heat.

Assumptions about typography, such as the use of italics, and of serif versus sanserif fonts, need to be reconsidered (see italic(s); serif). The visual structuring of text becomes more important, hence the increased use of headings and vertical lists, to make information more “scannable.” With lists come the regular use of bullets (see bullets), which need to be recognized as part of our punctuation system, along with the white space that complements each bullet at the end of listed items. \n Digital communication via keyboard and screen has generated new media (e-mail, text-messaging) which tend to compact language (see SMS), and make use of conventional symbols to convey attitudes (see emoticons). There’s no suggestion that these abbreviated codes of communication will replace standard English, despite their popularity and effectiveness when the space to communicate in is very small.

		"title": "digraph or diphthong",
		"explanation":"Only the first of these words really relates to writing. A digraph is a pair of letters which represents or corresponds to a single sound, such as both the ch and the ie of chief. As these examples show, digraphs have their component letters set apart, whereas those of a ligature join together to form a single character. In earlier phases of English printing, letter combinations such as ct and ae were ligatures (ct and æ), but in modern print they are normally set as digraphs. (See further under ae/e and oe, and under ligatures.) \n Diphthongs are sounds which contrast with pure vowels in that they have the quality of more than one vowel. Pure vowels are pronounced with the tongue held momentarily in one position, whereas diphthongs are moving vowels, pronounced by a tongue which is in transit from one position to another. This gives diphthongs their dual character, which explains the prefix di- (“two”) embedded in their name. The Greek word phthongos (“sound”) is the second element, spelled with three of the digraphs of modern English. \n Note that “dipthong” is a relatively common pronunciation of diphthong, recognized in North American dictionaries (Webster’s Third, 1986, and the Canadian Oxford, 1998), and in the UK by Collins (1991) but not New Oxford (1998).

		"explanation":"These spellings represent two different words: \n 1 a water channel and embankment \n 2 a lesbian. \n British English prefers to use one spelling for the two words, but tradition and usage diverge on which it is. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) prioritizes dike for both, which is eminently reasonable for the first word, since it’s a variant form of ditch. The origins of the second word are unclear (or unprintable), and for it too Oxford prefers dike over dyke, and for the associated adjective dikey over dykey. Its reasons are not explained, though they may be grounded in the fact that many words which vary between i and y in the end revert to i (see i/y). A handful of British writers in the BNC use dike for either word, but the great majority use dyke, and this usage is reflected in the New Oxford’s (1998) preference for dyke (and dykey). Either way, British English supports convergent spelling for the two key words. \n American English goes the opposite way, differentiating the two words by means of the two spellings. Webster’s Third (1986) makes dike the primary spelling for “embankment,” in keeping with etymology and the original Oxford, and it gives dyke (and dykey) as its preference for “lesbian.” These preferences are endorsed by American writers represented in CCAE. They make regular use of dike for “embankment,” confirming it in numerous placenames, and use dyke for “lesbian” on its (rare) appearances. \n British writers will thus coincide with American English on one but not the other spelling, depending on which of the two British practices they observe. The alternatives are pretty well known, yet sensitivities may be aroused because of the particular application of dyke in the US. This makes it a non-trivial spelling issue for international communicators."

North American dictionaries (Merriam-Webster, 2000, and the Canadian Oxford, 1998) prefer dilettantes over dilettanti, and pronunciations with three rather than four syllables. New Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) do the opposite, preferring the Italian plural and four-syllabled pronunciations. Whether this seems dilettantish or evidence of dilettantism depends on your point of view. But the existence of those derivatives suggests that it’s high time to treat dilettante as an ordinary English word."

		"title": "dinner",
		"explanation":"Everywhere in the English-speaking world, this word can raise uncertainties about the sort of meal it refers to. While lunch is clearly a midday meal, and supper one in the evening, an invitation to come to dinner at the weekend can pose a delicate dilemma until an exact time is mentioned. \n There are two things at stake. Working people usually have their main meal in the evening, and so from Monday to Friday, and Saturday as well, dinner would be eaten with the setting sun, so to speak. On Sunday however, dinner used to be the ample midday meal to which many returned from their morning church service. But with changing habits in both eating and church-going, the “Sunday roast” tradition has vanished, and “Sunday dinner” is more and more an evening meal as on other days of the week. \n Apart from the question of eating habits, the word dinner has had connotations which would be sought by some and avoided by others. It has always been the word for the formal meal arranged for a special occasion, but is also used on a regular basis by many. In the UK, dinner is preferred by U-speakers (see U and non-U), though it may seem pretentious for those lower on the social ladder. Their natural word would be tea, which still denotes the main meal of the day – not just a pot of tea and scones – within many British and Australian families. Supper is used by Americans and Canadians for the homely evening meal (and also in the UK). But for Australians supper is a late evening snack. Where lunch is concerned, the Englishspeaking world is in solid agreement that it refers to a midday meal, which may be light or quite substantial. See lunch or luncheon."

		"title": "dint or dent",
		"explanation":"Both these go back to an Old English word for a “forceful blow,” whence also its use to mean an “impression,” typically on metal. Where the dint/dent was once a sign of enemy impact on your suit of armor, it now records an unfortunate encounter between your car and another solid object. For this or any other hollow or impression made in a surface, dent is the usual spelling in both the US and the UK, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. Dictionaries also allow dint, but it’s rare in the databases, and more often heard than seen. As a verb dent is mostly used in the passive, as in the barge’s hull was dented, and as a participial adjective when referring to dented cars/cans or the kick-dented jukebox. Dent also expresses more figurative kinds of negative impacts, as in dented market confidence, or a dent in their image. \n Dint has a life of its own in the complex preposition by dint of, as in by dint of hard work / persistent lobbying / boundless imagination. This harks back to its once more general sense of “by force of,” though often now diluted to “by means of ” or “because of,” as in by dint of experience. \n In the US dint is also the conventional way of writing a one-syllabled pronunciation of “didn’t” – when rendering dialectal speech."

Both British and American databases contain a few citations for diptheria, all from printed sources which have undergone some sort of editorial scrutiny."

		"title": "direct or directly",
		"explanation":"Both these words may be used as adverbs, and in American and Australian English they may be used with any of the meanings attached to the adjective direct, in the dimensions of time and space. But British authorities since Fowler have insisted that direct as an adverb means “by the quickest route,” and cannot / should not (like directly) be used to mean “straight away.” The two kinds of meaning are not always separable in either word, as in the familiar instruction to Monopoly players: \n Go directly to Jail. Do not pass Go . . . \n Figurative uses of direct also mean “without deviation or delay,” in BNC citations such as: coming into drama training direct from school. The immediacy of the time frame is surely at least as salient as the notional space and direction in such idioms. The point is that directly can be purely temporal: \n With public funding it directly becomes a public project. \n whereas direct always blends time and space. \n Apart from its role as an adverb, directly also works occasionally as a temporal conjunction: \n They came directly they heard the news. This last usage is recognized in all the major dictionaries, British, American and Australian. The original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) dubbed it “colloquial,” as did Fowler (1926), though he also thought it “defensible.” New Oxford (1998) registers the use without restrictive label. Webster’s Third (1986) labeled it “chiefly British,” but Merriam- Webster (2000) notes it without any regional restriction."

		"title": "direct speech",
		"explanation":" The most dramatic way of reporting what someone said is direct speech, i.e. using not only their words, but their way of projecting them to the listener. Direct speech shows that the speech is being quoted verbatim. The use of first and second person pronouns (we and you) shows the direct address of the speaker to his listeners, and re-creates the drama of his words for the reader. In indirect speech the pronouns are commuted into the third person, with the noun and the pronoun. The change of modal from will (with its high degree of possibility) to the more remote would, is another adjustment from direct to indirect speech. Both kinds of change serve to soften the impact of the statement and push it back into the past. (See further under modality and person.) \n Between direct and indirect speech there are a number of other ways of quoting or reporting people’s words. These intermediate and oblique forms of reporting offer writers several ways of projecting the substance of actual speech, ways of modifying it and subtly controlling the reader’s response."

		"title": "dis-",
		"explanation":"This prefix, borrowed ultimately from Latin, often implies reversing the action of a verb. See for example: \n disagree disarm disclaim disconnect \n discount discourage disengage disentangle \n disinherit dislike dismount disobey \n disown distrust \n As these words show, it is usually combined with words of French or Latin origin, and with few Old English roots. \n When used with nouns and adjectives, it usually implies oppositeness and works as a straight negative: \n disadvantaged disapproval dishonest dishonor \n disorder dispassionate displeasure disreputable \n dissimilar distaste disunity \n Dis- replaced des-, the earlier French form of the prefix, almost entirely in common loanwords of the Middle English period. So for Chaucer discharge was descharge, and disturb was once destourbe. The only modern word to have resisted this respelling is descant. The respelling of dispatch as despatch is a different process (see under dispatch or despatch). \n Dis- overlaps with some other negative prefixes in English, notably (1) mis- and (2) un-. For the difference between: \n 1 distrust and mistrust see distrust, and for disinformation and misinformation, see mis-; \n 2 disinterested and uninterested, and dissatisfied and unsatisfied, see under the first of each pair. \n Note that dis- and dys- are separate prefixes, although disfunctional is sometimes seen for dysfunctional.

		"title": "disabled and disability",
		"explanation":"Used in reference to people, these words are now under scrutiny. Signs such as DISABLED PARKING have made it the standard way of identifying and providing for individuals with a particular disability. But in phrases such as the disabled it projects negativity, and may seem to suggest total incapacity on the part of disabled people. The simple reversal of that phrase in people with a disability is greatly preferred, because it foregrounds people rather than the problem. The alternative differently abled is recommended by some, because of its more positive implications and the fact that it does not draw attention to the impaired bodily function, as do blind, deaf, retarded, spastic etc. (See further under differently abled.) \n The lack of specificity in both disabled and differently abled can be a liability, for those who need to accommodate or provide for people with disabilities. Unless it’s clear what the disability is, there could be problems on both sides. Thus television programs designed to help the deaf need to advertise the fact that they provide for the hearing impaired by means of signing. For those unable to walk, the way into public buildings has to be signaled somehow (by means of Wheelchair access). This puts the spotlight on the real issue of getting wheels up steps, and takes it off the person who is incapacitated, whether temporarily or permanently. \n Not all groups with disabilities are inclined to seek more oblique references to their difficulties. The Deaf Pride group affirm the use of Deaf – and prefer it to be capitalized in any reference to their community, like the names of other national or linguistic groups (see capital letters section 1a). The affirmative use of sign languages such as ASL (American Sign Language), BSL (British Sign Language), and Auslan, their Australian counterpart, helps to accustom the hearing public to these alternative modes of communicating. Their status as community language again justifies the use of capitals. \n The concern to avoid negative stereotyping of the disabled does not mean that we must expunge words like blind, deaf, crippled, handicapped from the language. They have idiomatic and metaphorical uses which do not necessarily prejudice the interests of those with that particular disability, as when something falls on deaf ears, or a plan is crippled by the withdrawal of funds. Arguably such idioms underscore the very problem faced by those with that disability, making it impinge on the wider community. Still such usage needs to be carefully scrutinized in its context and for its implications, as part of the sensitization process. For the fully abled, there’s the salutary thought that we all ultimately find ourselves disabled, one way or another. \n ♦ For the basic issues of language engineering, see under political correctness and Whorfian principle."

		"title": "disc or disk",
		"explanation":"Both spellings are well used in the UK and the US – despite the notion that disc is British and disk American. The interplay between them is a continuing saga with new applications affecting their relative frequencies. While disk was the normal spelling from C17 on, the Oxford Dictionary (1989) records increasing use of disc in Britain from late C19 on, to make it “the usual spelling” as far as the Supplement (1972) was concerned. But by the 1990s disk is again in the ascendant in British English. So frequent are references to the computer disk, disk drive, hard disk, disk space etc. that disk is quite a lot more common than disc in data from the BNC. Disc nevertheless maintains a wider range of uses for disc-shaped objects of other kinds: the licence disc / identity disc, disc brakes, and especially the compact disc and disc jockey. \n In American English the picture is also divided, but with disc appearing much more often than one might expect in CCAE. This is primarily because of its use in compact disc or just disc, as in two-disc set and disc jockey again. The convergence of the music and computing industries in the common digital medium means that CD-ROM is quite often explained as compact disc (read-only memory) as well as compact disk – hardly surprising when the CD and the CD-ROM diskette look alike. The video disc/disk is another term in which both spellings appear. Yet computer hardware terms are normally spelled disk, in hard disk, disk drive etc. In other industries such as automobiles, manufacturers and reviewers use both disc brakes and disk brakes, and sportsmen suffer herniated discs and/or disks. Astronomers speaking of planetary bodies may use either disc or disk, but the astronauts journeying into space have prophylactic dime-shaped discs applied behind the ear to prevent motion sickness. So although Webster’s Third (1986) gives disk as the primary spelling for most contexts and most compound terms (except in the phonograph record industry), American usage seems to be more fluid and variable, caught between the metaphorical “rock” of discography and the hard drive, so to speak. \n Either spelling could be justified by etymology. The word is a descendant of the Latin discus and Greek diskos, so it all depends on how far back you wish to go."

Still about 1 in 10 American and British writers use discernable (by data in CCAE and the BNC), either in deference to the older tradition, or by using the regular English wordforming principle for English verbs.

		"title": "discourse markers",
		"explanation":" In any longish stretch of discourse, whether spoken or written, the reader/receiver welcomes some passing indications as to its structure. Writers and speakers sometimes go so far as to enumerate every structural unit of their discourse: first(ly), second(ly), third(ly); or they may simply mark the boundary between one unit and the next with the help of words such as another (point), a further (reason) etc. Such words mark both the beginning of the new unit and the end of the previous one. Contrastive conjunctions and conjuncts such as but, yet and however may also serve this function when used at the beginning of a sentence. (See further under conjunctions.) Like the Monty Python series, they imply “And now for something (completely) different.” \n More extended types of discourse markers are the ones which provide a carrier phrase for identifying the new unit or topic of discussion, such as: \n apropos of \n as far as . . . goes \n where . . . is concerned \n See further under dangling participles, and also topic."

		"title": "discreet or discrete",
		"explanation":"These words both go back to the Latin discretus meaning “set apart.” This meaning survives much more clearly in the academic word discrete (meaning “separate, distinct, unrelated”) than the common word discreet (“circumspect” or “careful in one’s actions and words”). In spite of these considerable differences in meaning, the two spellings were not regularly used to distinguish them until C16. \n The nouns discreteness and discreetness correspond to the two adjectives in their contemporary meanings.

		"title": "discrimination, discriminatory and discriminating",
		"explanation":"Discrimination has two faces, one negative, two positive, which are picked up in the different adjectives related to it. Discrimination against a particular social group is a negative phenomenon, implying prejudice as in racial discrimination, sexual discrimination, discrimination against Catholics, discrimination in the workplace. These negative values are embodied in discriminatory and neutralized in nondiscriminatory, a word applied to practices which are designed to avoid prejudicing or disadvantaging any social group. Many institutions, including governments and publishers, have formal codes of nondiscriminatory language. (See further under inclusive language.) The phrase positive discrimination is sometimes used in reference to institutional attempts to discriminate in favor of disadvantaged groups. \n Other, less political uses of discrimination are also positive, though never explicitly called that. These are its psychological and aesthetic uses in referring to the ability to distinguish, and the exercise of good taste and judgement, especially in arts, music, literature and similar cultural domains. The adjective discriminating works in exactly this way, as in the discriminating palate or a discriminating section of the concert audience. Lack of taste and judgement are imputed to the undiscriminating, although the scope for discrimination is still affirmed. Indiscriminate implies the total absence of any principles of selection, and is used of wanton behavior and unmotivated actions, as in indiscriminate shooting."

Disfranchise is the older of the two, dating from C15, while disenfranchise made its first appearance in C17. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986) give the wider range of meanings to disfranchise, but at the turn of the millennium disenfranchise is commoner by far, in both British and American English, judging by data from BNC and CCAE. It embodies expanding notions of disempowerment, in socially and culturally disenfranchised men and women. New frontiers are its use for a 19-year-old American woman disenfranchised last year by the hike in the (drinking) age limit, and the notion of disenfranchised nerds like Bill Gates (who felt excluded from the American male machismo). These examples show that disenfranchise covers both having lost a right/privilege, and never having had it at all.

		"explanation":"The primary and most frequent meaning of disinterest is “lack of interest,” and in BNC data this is its use about 90% of the time. This helps to explain the uphill battle with disinterested, which C20 usage commentators have tried to insist does not mean / cannot be used to mean “bored.” They are driven by a desire to neatly distinguish disinterested from uninterested as follows: \n ∗ disinterested = “unbiased,” “having no vested interest,” as in being asked to step in as the disinterested negotiator  \n ∗ uninterested = “indifferent,” “feeling or showing no mental involvement,” “bored,” as in begging an unknown, possibly uninterested deity for help \n Yet the use of disinterested to mean “indifferent,” “bored” goes back to C17, and though the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) declared it obsolete, the files were kept open. The second edition of the Oxford (1989) updates the record with fresh citations; and databases confirm its currency in both the UK and the US. Disinterested means “uninterested,” “bored” in more than 25% of all instances of the word in the BNC, and over 40% in American data from CCAE. Both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) register the sense, with usage notes to account for it. A further development, noted in Merriam-Webster but not New Oxford, is that disinterested can mean “having lost interest”: \n After that we became disinterested in each other. This makes perfect sense if you construe the word as a combination of privative dis- and interested. (See further under dis-.) \n Given that disinterested carries several meanings, we effectively rely on the context to show which is intended – as is true of many words. But with all the controversy, it may be better to seek a synonym for it, if you aim to communicate clearly and directly. Possible alternatives have been indicated in the discussion above."

In British English the two spellings are about equally popular, judging by their frequencies in BNC. But data from CCAE shows Americans strongly preferring dispatch. \n Of the two, dispatch has the better pedigree. Despatch seems in fact to have been a typographic mistake from the headword entered in Dr. Johnson’s dictionary. (Johnson elsewhere in the dictionary used dispatch.) The mistake survived until corrected in an 1820 reprint of the dictionary, but by then it had established itself in usage. The fluctuation of other words between dis- and des- (see dis-) certainly helped to make it a plausible variant.

		"title": "dispensable, indispensable and indispensible",
		"explanation":"The standard spellings with -able reflect their forebears in medieval Latin: dispensabilis and indispensabilis, and for many dictionaries they are the only spelling. Unabridged dictionaries list the variants dispensible and indispensible as well, and though the Oxford Dictionary (1989) labels them obsolete, there are isolated examples in data from the BNC, despite the prevalence of dispensable and indispensable overall. The same is broadly true of American English. Dispensable/indispensable dominate the data in CCAE, yet there are rather more instances of indispensible, occurring in about 1 in 20 cases of the word. Webster’s Third (1986) allows indispensible as an alternative spelling – but not dispensible, which is marked as obsolete.

		"title": "disposal or disposition",
		"explanation":"Both these relate to the verb dispose, but disposition preserves the older and more formal of its meanings, in expressing the ideas of “arrangement,” “control” and “temper or character.” When it comes to disposing of something however, disposal has taken over, except in legal contexts. So in dealing with a deceased estate, the will may refer to the disposition of property, but in other contexts it is normally disposal, as in waste disposal. The idiom at your disposal (“available for you to use as you see fit”) also has disposal occupying a slot which was once filled by disposition."

Borrowed from French, the word is not really analyzable in modern English, and has been largely eclipsed by the more transparent dissimulate (see next entry). Disassemble is a straightforward combination of the prefix dis- and assemble, the action of taking apart something which was joined together."

It describes the process by which one or other of two identical sounds in a word changes to something different.

This accords more with actual usage in the UK than in the US, by the evidence of BNC and CCAE. The British database has dissociate outnumbering disassociate by more than 3:1, whereas it’s the less common of the two in American data, occurring in the ratio 7:9.

(It also underlies the still in which distilling commonly takes place.) Distil was the headword spelling used by Dr. Johnson, though he was distinctly erratic on such words (see single for double). It nevertheless set the style used by the great majority of writers in the BNC, whereas almost all citations in CCAE have distill.

It implies being mentally preoccupied and detached from whatever is going on: the person oddly distrait hardly communicates with others around. Distracted is a C16 English calque of the Latin distractus, used of people whose attention is temporarily diverted, or who suffer from too many demands on their attention.

In both American and British data distrust is preferred for the verb, appearing twice as often as mistrust in that role.

		"explanation":"Outside North America, the past tense of dive is always dived, which goes back to the verb’s origins in Old English. Within North America dived and dove share the role, and both are acceptable, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989) and Canadian English (1997). Dove seems to have originated in Canada and the northern US during C19. Database evidence from CCAE shows that it has spread down the east and west coasts of the US, and serves as an alternative to dived in the Washington Post and Atlanta Journal, as well as the Los Angeles Times. In data from New York dove is less evident, probably because the New York Times (under Theodore Bernstein) campaigned against it. Elsewhere, dove and dived share the past tense for most uses of the word, whether it’s a matter of plunging into water, lunging for the ball, or ducking for cover. Dove also takes on the figurative senses, as in: \n He dove (dived) into cable TV in the 1960s. \n Kim dove (dived) deep into the cookies. \n But dived is still the only past participle, whatever the sense: he had dived into the river / cable TV. Note that compound verbs based on dive, such as nose-dive, belly-dive, crash-dive and scuba-dive, sky-dive, have dived for the past tense and past participle. \n International English selection: Since dived is current within North America and standard elsewhere in the English-speaking world, it’s the past tense to use for global communication."

		"title": "do",
		"explanation":"Like other auxiliary verbs, do has several functions. It regularly helps to phrase both negative and interrogative statements, and is occasionally used to express emphasis: \n I don’t like fresh air. \n Do you like fresh air? \n They do like fresh air. \n These uses are common to both British and American English, yet Americans make rather more use of do-support in certain constructions with have, where the British find alternative constructions. Compare: \n Do you have the time? (American) \n Have you the time? (British) \n The Longman Grammar (1999) found that do constructions with the definite article were used three times as often in American conversation and fiction as in British, whereas the British preferred constructions with have and have got. There was a similar trend (though less marked) with have to in negative constructions, where Americans were more likely to say don’t have to and the British haven’t got to. \n In both American and British English, do substitutes for other verbs in connected discourse, in parallel constructions and conversational exchanges: \n They asked for a map and I did too. \n You wanted to go? I didn’t. \n British speakers often use do as well as other auxiliaries to substitute for another verb, as in I haven’t seen him yet, but I will do tomorrow. Americans would omit the do and reduce it to . . . but I will tomorrow (Tottie, 2002). \n Aside from those auxiliary roles, do functions as a main verb in its own right. Broadly speaking it means “work on (something),” as in doing the dishes and doing the books, but it takes on different shades of meaning according to whatever it’s coupled with, and whatever context it occurs in. So doing Germany could mean completing an educational assignment on it, pursuing business connections in all quarters of the country, or touching down in Bonn and Berlin as part of a tourist package. \n ♦ For the plural of do when it serves as a noun, see hairdo and do."

The alternatives exist because the name embodies two variable features of English spelling, i varying with y, and ey with just y (see under i/y and -y/-ey). The word was the surname of a family of successful linen drapers, who, in late C17 England, “raised a fortune by finding out materials for such stuffs as might at once be cheap and genteel,” according to the Spectator magazine.

		"explanation":"This rare word for “grief ” has proved much less popular in English than in French, where it has multiple everyday meanings.

Being largely confined to the written form, its pronunciation has been unstable, varying from “dollar” to “dohlar” to “duller.” These coincidences with commoner English words may well have inhibited its use (see further under homonyms). Restoration and Victorian poets made dolour the familiar spelling, but it presents the usual -or/-our option, should you have to write it into C21 documents."

		"title": "-dom",
		"explanation":"This Old English suffix still makes abstract nouns out of more specific ones, although those of C20 have a certain ad hoc quality, and few of them have wide currency. In the US words with -dom have been created in media coverage to describe the people involved in particular industries e.g., sports or entertainments: \n moviedom newspaperdom oildom theaterdom turfdom \n Only stardom (actually dating from 1865) seems to be in common use. The American penchant for such words is believed to have been strengthened by the use of rebeldom in the American Civil War. \n Apart from these mostly temporary formations, English makes use of the suffix in a few words which describe particular states and conditions, such as boredom, freedom, martyrdom, serfdom. It also serves to form words which refer to an extent of territory, including Christendom, earldom, kingdom, princedom – or officialdom, where officials reign supreme. \n The word fiefdom for “a person’s domain of influence” is an early C19 coinage, based on fief – which in modern English means the same thing. Those familiar with fief regard fiefdom as a tautology, but for the rest fiefdom is more transparent.

		"title": "double genitive",
		"explanation":"Despite their apparent redundancy, double genitive constructions such as a friend of ours or no fault of Jo’s are established English idiom. Grammarians since C18 have puzzled over the way the construction iterates the of genitive with a genitive inflection on the following pronoun or personal noun. But the construction is confined to human referents: compare a friend of the Gallery / no fault of the Gallery. The double genitive seems to serve two purposes: \n ∗ emphasis. This is the effect of paraphrasing “not Jo’s fault” as no fault of Jo’s, or turning “our friend” into a friend of ours. The double genitive unpacks the phrase and foregrounds the noun rather than the person. In conversational examples such as That book of Bill Bryson’s is his best yet, the construction helps to adjust the topical focus (see topic section 4). \n ∗ clarification. Clearly a painting of Lady Rich’s and a painting of Lady Rich mean different things. The first (a possessive) makes the painting part of Lady Rich’s collection, while the second (technically an objective genitive) says that it is a portrait of the Lady herself. (See further under genitive.) The duplication of the genitive marker is thus not redundant but clarifies the fact that the first construction is a possessive genitive. \n The double genitive construction is not simply a double possessive, as it’s sometimes called. Rather it is a functional part of English grammar, and has been part of English idiom since C14."

		"title": "double modal",
		"explanation":"Constructions involving a sequence of two modal verbs do not normally appear in writing, though they are heard in some US dialects, in the Caribbean, and in the UK. Their use in Scots and Irish is reliably attested (Fennell and Butters, 1996), but most widespread in the US, in Midland and Southern (including southeastern) speech communities, black and white. The most commonly reported combination is might could, but others sometimes noted are might can, might should, might would, and the obsolescent should ought and had ought to. \n The juxtaposition of the two modals in might could and should ought seems to underscore the points at which they coincide on the scales of modality, for possibility and obligation respectively. (See further under modality.) Modal verbs vary considerably in meaning from context to context, hence perhaps the felt need for a kind of triangulation to underscore either their tentativeness or the intended imperative. \n Whatever the semantics of the double modal, it’s associated with spoken rather than written English, except where writers seek to capture the sound of dialect in dialogue or personalized narrative. See further under dialect."

		"title": "double negatives",
		"explanation":"All the following sentences contain double negatives, but is every one of them a no-no? \n 1 He didn’t say nothing. \n 2 He didn’t speak, I don’t think. \n 3 He wasn’t incapable of speaking \n Only one of them (the first) is the target of common criticism. The second would pass unnoticed as natural, considered speech; and the third is an accepted way of expressing a subtle observation. The third type of double negative often escapes attention because the second negative element is incorporated as a prefix into another word. \n Double negatives like those of the first sentence are very conspicuous, and they incur more censure than the others through their social connotations – the fact that they’re used in many nonstandard dialects. Sociolinguists find unconvincing the claim that double negatives are illogical “because two negatives make a positive.” The appeal to mathematics and logic is irrelevant when languages clearly do use double negatives (they are standard in languages such as French). No-one hearing the song line “I can’t get no satisfaction” would doubt that it was meant to be an emphatic negative, with the second negative word reinforcing the first. This was exactly how Shakespeare used the double negative to underscore a dramatic point: No woman has: nor never none / shall be mistress of it (Twelfth Night). Rather the introduction of one negative word triggers the use of others, wherever the grammar will bear it. Thus contemporary grammarians speak of “negative concord” or “multiple negation,” terms which allow for more than two negatives in quick succession. (See further under negative concord.) Still the construction is strongly associated with speech, and writers can find other ways of accentuating the negative. \n The double negatives of the second and third sentences above have an effect which is far from emphatic. Those in the second sentence make it quite tentative, and give the speaker subtle control over the force of the statement. Subtlety is achieved in the third sentence through the use of a negative word plus a negative prefix (any from the group in-, un-, non-, dis-, mis-). The double negative again helps to avoid a bald assertion, and paves the way for a new perspective on the topic. Combinations of this kind are quite often used in argumentative writing, as are those which combine a negative with a verb involving a negative process, such as challenge, deny, disclaim, dispute, doubt, miss, neglect, prevent, refuse, refute. Other auxiliary negative elements are the adverbs hardly and scarcely, and the particles unless and without. \n  Writers who use two or more of the negative elements just mentioned are unlikely to be charged with producing substandard English. They may well create difficult English however, and sentences which require mental gymnastics of the reader: \n He would never dispute the claim that there were no persons in the country unable to survive without a government pension. \n It is one of the precepts of the Plain English movement that such multiple negatives are to be avoided, and the reasons are obvious.

In C16 there was no constraint on their use, and Shakespeare uses them in several of his plays to underscore a dramatic judgement. The use of most highest in religious discourse is similarly rhetorical, and was exempted by some C18 grammarians (notably Lowth, Bishop of London) from the general censure of double superlatives. Grammarians can certainly argue that one or other superlative marker is redundant, and in measured prose one of them would be edited out. Just which depends on the adjective’s form.

		"title": "doubling of final consonant",
		"explanation":"To double or not to double, that is the question. It comes up with new verbs made out of nouns and adjectives: what to do with the past forms of verbs derived from banquet and sequin, for example. It is also the basis of regular differences between British and American spelling. Let’s review the general rules before looking at the variations. \n In a two-part nutshell, the general rule is that you double the final consonant if: \n ∗ the vowel before the consonant is a single one (as in wetted or regretted ), not a digraph (compare seated and repeated ); and \n ∗ the syllable before the suffix is stressed (as in wetted and regretted), not unstressed (compare budgeted and marketed ). \n The rule applies to any noun, verb or adjective ending in a single consonant, when suffixes beginning with a vowel or -y are to be added. The following examples show how the rule works with various suffixes and after words of one and two syllables: \n skims skimming \n bosom bosomy \n win winner \n step stepped \n  begin beginner \n sequin sequined \n gallop galloped \n stir stirred \n  deter deterred \n  butter buttered \n knit knitting \n admit admitting \n audit auditing \n (Further examples are discussed under -p/-pp-, -s/-ssand -t.) Note that some words, especially those ending in -r, vary their spelling because of changes in stress before particular suffixes: \n confer conferred conference \n defer deferred deferent \n prefer preferred preferable \n refer referred reference \n These changes are all in accordance with the rule above. They apply also to derivatives of these words, such as undeterred, dispreferred etc. \n Exceptions, variations and anomalies Certain kinds of words diverge from the rules just mentioned, in all or some parts of the English-speaking world. They include those ending in: \n 1 -x such as tax and transfix (never doubled, even when their last syllable is stressed). \n 2 -c such as panic (always “doubled” to -ck, to preserve their “k” sound: see further under -c/-ck-). \n 3 a syllable which is identical with a monosyllabic word. For example: \n  backlog eavesdrop fellowship format \n handicap kidnap leapfrog overlap \n program sandbag waterlog worship \n zigzag \n In British English, these words double the final consonant in spite of the lack of stress, to become backlogged, handicapped, programmed etc. In American English they may not: alternative spellings such as kidnaped, programed and worshiped are also in use. See kidnapped, program and worshipped. Words ending in -l form the largest group of exceptions in British English, and are always doubled, whether or not the last syllable is stressed. In the US the common practice is to apply the general rules given above, and to double only when there is stress on the final syllable. So most Americans write reveled with one l and rebelled with two, whereas the British, and most Australians and Canadians, spell revelled in the same way as rebelled. These anomalies are discussed further under -l-/-ll-."

First choice is draconian/Draconian which invokes Draco, the punitive Greek legislator of C7 BC, who made death the punishment for almost every public offence. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) still has it capitalized, though the lower case form prevails in British and American English. In data from the BNC, draconian dominates by more than 4:1, and the proportions are similar in CCAE, except where (in some American newspapers) Draconian seems to be cultivated as house style. The word serves to evaluate legislation and official policies on either side of the Atlantic: \n draconian wage measures \n the draconian 42-year sentence had been negated \n draconian cuts on Medicare \n draconian rules governing drug trafficking \n The adjective draconic is quite rare by comparison. It is a neoclassical adjective based on the Latin draco (“dragon”), used by scholars and scientists to refer to dragon-like forms in art and nature. But as the Oxford Dictionary shows, it has long been confused with the first adjective, and sometimes replaces it. The few occurrences of draconic in the BNC and CCAE were almost all of this kind, as in draconic vagrancy laws from CCAE. Most dictionaries allow that draconic may do service for draconian."

		"title": "draft or draught",
		"explanation":"The borders between these two spellings are still being adjusted in British English. Both relate to the verb draw, whose many descendants range from words for pulling a load, or drawing water, air or money, to sketching, composing a document, dividing up one’s livestock or choosing men for military service. The older spelling draught has few analogies in English except laughter, and the more phonetic draft gained ground on it in late C18 and early C19. In American English draft is the standard spelling for all uses of the word as noun, adjective and verb (first draft, draft legislation, draft a new constitution), and in derivatives such as drafty and draftsman. In Britain, the scene is much more complicated. \n In British English draft is now accepted in the contexts of banking, in selecting soldiers and livestock, and especially when referring to the first written version of a document. This last usage accounts for more than 80% of its occurrences in the BNC, as noun, adjective and verb, and they make draft overall much more frequent than draught. Yet still the business of making technical drawings is distinguished with the spelling draught, and in draughtsman/draughtsperson. Draught persists in references to the taking of fluids, as in a good draught of ale and of course draught beer. It identifies an icy draught under the door, and presents itself also in the adjective draughty. The animals used for traction are draught horses, and vehicles too may be used for draught work. In maritime jargon, draught is the measure of how deep the vessel lies in the water (the distance from the waterline to the hull). \n English-speakers in other parts of the world take their positions on the borders of this British/American divide. Canadians accept both practices but make more use of the American, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). Australians still endorse draught beer and draught horse, but are uncommitted when it comes to the flow of cool air under the door. They regularly use draft for technical drawing as well as for composing documents, and this spelling is confirmed in the official nomenclature draftsperson or drafting officer/assistant, recommended in the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (1990). In the context of marine architecture, a survey taken in 1998 showed that the majority of professionals used draft rather than draught in relation to the ship’s draught. \n Thus boundaries between draft and draught are still being redrawn – even in British English. The BNC contains 10 examples of drafty, suggesting that the spelling comes naturally to some writers, and may not be edited out. Draughty appears almost 100 times, however, and is still the one, according to British dictionaries."

		"title": "drier or dryer, and driest or dryest",
		"explanation":"You can usually count on the fact that drier represents the comparative form of the adjective dry, while dryer is the agent noun referring to an appliance, such as a clothes dryer. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986) nevertheless make drier the preferred spelling for the noun, and it’s used by a few British writers represented in the BNC (about 10%), hardly at all by American writers in CCAE. The rare instance of hair drier is greatly outnumbered by uses of dryer in both domestic and industrial contexts. Newer or less familiar appliances such as the lettuce dryer or the doggie dryer used in canine haute couture are invariably spelled with y. \n Drier is writers’ choice for the comparative adjective in both databases, whether the word refers to climatic conditions, the taste of wine or food, or the analysis of politics, literature and humor, as in chapters on drier subjects and the drier Midwestern drollery. Whether positive or negatively valued, drier is the spelling used.Webster’s also allows for dryer, the regularized spelling, though CCAE contains very few examples of its use. \n When it comes to the superlative, American and British usage diverge. Dryest is more popular than driest with American writers in CCAE, whereas driest is the only superlative form to be found in the BNC. The adjective thus seems to be the stronghold of the spelling convention by which final y changes to i before the vowel of the suffix (see further under -y>-i-). In C18 this mutation was also found in driness and drily, though it is no longer seen in the first of those, and is disappearing from the second (see drily or dryly). The resistance of the nouns (dryness, dryer) to mutation suggests that the “-y becomes -irule” is increasingly restricted to inflectional suffixes (see suffixes). At any rate, the prevailing use of dryer for the agent noun (“appliance”) makes a useful contrast with drier for the adjective – and lends hope that dealing with some dryer company doesn’t mean an uphill social encounter."

		"title": "drink, drank, drunk and drunken",
		"explanation":"The parts of this irregular verb have been unstable for centuries, and still seem to be shifting and changing places. The forms drink, drank, drunk are always given as the standard set for present, past tense and past participle, yet larger dictionaries show that things are not so simple. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes without judgement the “occasional” use of drunk for the past tense, while Webster’s Third (1986) presents it as a colloquial or dialectal form. Both BNC and CCAE contain a sprinkling of it among their spoken samples. The dictionaries also note that drank may occasionally be found as past participle. Oxford suggests that this is to “avoid the inebriate associations of drunk,” though there’s little evidence of its use – for this or any other reason – even in spoken samples of the BNC. Webster’s also presents without judgement the use of drank for the past participle, and, according to a usage note in the Random House Dictionary, this is often done by educated Americans. Still there’s little evidence that the variant form appears in written documents, as Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes. \n The form drunken (once a past participle) has only a restricted role as attributive adjective: drunken rage, a drunken sailor. It thus complements drunk, the predicative adjective in expressions such as They were drunk and disorderly. See further under adjectives."

		"title": "due to or owing to",
		"explanation":"Due to has been under a cloud for three centuries, though the basis of objections to it has shifted. Fowler (1926) found the problem in the need to make due an adjective or participle properly attached to a relevant noun, not to a notion extracted from a whole clause/sentence. The first sentence below was therefore unacceptable, and should be rewritten as the second or third. \n Due to unforeseen circumstances the dinner was postponed. \n The postponement of the dinner was due to unforeseen circumstances. \n Owing to unforeseen circumstances, the dinner was postponed. Similar objections had in fact been raised against owing to in C18, which quietly faded away as it established itself as a compound preposition. Due to began to be used in the same way in late C19 (the first Oxford Dictionary citation is from 1897), and objections to it begin to appear early in C20. \n Yet Fowler himself noted that this prepositional use of due to was “as common as can be”, and the Oxford Dictionary Supplement (1933) confirmed its frequency in the US. The tide of usage has swept it in, as Gowers admits in his 1965 edition of Fowler, when BBC announcers and even the Queen’s own speech-writer have to be counted among its more conspicuous users. There is clearly no reason to perpetuate the shibboleth against due to, when the grammatical grounds for objecting to it are so dubious.

The use of dwarfs as a verb (as in this source of income dwarfs social security) makes up only about 20% of the total, so clearly it’s preferred for the plural noun. Dwarfs is also sounder in historical terms because the f in its spelling is relatively recent, unlike others whose -ves plural goes back to Old English. Dwarves seems to have arisen on the analogy of wharf/wharves, where the plural with -ves connects with its antecedents. The number of words with -ves plurals is steadily declining, and there’s no reason to count dwarf among them, on the strength of very sporadic uses of dwarves.

The rare third spelling duad also seems to be obsolete by the Oxford’s dating, yet is glossed with no indication of obsolescence in Webster’s. New uses for dyad in sociology and theories of communication seem to account for its vitality, as well as the variation in spelling. The tendency to replace y with i is familiar enough in other nouns, though dyad represents the original Greek root more exactly."

		"title": "dyarchy or diarchy",
		"explanation":"Both are recognized spellings, yet dictionaries diverge over which should be given priority. Webster’s Third (1986) stands alone in preferring dyarchy, and this is the only spelling to be found in CCAE. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) prefers diarchy, based strictly on its view of the etymology (as di- + -archy), and so it dubs dyarchy “erroneous”. Webster’s however suggests that the first element can be traced to Greek dy- or dyo- (otherwise transliterated as “duo,” but with the same meaning as di-). Whatever the explanation, dyarchy is the more frequent spelling in both BNC and CCAE, and the Oxford’s own citations run 5:3 in its favor. Perhaps users of the word feel it looks more consistently Greek as dyarchy. \n The same divergence in spelling applies to adjectives based on the noun. While Oxford gives priority to spellings with i in the stem: diarchic, diarchical and diarch(i)al, Webster’s gives them as dyarchic, also dyarchical or dyarchal. Again the Oxford’s citations offer rather more support for the spellings with y. For the choice between -ic and -ical endings, see -ic/-ical."

So Addison in C17 spelled both dye, while Johnson made both die. (See further under i/y, -ie>-y-, and -e.)

Apart from its use in designating medical problems, dys- also serves to designate intellectual deficiencies (dyslexia and dyscalculia). \n Dys- occasionally forms words which contrast with an opposite number formed with eu-, for example dysphemism as opposed to euphemism (see further under euphemisms). The recently coined dystopia works on that basis, as an antonym for Utopia – misconstrued as “Eutopia.” (The name Utopia created by Sir Thomas More for his perfect society actually comprises ou, “not”, and topos, “place,” i.e. “no place.”) \n ♦ On the interplay between dys- and dis-, see next entry."

The substitution of i for y in the spelling is not so remarkable (see i/y), and both dys- and dis- have negative meanings.

		"explanation":"In the countdown to the millennium, the letter e sprang to life as a prefix. Literally it means “electronic,” and more broadly that electronic communication is the key process involved, whether it is e-business, e-commerce, e-money, e-tailing (for “retailing”), or e-books, e-documents, e-mail, e-zines. \n Words formed with e- are usually written with hyphens (but see email). Without a hyphen the one-letter prefix is somewhat at risk, and indistinguishable from the e- which represents the Latin prefix ex-, in words such as education, elation, emergence (see ex-). And if education is to be conducted via the internet, it has to be e-education."
	},
	{
		"title": "-e",
		"explanation":"E is the most hardworked letter of the English alphabet, as every Scrabble player knows. Apart from representing its own sound (as in let, send ), it often serves as a silent modifier of others (as in mate, rage). Sometimes (as in some, true) it is a relic of times when far more English words ended in e – when “olde shoppe” was indeed common spelling. In the course of history, final e has come and gone from many words; and in C21 English it still varies in the spelling of words. Its presence or absence is dictated by a number of rules and conventions: \n  The major rule affecting -e is dropping it before a suffix beginning with a vowel or y. This applies to an enormous number of words in English. It happens regularly with the parts of a verb – hope, hoping, hoped – and with adjectives: simple, simpler, simplest. It also applies whenever words with final e are extended into new words: \n -able note>notable \n -age dose>dosage \n -al arrive>arrival \n -ation conserve>conservation \n -ator demonstrate>demonstrator \n  -er believe>believer \n -ery machine>machinery \n -ify false>falsify \n -ise pressure>pressurise \n -ish prude>prudish \n -ism elite>elitism \n -ist extreme>extremist \n -ity saline>salinity \n -ize pressure>pressurize \n -ous virtue>virtuous \n -ure expose>exposure \n -y craze>crazy \n The rule does not apply when the suffix begins with a consonant, for example: \n -ful hope>hopeful cf. hoping \n -ly close>closely closing \n -ment advertise>advertisement advertising \n -ness humble>humbleness humbling \n 2 Exceptions and variations to the major rule are as follows: \n a) Words suffixed with -able such as lik(e)able, siz(e)able (i.e. those with stems of one syllable) often retain the -e of the stem in British English. (See further under -eable.) \n b) Words ending -dge often lose the e before -ment, especially in American English. (See acknowledgement, judgement and also fledgling.) \n c) Words ending with -ce or -ge keep their final e before a suffix beginning with a, e.g. embraceable, and o, e.g. courageous. (See further under -ce/-ge.) \n d) Words ending with -ee such as agree and decree drop one e before -ed, but keep both before -ing. So agreed but agreeing. \n e) Words ending in -inge such as singe may keep the e before adding -ing, and thus singeing is distinct from singing, springeing from springing, swingeing from swinging, tingeing from tinging. Some writers keep the -e in other rather uncommon verbs of this kind, e.g. bingeing, hingeing, twingeing, whingeing, even though there are no parallel words without the -e to confuse them with. But no-one keeps the -e in the more familiar verbs with -inge (e.g. cringe, fringe, impinge, infringe), and those with other vowels (e.g. change, lunge, plunge, sponge), which always become cringing, changing etc., in accordance with the major rule. \n f ) Words ending in -ie, such as die, lie, tie, vie change in two ways before -ing: they drop their e and change the i to y (see -ie->-y-). However tieing is recognized in Webster’s Third (1986) as an alternative to tying; and for stymie there is both stymying and stymieing (see stymie). The use of dying makes a vital contrast with dyeing (see dye and dyeing). \n g) Words ending in -oe regularly keep their e before -ing: canoeing, hoeing, shoeing, toeing. Before -ist, it is the same for canoeist, but not for oboist. \n h) Words ending in -ue often keep their e before a suffix beginning with i or y, particularly if they have only one syllable. So clue and glue retain it in cluey and gluey (to ensure that they are not read as words of one syllable like buy). This explains why blue appears with e in bluey-green, but not usually in bluish. As a technical term blueing is more likely to keep its e than in common idiom: bluing all his pay at the races. Among standard verbs, the e is regularly dropped in inflected forms, as for: \n accrue argue construe continue \n ensue issue pursue queue \n rescue subdue value \n accrue argue construe continue \n ensue issue pursue queue \n rescue subdue value \n Verbs of one syllable, notably cue and sue, are less predictable. The much older verb sue has had suing as its -ing form since around 1300, and it’s the dominant form by far in hundreds of examples in the British and American databases. But cue with its much shorter history (only a little more than a century) has yet to settle into the regular pattern. Cueing is sanctioned by the Oxford Dictionary (1989) for technical (engineering) uses of the noun, and though nothing is said about the verb, it’s the only spelling in the BNC for all forms with -ing – whether they involve cueing the [autocues] to suit the speaker’s delivery, unconscious cueing by the human experimenter, or cueing individuals into major roles. In CCAE meanwhile, both cuing and cueing can be found,and the first is in the majority, even though the second is backed by Webster’s Third (1986) for all applications of the word. The fact that cue is a three-letter word would help to explain its variability: see (i) below. \n i) Three-letter words which end in e may or may not keep it before suffixes: in ageism the e is usually there, in icing never. Others such as ag(e)ing, ap(e)ing, aw(e)ing and ey(e)ing may appear either way. The Langscape survey of 1998 showed British respondents preferred to maintain the e before the suffix in all of them, whereas for Americans it was only in eyeing. Three-letter verbs thus become a new group of exceptions, at least for the British. They apply, to inflected forms, the English spelling principle associated with content words: that they need a minimum of three letters to identify themselves (see further under words). Identity problems are of course more likely when such words appear without context in questionnaires and dictionary lists. When the word is established and/or its meaning supported by the context, there’s less reason not to spell it according to the major rule. (Compare aging and usable.) \n 3 Other spelling conventions with final e are: \n *A final e is sometimes added to a gender-free English word ending in -ant or -ist to create an explicitly female form of it, for example: \n artiste clairvoyante confidante typiste \n This is analogous to what happens in French grammar, though in French it is more often used for reasons of grammatical gender than natural gender (see further under gender). The use of explicitly female words is often beside the point, and to be discouraged if we care about nonsexist language (see further under that heading). In cases like these, the gender-free equivalent is much better established anyway. \n *A final e is sometimes added to French loanwords used in English, even when they have none in French itself. So there are alternative spellings (with and without the e) for words such as boulevard(e), caviar(e), chaperon(e), complin(e). The spellings with e are really “more French than the French.” This is one of several ways in which French loanwords are sometimes touched up in English. (For others, see under frenchification.) \n *A final e often distinguishes proper names from their common noun counterparts, in addition to the initial capital letter. Some examples are Coote, Hawke, Lowe, Moore. Not all bearers of such names use these spellings however, and letter writers should always check whether they’re corresponding with Brown or Browne, Clark or Clarke etc. (See further under proper names.) \n *A final e is used by chemists to distinguish the names of certain groups of chemical substances – though this technical distinction is not necessarily understood by those who use the spelling glycerine rather than glycerin, for example. See further under -ine/-in."

		"title": "-eable or -able",
		"explanation":"The -eable ending is a composite of the final e of the base word and the -able suffix. English spelling requires -eable in some words, while it’s an option for others. Words such as changeable and traceable need -eable because it serves to preserve the “j” or “s” sound in them (see -ce/-ge). Other words such as the following could be spelled either way, depending on your variety of English: \n blam(e)able fram(e)able grad(e)able lik(e)able \n liv(e)able mov(e)able nam(e)able rat(e)able \n sal(e)able shak(e)able siz(e)able trad(e)able \n us(e)able \n The choice is broadly regional, but spellings vary more in the UK than the US, as reflected in (or led by) the major dictionaries. Webster’s Third (1986) gives the -able spelling priority over -eable for all; whereas the Oxford Dictionary (1989) prioritizes -eable for most examples such as likeable, liveable, sizeable (except that it goes the other way for usable). Other dictionaries seem to pick and choose. The Canadian Oxford (1998) gives preference to -eable in likeable and liveable, but not in sizable or usable. In Australia the Macquarie Dictionary (1997) prefers sizeable, but -able for the others. Regional differences were borne out by the 1998 Langscape survey, in which the majority of North Americans (including Canadians) backed the shorter likable, sizable, while British respondents and Australians preferred the longer likeable, sizeable. Yet older UK respondents were more inclined to use the shorter spellings, perhaps because Fowler (1926) spoke firmly in favor of -able. Data from the BNC suggests stronger British commitment to likeable (97%) than sizeable (85%). Quantitative research on New Zealand English (Sigley, 1999) showed that NZ use of -eable is on a par with the British. \n Spellings with plain -able are in line with the major rule over dropping final e (see -e section 1). When the stem has two or more syllables, as in debatable, unshakable, reconcilable, (un)mistakable, the rule usually prevails everywhere in the world. With stems of only one syllable, e.g. lik(e)able, some argue that the e is needed before -able to prevent misreading. This is an unnecessary extension of the idea that you need a minimum of three letters to represent a stem (see -e section 2i). Established and undisputed spellings such as curable and notable show that the e in the middle is inessential. Even new formations such as drivable are unlikely to be misread if motor vehicles are already part of the context. The words we read rarely have to stand alone for interpretation, as they do in dictionary lists. \n International English selection: The regular rule for words suffixed with -able has been used throughout this book, for the reasons just given. \n ♦ For more on mov(e)able and us(e)able, see movable and usable."

	{
		"title": "earthen, earthy or earthly",
		"explanation":"Only the first of these is still completely in touch with the ground. Earthen means “consisting or made out of earth or clay,” as in earthen floor. Earthy usually highlights the natural properties of earth which can be recognized elsewhere, as in an earthy smell, or its elemental characteristics in an earthy sense of humor. Depending on context, earthy may carry positive or negative overtones. In the appreciation of wines, it can be ambiguous (Lehrer, 1983), implying a down-to-earth, robust wine to some tasters, and a mouldy bouquet to others. \n Earthly takes its core meaning from being the antonym of heavenly. When used in expressions such as earthly pleasures, it usually implies their limited or short-term nature, in comparison with the infinity of heaven. But it doesn’t become a synonym for heavenly, when negative elements are attached to it. With the negative prefix un-, it denotes eerie elements of the supernatural, as in unearthly cry. And in negative idioms such as no earthly reason and not an earthly chance, earthly simply underscores the negative. See further under intensifiers."

		"title": "east, eastern or easterly",
		"explanation":"When used with lower case, these words all relate straightforwardly to a point, area or direction which is 90 degrees right of the north/south axis for a particular country or city. In the absence of any geographical reference points, it relates to the writer’s or speaker’s north/south axis. \n The main thing to note is that when applied to winds, airstreams or currents, these words denote “from the east,” whereas in other applications they mean “to(wards) or in the east.” So an easterly wind will have its impact on the eastern side of a building, and wildflowers in the eastern region of a national park will have walkers heading east to see them. \n When dressed with a capital letter, East often carries special historical or political overtones. In Middle East or Far East, it still represents the European colonial perspective. What was the Far East for Britain is the “Near North” for Australia, as its Prime Minister observed in 1939. (Compare the expression Southeast Asia, which is free of any “user-perspective.”) The difference between European cultures and those of colonial countries was the stimulus for Rudyard Kipling’s comment in C19 that “East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.” But the need for mutual understanding was better recognized in C20, in institutions such as the East–West Center, established at the University of Hawaii in 1960. \n After World War II and during the subsequent Cold War, eastern acquired a new political significance in the phrase eastern bloc, used in reference to the Soviet Union and its East European satellites. Its communist system and centralized economy contrasted with those of the capitalistic states of western Europe and North America, allied through NATO. But the old east–west division has faded since the breakup of the eastern bloc in 1991. \n The implications of Eastern are different again in references to the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the word identifies the group of churches which developed in the eastern half of the Roman Empire and were for centuries identified with Byzantium/Constantinople. They include the churches of Greece and Cyprus, Egypt and some cities in the Middle East, as well as Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Serbia. The group split off from the Catholic Church (based on Rome) in AD 1054."

		"explanation":"Words which end in -eau or -ieu (or -iau) are borrowings from French where they are pluralized with -x, e.g. bureau > bureaux. However once they are at home in English they acquire English plurals as well, e.g. bureaus. Those which are totally assimilated may indeed shed their French plural, and in American English bureaus is now the only plural form current, judging by the evidence of CCAE – for the commercial bureau that specializes in computer type-setting, design, printing etc. But in British usage the Citizens Advice Bureaux and similar agencies keep the -x plural to the fore, and bureaus makes little showing in the BNC. Many similar loanwords still have both French and English plurals, including: \n bandeau bateau beau chapeau \n chateau flambeau fricandeau gateau \n manteau morceau plateau portmanteau \n reseau rouleau tableau tonneau \n trousseau \n In the UK and Canada, the -x plural is more likely to be used than in the US or Australia, though it’s available anywhere to those seeking to emphasize or exploit the foreign connection. The Australian patisserie which advertises its “gateaux’s” is trying to make doubly sure! \n Likewise adieu may be pluralized with either -s or -x, but the English plural adieus is now more frequent and entirely justifiable. The word has been in English for centuries – since Chaucer – and writers of C16 and C17 tended to anglicize the spelling of its root as adew and adue. Purlieu, another early borrowing, has only the English plural purlieus. But milieu, borrowed in C19, still more commonly makes its plural as milieux, at least in British English. In BNC data, it outnumbered milieus by more than 3:1. American preferences illustrated in CCAE again ran the opposite way. \n With fabliau the plural fabliaux is universally preferred.

And with ecology, coined only in C19, we focus on the environment and systemic or symbiotic relationships within it. In compounds of C20 and C21, eco- takes its cue from ecology, hence its latter-day meaning “environment”: \n ecocide eco-defense eco-engineer \n  ecofreak eco-friendly eco-guerrillas \n ecohazard eco-label eco-leftist \n eco-literature eco-radical eco-sabotage \n ecospecies ecosphere ecosystem \n eco-terrorism eco-theology ecothriller \n Eco- has generated a plethora of new words which embody the environmental perspective in politics, economics, social action etc., and sometimes polarized attitudes to it. Many are ad hoc, not listed in dictionaries; and hyphens are a variable element. In examples such as ecosphere, eco- operates like a prefix or classical combining form, whereas in others (eco-label), it comes close to being a compound element. In American data from CCAE, the hyphen is regularly used, although a few eco- compounds also appear with space, e.g. eco group, eco tourism. Clearly eco- is close to being an independent word."

		"title": "economic or economical",
		"explanation":"As with many -ic/-ical pairs, there is common ground between these, as well as a demarcation difference, though the picture keeps changing. The “economical man” of C19 political philosophy is the “economic man” of C20. Thus economic has generally displaced economical in references to matters of economics and the structure of the economy at large; and economical now relates to economy measures (or economies) by which to avoid extravagance and wastage. So while treasurers and governments concern themselves with large-scale economic strategies, those responsible for the household finances work on economical uses of a small budget. Which is not to say that governments aren’t also expected to be economical. The two adjectives embody different perspectives on money, one theoretical, the other practical. \n Note however that these distinctions are sometimes blurred, at least in colloquial usage, as is acknowledged in dictionaries all over the world. In any case the two different perspectives are not always easy to separate, for example in expressions like an economic necessity. There is only one adverb for the two words, economically, and we rely on the context to show which sense is intended. Only in the verb economize/economise is the meaning unquestionably linked with implementing a practical economy measure. See further under -ic/-ical."

		"title": "ecstasy or ecstacy",
		"explanation":"The spelling ecstasy is standard for British and American English, in keeping with the word’s origin in Greek ekstasis, via Old French exstasie. But in English the word has few analogues ending in -asy, whereas -acy appears in a number of common abstract nouns such as delicacy, diplomacy, fallacy, privacy. This accounts for the variant spelling ecstacy, marked “obsolete” in the Oxford Dictionary (1989) with no citations since C18. The nonstandard spelling with -acy is however used by a dozen British writers included in the BNC, all in reference to the common stimulant and hallucinogenic drug, with and without capital letter. Ecstacy also appears in data from CCAE, used not only in reference to the drug but in other senses as well: ecstacy of joy; religious ecstacy; supposed ecstacy of a drug high. Its use is registered in Webster’s Third (1986), as a current alternative to ecstasy for any sense of the word. \n ♦ Compare idiosyncrasy."

		"title": "-ed",
		"explanation":"Many an English verb takes the -ed suffix for its past forms (both past tense and past participle), as for example: \n bounded claimed departed \n liked organized wandered \n Verbs like these are the regular verbs of English (see further under irregular verbs). In some cases the -ed makes a separate syllable (bounded, departed), in others it just adds an extra consonant, a “d” sound in claimed, and a “t” sound in liked. The past forms of some verbs are in fact always spelled with t, witness: \n bent built crept dealt \n felt kept left lent \n meant sent slept spent \n swept wept \n Among these, the t either takes the place of d in the stem of the word (as in bent<bend), or substitutes for the -ed suffix (as in dealt<deal).   The list was once longer. Spellings such as past and wrapt are relics of others. Even the “regular” past ending turns out to be not entirely regular. \n 1 Verbs with both -ed and -t. Several verbs have alternative past forms, including: \n  burned/burnt dreamed/dreamt \n  dwelled/dwelt kneeled/knelt \n leaned/leant leaped/leapt \n learned/learnt smelled/smelt \n spelled/spelt spilled/spilt \n  spoiled/spoilt \n The regular -ed forms are dominant in North American English for the past tense/participle of all these verbs except dwelt and knelt, whereas in British and Australian English both -ed and -t are used. The use of the -t form may have increased in Britain during C20, according to Gowers’s 1965 edition of Fowler’s Modern English Usage. Data from Australia (Peters, 1993b) also shows the persistence of the -t spellings for past tense/participle. (See further under burned, dreamed, dwelt, knelt, leaned, leaped, learned, smell, spelled, spill, spoil.) When the participle serves as adjective, the -t forms are regularly used, as in spilt milk and burnt offering (or toast), even in the US. But the opposite holds for learn, for which learned is the standard adjectival form, with one syllable in learned responses, and two in a learned man. The two-syllabled pronunciation (with -ed as a separate syllable) is a remnant of medieval English, surviving in few other participial adjectives, apart from aged, bless ´ ed, dogg ´ ed. ´ (Those derived from nouns are discussed in section 2 below.) \n Some writers attach different grammatical meanings to the -ed and -t forms: intransitive v. transitive; continuous v. perfect aspect; active v. passive (see under burned). But the grammar is vested in the sentence construction, and never depends on the spelling. Other writers – less grammatically inclined – sometimes correlate the use of -ed and -t with the way they pronounce the word, though this is idiosyncratic and cannot be accessed by the reader. Either way, the spelling doesn’t change the meaning of what is written. The variation is redundant and perhaps distracting when the regular -ed could be used consistently. \n 2 Noun-based adjectives with -ed. Not all adjectives ending in -ed are based on verbs (i.e. their past participles). Examples such as pointed, ragged, walled, wooded show them derived directly from nouns (point, rag, wall, wood ), rather than an intermediary verb. This is all the more obvious with compound adjectives in -ed such as fair-minded, giant-sized, thin-skinned, three-legged, which can only be derived from a noun phrase (“fair mind,” “three legs”). It also explains why the first component is adjectival rather than adverbial in form: compare thin-skinned with thinly spread. See also zero adverbs. \n 3 When -ed may be spelled d (i.e. apostrophe d). Though ’d often stood for -ed in C17 English, it now does so only when the verb ends in a vowel: a, e, i, o, ´ or u. Fowler (1926) recommended it for verbs that are derived directly from nouns (e.g. cupola’d, mascara’d ); and it has some value for those ending in more than one vowel (e.g. plateau’d, radio’d, shanghai’d), as well as those based on foreign adjectives (e.g. cliche’d, flamb ´ e’d´ ). This use of apostrophe d accords with the fact that: \n a) apostrophes have long been used to mark omission (see under apostrophes); and \n b) the -(e)d suffix never makes a separate syllable in such words. \n Apostrophe d was much more popular with British respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) than with those from other parts of the English-speaking world – who were more inclined to retain the regular -ed spellings. Another strategy sometimes used in such cases is to add a hyphen: mascara-ed, radio-ed. But it has the disadvantage of seeming to create an extra syllable and had little following, according to a survey reported in English Today (1988).  \n Few words of this kind are entered in dictionaries. When they are, the American dictionaries give them the regular spelling (as in hennaed, umbrellaed, visaed); whereas British dictionaries generally give the apostropheed (or rather apostrophe’d) spelling. Though apostrophe helps when there are two (or more) different vowels preceding the suffix, it seems unnecessary when the vowels are identical, as in baaed and tattooed. In any case verbs ending with double e (agree, filigree, pedigree, referee, tee) conform to the general rule of dropping their final e before -ed (see -e section 2d). So the regular -ed spelling works well enough in most cases, and offers a clear principle for new or ad hoc verbs. \n International English selection: Spellings with the regular -ed are used for verbs in this book wherever they are available, for the reasons discussed in sections 1 and 3 above. \n ♦ For the choice between aged 16 and age 16, see inflectional extras."

Some dictionaries apply education(al)ist to those interested in the theory and methods of teaching; and educator to those in direct contact with students, whether as lecturer, tutor, classroom teacher or coach. However Webster’s English Usage (1989) finds little evidence of educator for “teacher,” rather that it serves as a general term for the educational theorist and administrator; and that educationist tends to be used disparagingly in the US (but not the UK). Educator is the commonest of the three by far in data from CCAE, and both educationist and educationalist are rare. British data from the BNC presents roughly equal numbers of educationalist and educationist, despite Fowler’s (1926) preference for the latter. But educator is rather more common than either, and again seems to subsume them. The Australian usage commentator Murray-Smith (1989), himself an educationalist, recommended educator for all applications."

		"title": "-ee",
		"explanation":"This ending appears on English words for a number of reasons. Apart from a few simple ones like knee and tree, such words are often foreign loanwords in which -ee is the best way to represent the final syllable in English. So it stands instead of the final i in Hindi loanwords such as dungaree, kedgeree and suttee; and in chimpanzee, borrowed from a Bantu language. Yet its most common use in English is as counterpart to the French use of e´ for the past participle, a usage which was established in English law when legal matters were still discussed in hybrid French and English. Many of the words with the -ee suffix are ones which designate a legal or quasi-legal role, such as: \n appellee arrestee assignee consignee \n deportee franchisee grantee internee \n lessee libelee licensee mortgagee \n parolee patentee payee trustee \n Yet as the last example shows, such words can become part of everyday language, as is unquestionably the case with: \n absentee addressee amputee conferee \n devotee divorcee employee escapee \n evacuee examinee interviewee nominee \n referee returnee trainee \n The legal or bureaucratic associations of many of these words have nevertheless given -ee a formal and organizational flavor; and this is no doubt part of the joke in ad hoc words such as bumpee, quizzee, holdupee, formed with everyday verbs. The suffix is productive in many contexts. \n The words in the lists above show that -ee words do not necessarily form a pair with ones ending in -er/-or. The cases which do, like employee/employer and lessee/lessor, are probably fewer than those like addressee or devotee which do not. The list also shows that -ee words are not necessarily passive, as is sometimes said. Examples such as conferee, escapee, standee could only be active in meaning (see active verbs); and others such as absentee and retiree have developed active meanings though they may have originated as passives. Recent examples noted by Bauer (1994) use -ee in referring to inanimates in the realms of grammar and linguistics – cliticee, determinee – and to corporate entities: franchisee, takee. A prototype for the latter could be found in committee, and originally it too referred to a single person to whom some duty was assigned. Only from C17 on did it become the word for the group with a collective brief. \n Note that -ee is sometimes a respelling of the informal suffix -ie, especially in some words associated with children, such as bootees and coatee. Brand names such as Softees are also formed with it. See further under -ie/-y."

		"title": "-eer",
		"explanation":"First and foremost, this suffix serves to identify a person by whatever item they engage with in their work, as with engineer, mountaineer, puppeteer. A number of such words have been used in connection with military personnel, including cannoneer, charioteer, musketeer, rocketeer, and this seems to have paved the way for its use in civilian forms of contention, as in auctioneer, electioneer, pamphleteer. This in turn may have helped to attach a derogatory flavor to words with -eer, as with profiteer, racketeer and (black) marketeer. The negative implications of (black) marketeer were exploited in Britain by those reluctant to join the Common Market, as they called the European Economic Community. \n Derogatory implications also infect these words when they appear as verbs. There are connotations of excess in profiteering and racketeering, and relentlessness, as in commandeer and domineer, though they are loanwords from Dutch. But pioneer and volunteer are free of any derogatory or contentious associations, whether as nouns or verbs. In each case they were borrowed ready-made into English, and cannot be analyzed in the same way as the English formations. \n ♦ Compare -ier."

		"title": "effective, efficient, efficacious or effectual",
		"explanation":"These words are all about getting things done and having the desired effect, but the first two have many more applications than the third and fourth. Efficacious is now used principally to refer to medicines, and remedies secular and spiritual: efficacious pills, efficacious death, efficacious balm in troubles. Despite those examples of its attributive use, it most often occurs as a predicative adjective, as in: \n . . . made no claim that such prayers were efficacious \n (See adjectives section 1.) With these constraints on its use, and its rarity, efficacious is now a lofty synonym for effective. \n Effective has expanded its domain continually since C15, when it was a scholarly word, and even since C17 and C18, when it had particular uses in military and technical contexts. It can now be used in relation to almost anything that achieves the intended result, from effective advertising to effective parenting. It refers to objects and instruments, as well as methods and strategies, and even to people who harness and mobilize others’ efforts towards a particular goal, such as an effective chairman. In some contexts effective carries the meaning of “being in force,” as in prices effective until December 31. Very occasionally it means “in fact,” as in took effective control of the city. \n Efficient is most often applied to people who don’t waste time or energy and other resources in fulfilling particular tasks, such as an efficient waiter. It can also be applied to engines and machinery which give relatively large amounts of power in relation to their consumption: more fuel-efficient than the previous model. \n A fourth word to consider in this set is effectual, which once served as an alternative to effective or efficacious. In law it’s still used to mean “valid” or “binding.” But in ordinary usage the sense of “effectiveness” survives only in the negative ineffectual, used mostly to describe a person who fails to meet the demands of a task."

As a lower case abbreviation, e.g. is still typically accorded stops (see abbreviations) – at least in American English. In British English it increasingly does without them, and appears as eg in more than a third of the examples in the BNC. The third alternative eg. was very rare in both British and American corpora. \n The punctuation before and after e.g. has long been the subject of prescription. A comma used to be considered necessary after it, and is still usual, according to the Chicago Manual (2003). But most style guides now dispense with the following comma, and simply emphasize having one before it. Other punctuation marks, such as a dash, colon or opening parenthesis could equally well come before it, depending on the structure of the sentence. \n The propriety of using e.g. in one’s writing has also been subject to taboos and restrictions. Generations of editors have translated it into “for example” whenever it appeared in running text, because it was deemed suitable only for footnotes (according to Fowler, 1926) or tables and parentheses (Chicago Manual). The Manual still associates the use of e.g. in running text strictly with science and technology. The Australian government Style Manual is more equivocal, hedging the observation that e.g. and other Latin abbreviations are in regular use with the view that they are undesirable in “more formal publications” – except when they contain many shortened forms. Other style and usage guides are more accommodating. Canadian English Usage (1997) notes that e.g. occurs in writing of “all kinds.” As far as Cambridge University Press is concerned, the decision is up to the authors, and e.g. is used freely on the expository pages of Copy-editing (1992). \n ♦ Compare i.e. and see further under Latin abbreviations."

From this the egoist comes to be someone who finds more interest in himself or herself than anyone else. Egotist derives from egotism, a word used in C18 stylistic discussions to refer to writing which makes excessive use of the first person (I ). But as egotism becomes the outward expression of egoism, the two words converge, and dictionaries recognize that they can be synonyms. Both can nowadays refer to self-important behavior of any kind, whether it is boasting about one’s achievements, or building public monuments to oneself. In American English, egotist seems to be the commoner of the two words, by the evidence of CCAE.

Only older can now be used freely in comparative structures such as X is older (?elder) than Y, and applied to objects, abstracts and people in any social group from students to pensioners. Elder/eldest is mostly confined to ranking the siblings in the family, and to frames such as his elder sister, their eldest son, at least in British English. Americans, Canadians and Australians know these usages also, though they can just as well say his older sister, their oldest son. But Americans also make extensive use of elder in contrasting the older generation with the younger, as when saying: \n The elder Whitfields will have their own place. \n (i.e. separate from their daughter and grandson) \n Or when comparing the elder Bergman’s greatest achievement with that of his youngest son, also a film director. Elder thus commonly appears preceding a proper name. It can even be a company name, as in the elder PRI power brokers, stressing generational differences in corporate culture. American English also uses elder to mean “older person,” as in the expression elder care, now contrasted with child care. Being elder-friendly is also on the socio-cultural agenda in some quarters. \n These things apart, elder appears worldwide in the expression elder statesman, and in Britain in elder partner (used for the senior partner in a business). In these, elder has shifted its emphasis from age to relative seniority and experience, as also when used as a noun to refer to the senior members of a clan (e.g. Aboriginal elders), or the lay officers of certain Protestant churches. This shift is also implicit in the expression no respect for their elders, when neither the experience of age, nor age itself, seem to be given their due."

Because elementary connotes lack of knowledge and experience, it can also be used as a put-down, as in the proverbial “Elementary, my dear Watson” of Sherlock Holmes. However all elementariness is relative, and it’s a relatively advanced mathematics student who can take elementary nonhomogeneous linear differential equations in his or her stride. When physicists speak of elementary particles, or chemists of elementary substances, the discourse is likely to be technical and demanding. \n Elemental relates to older notions about nature. When the physical world was believed to be formed out of the four elements of earth, air, fire and water, elemental was the relevant adjective.

		"title": "ellipsis",
		"explanation":"Both grammarians and editors make use of this term. In grammar, ellipsis means the omission of a word or words which would complete or clarify the sentence. In punctuation practice, ellipsis refers to the mark, usually a set of three dots ( ... ), which shows where something has been consciously omitted from a quotation. \n 1 Ellipsis in the grammar of a sentence. Many ordinary sentences omit a word or words which could be added in to spell out the meaning and clarify the sentence structure. All the sentences below show some sort of ellipsis. The ellipted elements are shown in square brackets. \n a) They took glasses from the bar and [they took] plates from the tables. \n b) They said [that] no-one was there. \n c) The woman [that/whom] I spoke to yesterday came along. \n d) Those results are better than [those that] our team could get. \n e) They are enjoying it more than [they did] last year. \n f) Herbert loves the dog more than [he does] his wife [does]. \n g) The politics of war are more straightforward than [those of ] peace [is]. \n Note that the last two sentences have alternative meanings, depending on which of two possible points of ellipsis is addressed. The ambiguity calls our attention to the ellipsis, though most of the time it passes unnoticed. Several kinds of ellipsis, such as that of the repeated subject in a coordinated sentence (in [a]), or of the conjunction that and relative pronouns in subordinate clauses (in [b] and [c]), are well known and recognized by modern grammarians. (See further under clauses section 2 and that.) \n The ellipsis of items in comparative statements with than (as in sentences [d] to [g]) is also very common, and fuels the grammarian’s concern about the role of than: is it a preposition or a conjunction? (See further under than.) For sentences (d) and (e) it makes no difference, but for (f ) and (g), it does affect communication if there’s a shortage of context. Writers clearly need to be circumspect. \n Yet grammatical ellipsis is the hallmark of everyday conversation. In exchanges with others we continually omit elements of the sentence if they simply repeat what has gone before: \n Are you coming to lunch? Not until I’ve collected my mail. \n I’ll be gone by then. Where to? \n As the examples show, the ellipses help to connect an answer with the question, and a follow-up with a previous statement. Ellipsis is in fact part of the bonding or cohesion of such discourse (see further under coherence or cohesion). Apart from contributing to the efficiency of conversation, it is the medium through which we manipulate and expand utterances. \n 2 Ellipsis in punctuation usually means the set of dots which show where words have been omitted from a text. But because ellipsis refers in the first place to the omission itself, the term is sometimes applied to other punctuation marks whose function is the same, including asterisks, and dashes. (See further under asterisk and dashes.) To avoid ambiguity on this, some style books refer to ellipsis points, and reserve the right to discuss only the dots – as we shall. \n Most style manuals recognize the practice of using three dots for an ellipsis occurring anywhere within a sentence or between sentences. In Butcher’s Copy-editing (1992), the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) and the Australian government Style Manual (2002), the three-dot ellipsis is endorsed without question. Editing Canadian English (2000) recommends it as “sanity-saving”; and even the Chicago Manual (2003) recognizes its use for “most general works and many scholarly ones.” Still, the Chicago notes the alternative practice of using three dots for an omission within sentences, and four dots (counting in the full stop) for an omission between sentences. In its proper form it makes uneven spacing between the four dots, with the full stop set close to the final word, and the other three dots with equal space on either side of them. The difference is shown below: \n He wanted no more of it. . . . But having said that... \n The lack of means to achieve a four-dot ellipsis on older typewriters and wordprocessors left many writers and editors with no choice but to use three dots for any ellipsis. \n All the authorities agree that it’s reasonable to begin with a capital letter after an ellipsis (whether or not there was a capital at that point in the original), if the resumed quotation constitutes a fresh sentence. The reader is helped thereby. Only in legal and scholarly quotations is this consideration overruled by the need to keep every letter in the same case as the original. One other simplification of older practice with ellipsis points is dispensing with them at the start of a quotation. The opening quote marks themselves show that the words cited are an excerpt. \n Note finally that a whole line of ellipsis points can be used to indicate the omission of a line or lines of verse from a poem, or where whole paragraphs have been omitted from a prose text."

The paraphrase they suggested was whose car else, which nowadays seems stilted and unacceptable. \n Another common role of else is to combine with or as the complex conjunction or else. But in conversation it stands for both of them: \n Take the car else you’ll be late. \n This use of else as an independent conjunction occurs particularly in commands and advisory statements, in the context of direct speech. Modern dictionaries do not however recognize it, and though the Oxford Dictionary (1989) registered its use as a “quasi conjunction,” it had only a few citations from C14 and therefore marked it “obsolete.” Yet Burchfield (1996) reports some C20 citations; and the Right Word at the  Right Time (1985) found it common enough in informal speech to recommend against its use in writing. Those who write formal documents are unlikely to want to use else in this way. But there’s no reason to disallow it in other kinds of writing, where direct speech and homely advice have their place."

		"title": "elusive or allusive",
		"explanation":"These adjectives can easily be mistaken for each other in speech, being identical in most people’s pronunciation, and in some contexts rather alike in meaning: an elusive charm, an allusive comment. In both phrases the words imply that something is there and yet not there. But the different spellings confirm that they relate to different verbs (elusive to elude, and allusive to allude). Thus an elusive charm is one that eludes the beholder and cannot be pinned down, while an allusive comment just alludes to something, touching on it in passing, and not dwelling on it. Allusive and allude are usually linked with things said (or not said), while elusive and elude relate to things (or people) that disappear or escape."

		"title": "elvish, elfish or elfin",
		"explanation":"In more superstitious times, the presence of elves and elf-like behavior were of common interest, though the spelling has long vacillated between elvish and elfish. In current American English the two are still about equally used, by the evidence of CCAE, whereas in British data from the BNC, elvish has a clear majority. This accords with the stronger British support for v plurals in words which maintain them (see under -f>-v-). It also explains why Tolkien used Elvish for the name of the language in Lord of the Rings. But these days elfin is commoner than either elvish or elfish, because of its more general use to refer to small, delicate features of face or body: a thin elfin-faced girl."

		"title": "email, e-mail or E-mail",
		"explanation":"This abbreviation for electronic mail was first seen as E-mail in 1982. Since then the first element has swiftly evolved into a productive prefix (see e-), and e(-)mail is now usually seen with a lower case initial. E-mail persists in proprietorial software descriptions in British and American databases, but otherwise it’s e-mail, with scant evidence of email in textual material from CCAE or the BNC. Yet email dominates on the internet (Google, 2003), outnumbering e-mail by almost 14:1. Google puts its own weight behind email, by querying e-mail (“Did you mean email?”) when you search for it. \n Dictionaries diverge over which form to use. Merriam-Webster (2000) still has E-mail for the noun (and e-mail for the verb), whereas Wired Style (1996) makes it email, as does the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) also has email, but it’s e-mail for New Oxford (1998) and the Canadian Oxford (1998). They too are grappling with the duality of usage, where e-mail appears in edited texts but email serves for practical purposes on the internet. Editors tend to prefer e-mail because of its consistency with other e-words, and the new coinings may help it to stage a comeback. \n In grammatical terms, e(-)mail is also evolving. Being a compound of mail, it’s a collective noun first and foremost, as in lots of e-mail. But many people now use it to refer to a single message, as in an e-mail from Korea, which means it also serves as a count noun (see count and mass nouns). American dictionaries (Merriam-Webster, 2000; Canadian Oxford, 1998) already recognize this by their definitions, and others will no doubt follow suit. Internet documents searched by Google (2003) were found to contain almost 4 million examples of the plural e(-)mails, confirming its widespread use as a count noun."

	{
		"title": "e-mail style",
		"explanation":"In their epistolary style, e-mails combine elements of the memo with aspects of letter writing. The headers of e-mails identifying the sender, receiver and subject are like those of memos (see Appendix VII), as is the fact that e-mail messages often do without a salutation or subject line (see under Dear). The complimentary close associated with letters is less necessary and much more variable (see under Yours faithfully). But the language of e-mails is as variable as letters, depending on their purpose (anything from institutional management to personal communication). Thus standard English prevails at one end of the scale, and the abbreviated code of SMS or l33tsp34k at the other: see SMS."

		"title": "emend or amend",
		"explanation":"Neither of these verbs is in common use nowadays: both survive in specialist contexts. To emend is the work of scholars, as they edit individual words and expressions in older texts in order to produce a definitive version of the original. The fruits of this work are emendations. Those who amend documents are concerned with the larger substance – editors seeking to improve the contents of a draft manuscript, or legislators modifying the provisions of legal codes and constitutions. Their work results in amendments to the original text. \n The plural form amends in to make amends is a fossil of the once much wider use of amend, in references to improving one’s conduct and social behavior. Another fossil They must amend their ways is now usually expressed as mend their ways. As that example shows, mend has taken over most of the general functions of amend in modern English."

		"title": "emergence or emergency",
		"explanation":"There is a clear difference between these now, unlike many -nce/-ncy pairs (see further under that heading). Both are nouns derived from the verb emerge, with emergence serving as the abstract noun, and emergency as the highly specific one, meaning a situation which requires urgent action. The spellings became differentiated only during C19. Predictably, the word with more concrete associations is the one more frequently used. In corpus data emergency outnumbers emergence by more than 3:1."
	},
	{
		"title": "emigrant, emigré or expatriate",
		"explanation":"All these refer to someone who has emigrated away from their native country, but each word has its own implications. Emigrant expresses the plain fact that someone has moved permanently away from their country of origin, and is neutral as to the reason for their move as well as their social background. Emigre´ carries more elitist overtones, as well as the implication that the emigration was necessitated by political circumstances. Historically the word emigre´ has been associated with those who fled from the French revolutions, though it might seem applicable to those who felt obliged to flee communist revolutions in Chile, Afghanistan and Vietnam. The higher social background of emigre´ is clear when the word is contrasted with refugees, who may come from any social class. \n The term expatriate may be applied to those whose emigration was either voluntary or involuntary, though it is often applied to individuals who choose for professional reasons to live in another country, as in. \n This voluntary exile is sometimes seen as betraying a lack of patriotism, which no doubt explains why expatriate is sometimes misconstrued as expatriot. There’s some evidence of it in the US (in CCAE data), coinciding with the comment of Webster’s English Usage (1989) that it could become an acceptable variant spelling in the future. (For other examples, see folk etymology.) Meanwhile the abbreviated expat skirts around the problem, at least in more informal writing. \n ♦ For the distinctions between immigrant and migrant, see under migrant."

		"title": "eminent or imminent",
		"explanation":"While eminent is a term of commendation, meaning “outstanding,” imminent says that something is on the point of happening. Examples such as an eminent scholar and their imminent defeat show their typical uses, eminent referring to people, and imminent to events. The two are unlikely to come together in the same utterance – unless of course you’re about to be visited by an eminent person, in which case it would be possible to speak of an eminent, imminent visitor! \n Imminent and its adverb imminently both focus on events about to happen, whereas eminently has little to do with eminent. Instead it becomes an intensifier meaning “especially”or “very,” as in eminently likely. See further under intensifiers."

	{
		"title": "emoticons",
		"explanation":"This word is a blend of emotion and icon, coined in computerspeak to refer to “pressbutton” indications of emotion that can be contrived out of the standard keyboard characters. Emoticons are used freely in social e-mail and informal digital style (see under that heading). The best known emoticon is the “smiley” face made up of standard keyboard characters :>) which may be intensified to the demonic laugh :>D moderated to a wink ;>) or reduced to skepticism :>/ \n The combinations are not yet standardized, e.g. some use hyphens instead of chevrons for the nose; and some vary in meaning: so :>o can indicate surprise as well as shock. These emoticons are thus not yet a universal system of ideograms (see further under that heading), apart from the fact that a different set is used in countries such as Hong Kong and Japan (McArthur, 2000). The Asian emoticons work in the vertical plane, so that (∧ ∧) is the standard smiley, and its opposite number (Y Y) symbolizes crying. Both sets of emoticons are constrained by the horizontal line of text. We may nevertheless be looking at the prototypes of a new art form – digital mini-portraiture."

		"title": "emotive or emotional",
		"explanation":"Though both of these recognize the role of emotion, they identify it in different places. Emotive implies that emotion is raised in the audience, and a phrase such as emotive words often suggests that the speaker’s output is calculated to kindle the emotions of those listening. The word emotional simply implies that emotion was expressed by the speaker, or was characteristic of the speech itself. An emotional speech can of course have an emotive effect on the audience."

It seems to have established itself earlier in North America than in Britain, and the original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) dubbed it “rare except US.” The dictionary then gave much fuller coverage to the French form employe´, and made a point of saying that employee was used for female workers. But in its 1933 Supplement, Oxford endorsed employee as the standard English term, and the idea of a gender distinction disappeared along with the French accent. The -ee suffix is of course gender-free in many words (see -ee). Employe (without accent) is still recognized as an alternative in Merriam-Webster (2000). But in CCAE it makes up little more than 1% of all examples of the word, and no showing at all in the BNC."

		"title": "en-/in-",
		"explanation":"The French prefix en- (see previous entry) has long been interchanged with the in- prefix from Old English (meaning “in”), and the identical Latin prefix (see further under in-/im-). The vacillation between them gave alternative spellings in C18 and C19 to quite a number of verbs (e.g. endorse/indorse), and multiple forms to enmesh, also found as emmesh, inmesh, immesh. Though the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986) still record the in- forms as equal or secondary alternatives, most such words have settled on en- during the course of C20 in both British and American English. Only enclose/inclose and enfold/infold still show a little variability in spelling, by the evidence of British and American databases, though in each case the en- form is commoner by far (see enclose, enfold). The en- form is the only form current in CCAE and the BNC for: \n encompass encrust(ed) endorse \n engender engraft enlist \n enmesh enroll enshrine \n enthral(l) entrench entwine \n entwisted \n A rare exception is ingrained, which has prevailed over engrained (see ingrained). Note also impassion(ed), where im- has totally replaced the earlier em-. (See also incumbent.) \n A very few words with en-/in- variability have developed distinct meanings for the two spellings, at least in some parts of the English-speaking world. See inquire/enquire and inquiry/enquiry; insure/ensure; inure/enure."

		"explanation":"These letters represent four different English suffixes: \n ∗ a past participle ending, e.g. taken (see irregular verbs section 7) \n ∗ a rare plural ending on nouns, e.g. children (see further under plurals) \n ∗ a means of forming adjectives out of nouns, e.g. golden \n ∗ a means of forming verbs out of adjectives, e.g. sharpen \n Only the fourth of these suffixes still generates new words. The first two are fossilized, and the third is not much used except in poetic diction. \n Adjectives formed with -en are derived from single-syllabled nouns: \n ashen earthen leaden oaken \n silken wooden wool(l)en \n The -en ending implies “made out of,” and occasionally “looking as if it were made out of,” as with leaden skies and silken hair. The pattern is so simple that we might wonder why its use is so limited nowadays. One reason is that it competes with the -y suffix, which has indeed generated alternative forms for many of the words above: ashy, silky, wool(l)y. Another is that when speaking of something actually made out of lead, silk or wool, we can just as well use those words: lead batteries, silk scarves, wool carpets. So ashen, leaden, silken etc. seem to be retiring to the leisured world of literature. \n Verbs formed with -en are derived from single-syllabled adjectives (except for quieten). The regular pattern is seen in: blacken darken deafen deepen \n lessen lighten madden moisten \n redden ripen sadden smarten \n stiffen thicken whiten widen \n The verbs all imply a change of state, and as things may either be made blacker or become blacker, the verbs can be either transitive or intransitive. Words ending in m, n, l, r and any vowel are ineligible for phonetic reasons to become verbs this way, and so blacken is not matched by “greenen” or “bluen.” Verbs of this kind could once be made out of nouns, as were frighten, lengthen, strengthen, threaten, but this is no longer possible."

The expression also appears in English as deshabill ´ e´ or deshabille, or the fully anglicized form dishabille. The degree of undress implied by such expressions is very much relative to the situation, sometimes a matter of careless dress, and sometimes its incompleteness. Just how incomplete is suggested by the fact that dishabille as a noun once referred to the garment now known as a negligee (again borrowed from French). \n Other delicate French loanwords used to describe modes of dress which defy convention are decollet ´ e´ (“having a low-cut neckline”), and deboutonn ´ e´, literally “unbuttoned,” a sign of social laxness in C19. By extension deboutonn ´ e´ came to mean “ready to exchange confidences.”"

Endemic means “recurring or prevalent in a particular locality,” while epidemic carries the sense of “(spreading like) a plague,” as in shoplifting has reached epidemic proportions. Both words may represent aspects of the problem, but the writer needs to distinguish the two for discussion. \n The third member of the set pandemic was originally (in C17) an adjective meaning “occurring everywhere.” It contrasted with endemic which connects things with a particular locality. The noun pandemic, which owes something to epidemic, is used to mean “a plague which affects the whole country.” \n The tendency of these words to converge need not surprise us, given their common Greek root -demic, related to demos (“people”). Literally endemic is “in the people”; epidemic is “upon or among the people” (see further under epi-); and pandemic (“all the people”)."

		"title": "English or Englishes",
		"explanation":"English is the world’s most widespread language. Its history is one of almost continuous expansion – from being the language of a few thousand Anglo-Saxon immigrants to Britain in the fifth century AD, to being now the first or second language of at least 750 million people around the world (see Crystal, 1997). On all continents there are nation-states for which it is either the national language or one of them. \n ∗ English as national language, in: \n Australia Bahamas Barbados Canada Falklands Guyana Ireland Jamaica New Zealand South Africa Trinidad and Tobago United Kingdom United States of America \n ∗ English as auxiliary national language, in: \n Brunei Fiji Gambia Ghana Kenya Liberia Nigeria Papua-New Guinea Sierra Leone Singapore Uganda Zambia Zimbabwe \n In several other countries, English was until recently an auxiliary national language and remains a lingua franca for strategic purposes (e.g. tourism, international affairs): \n Bangladesh India Malaya Pakistan Philippines Sri Lanka Tanzania \n English is the second language of choice in China, Japan and parts of the EU. \n The volume of international communication in English is enormous. Estimates (or guesstimates) have it that 75% of the world’s mail, cables and telexes, and 80% of the information on computers is in English. It is the language of science and technology and the official medium of communication for ships and aircraft. International organizations mostly use English, whether associated with the United Nations or with sports management. So do the major financial institutions, media networks and travel organizations. Other domains of English are international law, tertiary education and in interpreting and translating, as a “relay language” (Graddol, 1997). \n  Facts like these are sometimes invoked to show that English is destined to become the universal medium of communication. But once you begin to look at the details of English in any of the countries just named, their divergences are as conspicuous as their convergence. English responds to its surroundings wherever it’s used. Even in countries where there have always been native speakers (as in the first group above), English still tends to develop new regional characteristics, and to reflect the local culture, society and environment. (See further under American English, Australian English, Canadian English, New Zealand English, South African English.) In countries like Kenya and Ghana, where English is an auxiliary national language, it rubs shoulders with other languages, borrowing from them and adjusting itself in interaction with them. In early colonial times, this sometimes saw the birth of pidgin English (see further under pidgins.) More recently it has resulted in “new Englishes” – the nativized or indigenized varieties of post-colonial societies such as India and Sri Lanka (McArthur, 1998), where English has evolved from being the second language of many citizens to being the first. \n The development of multiple varieties of English, with their own styles of pronunciation, vocabulary and idiom, suggests that the concept of “international English” is not to be taken for granted (see international English). The natural tendency towards variation can be constrained in specialized contexts such as communication with ships (“seaspeak”) and aircraft (“airspeak”), and tends to happen in the fields of science and technology. But as long as English responds to the infinitely variable needs of everyday communication in innumerable geographical and social contexts, it is bound to diversify. No single set of norms can be applied round the world, to decide what is “correct” or what forms to use. The analogy of Latin – which spread to all parts of the Roman empire and diversified into the various Romance languages – may well hold for English in the third millennium."

		"title": "English language databases",
		"explanation":"Databases of language or anything else are only as valid as the raw material they consist of. That material needs to include a stylistic range if we are to evaluate linguistic diversity and change around us. To provide broad objective evidence on current English, a number of computerized databases have been built since 1960. Linguists at Brown University, Rhode Island USA, pioneered with the Brown corpus (i.e. database) of 1 million words of written American English, sampled in clearly defined text categories (newspapers, magazines, books) on a spectrum of subjects with specialized or mass-market readerships. The British counterpart is the LOB corpus (Lancaster–Oslo/Bergen, a collaboration between Lancaster University and two in Norway), which used an equivalent range of samples from 1961. In India (Kohlhapur University), Australia (Macquarie University) and New Zealand (Victoria University), 1 million word databases exactly like Brown and LOB have since been compiled to facilitate intercomparisons of standard English in each region. A similar set of comparative corpora, each 1 million words but half of them spoken English and half written, was compiled as the International Corpus of English (ICE) in the 1990s, by researchers in more than a dozen countries where English is either a first or second official language. The website for ICE is at www.ucl.ac.uk. \n The second generation of English language databases are much larger, ranging from 25 million to over 200 million words. They have typically been compiled by dictionary publishers, including Collins, Cambridge (see CCAE), Longman and Oxford, the last two being major contributors to the British National Corpus (see further under BNC). Their reach into specialized vocabulary and changing idiom is infinitely greater than that of the first generation, and databased evidence is now regarded as fundamental to dictionaries and other language references, as well as teaching materials for ELT and ESL. The corpora ensure that language advice and information in such publications is grounded in actual usage, not dependent on the impressions and preferences of the authors."

		"title": "enormity or enormousness",
		"explanation":"Is there any difference between these, apart from their obvious difference in bulk? The short answer now is “Hardly.” But according to a usage convention dating back to late C19, there is a line of demarcation: enormousness should be used to express the notion of hugeness, vastness or immensity, while enormity carries a sense of strong moral outrage, connoting the heinousness of a deed or event. Compare: \n The enormity and futility of this raid finally swung opinion against city bombing. \n . . . the enormousnesss of the US budget deficit will mean competition . . . \n The distinction is rather difficult to maintain when the adjective enormous can now only mean “huge.” Writers reaching for its abstract noun not surprisingly tend to harness enormity rather than the cumbersome enormousness, and in fact the latter makes no showing at all amid 100 million words of the BNC. In the much larger American corpus (CCAE) there are less than 10 examples of enormousness. This naturally means that enormity (which is well represented in both databases) bears a range of senses in which moral outrage is not demonstrably a component – except as rhetorical overtone (see the first example below). The widened scale of uses for enormity ranges from that which is seriously overwhelming, to that which by its sheer size is surprisingly or amusingly beyond the norms. \n Changes threatening this country . . . are of an enormity that still has not sunk in. \n Menzies was wilting under the enormity of the work. \n . . . the enormity of the federal deficit \n . . . the enormity of Einstein’s intellect \n . . . the enormity of propelling a wheelchair 50 miles a day \n . . . his silver hair outshone only by the enormity of his rucsac \n In a humorous comment like the last, enormity has shed all its more alarming connotations. They become diluted in frequent collocations such as the enormity of the problem/task/challenge. All such uses occur in edited writing in the corpora, so they cannot be set aside on grounds of informality. The same trends and the actual levels of usage are manifest in both British and American English. This is why dictionaries in the US, UK, Australia and Canada now allow that enormity serves as a synonym for enormousness: see for example New Oxford (1998), Merriam-Webster’s (2000), Macquarie (1997), Canadian Oxford (1998). \n The Oxford Dictionary (1989) shows that enormity was around well before enormousness, and has been used since C18 to mean “hugeness.” This usage was dubbed “obsolete” with the latest citation in 1848, though an intriguing note from late C19 indicates that “More recent examples might perhaps be found, but the use is now regarded as incorrect.” Even so the Oxford found twice as many citations for enormity with that meaning as for enormousness. Common usage has never taken account of the shibboleth that somehow attached itself to the use of enormity for “vast size.” Burchfield (1996) concludes that it may be used in connection with abstracts of overwhelming size, but not physical entities. No such restrictions are mentioned in Webster’s English Usage (1989). This means that those who need to communicate a sense of outrage should not put too much faith in enormity, and would be wise to seek an alternative."

		"title": "enough",
		"explanation":"This familiar adjective-cum-adverb is normally complemented by constructions with to plus the infinitive. For example: \n They have enough money to buy their own house. (adjective) \n They are rich enough to buy their own house. (adverb) \n An alternative construction for the adverb is also on the increase: \n They’re rich enough that they could buy their own house. \n This use of a comparative clause to complement enough is well established in American English, to judge by the hundreds of examples in CCAE. \n He was an old soldier, . . . respected enough that he had some clout. \n The weather improved enough that everyone could go out. \n The experience was unpleasant enough that no president since has taken such a drastic measure. \n . . . tiny pores, small enough that water droplets can’t pass through \n . . . important enough that they not move in haste \n In several of these American examples, enough that seems to facilitate expression of the negative. But in British English the last sentence would be expressed as “for them not to move in haste,” and constructions with for plus subject (case-adjusted) plus infinitive are the usual form. There are few signs of enough complemented by a clause in data from the BNC. A rare example is: \n  America will win . . . handily enough that it will not want to withdraw from Asia. \n It remains to be seen whether the enough that construction will win Britons over."

		"title": "enroll or enrol, and enrollment or enrolment",
		"explanation":"The earliest spellings were inroll and enroll, the double l showing the word’s origins in French rolle (“roll”). However later French role seems to have destabilized the English word, fostering “enroule” in C16 and C17, and enrol in C18. Enroll and enrol are presented by Webster’s Third (1986), as equal alternatives, and also by the Oxford Dictionary (1989), but in the opposite order. The two spellings are however strongly associated with American and British English respectively. This regional divergence stamps itself on the present tense of the verb, where American writers use I/you/we/they enroll and s/he enrolls, as well as enrollment for the noun. British writers have a single l in all of them, but still use two ls in the past tense (enrolled) because of the stress (see doubling of final consonant). Canadians and Australians go both ways, some taking advantage of the more consistent American spelling, others following British practice. A Google search in 2002 found enroll in more than a third of Australian documents on the internet. \n International English selection: The spelling enroll is preferable on grounds of etymology, its wide distribution, and its consistency throughout the paradigm. \n ♦ For the curious history of English spellings with one l, see single for double.

Given that the word consists of en- and thrall, the spelling with two ls has everything to recommend it. The original C16 spelling gave the word two ls, but it was subject to the C18 fashion of trimming double final consonants (see single for double).

So on entering the exhibition you could be charged either an entrance fee (because it is at the gate) or an entry fee (which secures your right to go in). An official NO ENTRY sign makes access by that route illegal, whether or not it’s physically impossible. \n In database evidence, entrance is most often a built structure, as in main entrance and entrance foyer; while entry is often more metaphorical, as in entry into the war and student entry to Computing Science. Entry has further developed to mean “something entered,” such as a note in a diary or an account book, or an item in a competition. \n Both nouns are loanwords from French, entry borrowed in C14 and entrance in C16.

		"title": "epithet",
		"explanation":"The applications of this word are different in scholarly and common usage. Literary scholars apply epithet to an adjective, and to a compound adjective if it’s a Homeric epithet like the “rosy-fingered (dawn).” These uses may perhaps have given rise to the mistaken notion that epithets should not be negative (Gowers, 1965), although Johnson’s 1755 dictionary had defined epithet as a term with either negative or positive qualities, as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) still does. This is certainly in line with its application to the nicknames of celebrated or notorious persons, as in Gregory the Great or Ivan the Terrible. Note that the nickname need not consist simply of an adjective, as in those cases. \n But common use of epithet and especially epithets also makes it a euphemism for the abusive words or names flung in anger or contempt (including swear words). The usage is well established in American English, to judge by numerous examples in CCAE, such as: \n . . . cars were often spray-painted with racial epithets by white kids. \n . . . demonstrators chanted raucous epithets and hurled eggs at the embassy \n Thus epithets often connotes public verbal aggression targeting minorities. Only occasionally are epithets themselves reported . . . \n . . . pansy, fairy, nance, fruit, fruitcake and less printable epithets \n This antisocial use of epithet is recognized in Webster’s Third (1986), but not yet in British dictionaries. The very first signs of its use in British English are nevertheless to be found in the BNC: Italians only find skiing interesting when they’re shouting epithets or carving each other up. \n We were treated to epithets which no Merton man would have allowed to pass his lips in mixed company. \n But as the examples show, this use of epithets in British English is (pro tem) a matter of ad hoc abuse and swear words, not the symptom of a broader antisocial agenda."

		"title": "eponymous or eponymic",
		"explanation":"Some dictionaries such as Webster’s Third (1986) present these adjectives as synonyms and variants of each other, whereas others such as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) treat them more independently. Either way eponymous is given priority, and applied to the person (or proper name) after whom something is named, as in: \n Andrew Brownswood of the eponymous greetings card maker \n The eponymous narrator of Spider (it’s a nickname his mother called him) \n Hydro Mississauga Ltd of the eponymous Ontario town \n Like the eponymous Statue, the word “liberty” comes from French. \n As these examples from BNC and CCAE show, eponymous can now be applied to proper names vested in products, compositions, businesses, institutions, as well as diseases and the placenames and names of nationalities and tribal groups (like Colombo, American) to which it was once confined. (See further under Columbia and America.) \n The Oxford connects eponymic directly with the noun eponym, which might give it independent scope but for the fact that only the older senses of that word are registered – those referring to the name-giver (which render the underlying Greek more closely) not the more recent use of eponym to refer to the name/word derived (see eponyms, final paragraph). The New Oxford (1998) which does recognize the latter sense doesn’t mention eponymic, only eponymous. A further complication is that eponymic is extremely rare (only one example in CCAE, none at all in the BNC). So for the moment eponymic is waiting in the wings, while eponymous does double duty for both older and newer meanings of eponym. See next entry."

		"explanation":"Some people gain a curious immortality when their surnames become the byword (and eventually the common word) for a particular product or a practice. The sandwich originated this way (named after the portable lunch associated with the Earl of Sandwich, 1718–92); and braille is the eponymous name for the tactile system which enables the blind to read, invented by Frenchman Louis Braille 1809–52. Bloomers take their name from the American feminist Amelia Bloomer 1818–91. Eponyms sometimes perpetuate a nickname, as in the case of grog. “Old Grog” (referring to his grogram cloak) was the nickname of Admiral Edward Vernon (1684–1757), who reputedly added water to the sailors’ rations of rum, and so lent his nickname to diluted alcoholic spirits of any kind. In Australia and New Zealand his nickname has become the byword for cheap forms of liquor. \n The items or behavior to which eponyms refer are not necessarily a credit to the family name, yet many are no worse than household words: \n biro boycott brougham bunsen \n cardigan clerihew derby doily \n guillotine leotard macintosh morse \n pullman quisling shrapnel silhouette \n wellingtons \n A more select group of eponyms are the ones specifically chosen by the community of scientists to refer to units of measurement, including: \n ampere coulomb henry joule \n  newton ohm pascal watt \n The complete list is to be found in Appendix IV. \n Note that eponyms do not need to be capitalized because they work as common nouns, and are no longer proper names. Their assimilation into the common vocabulary is even more complete in cases where they provide the basis for new complex words, as with: \n bowdlerize chauvinism galvanize \n macadamize mesmerize nicotine \n pasteurize sadism spoonerism \n Eponyms abound in the names of flora, celebrating botanists and horticulturalists of many nationalities: \n banksia bauhinia camellia clarkia \n fuchsia poinciana poinsettia wistaria \n These names are written with lower case when they’re used as the common name for the plant. However when used as the name of the botanical genus, and accompanied by a species name, they are capitalized. See further under capital letters section 1e. \n This use of eponym to refer to common words derived from proper names (rather than to the name-giver himself or herself) is relatively recent – not recognized in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), though New Oxford (1998) knows it. Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000) anticipate it by reference to a “name derived from / based on [a proper name].” It works of course on the analogy of other linguistic terms such as synonym, antonym, hyponym."

Equitable comes by a less direct path through French, and is associated with equity. It therefore means “even-handed,” and implies the fair and just disposition of human affairs, as in an equitable arrangement. We trust that judges will deal equitably with the matters before them. \n The two words are occasionally interchanged by mistake – as in equitable weather which then carries the whimsical suggestion that “someone up there” might control the climate, and prevent it from raining indifferently “on the just and the unjust,” as the King James bible has it."

Should it be: \n adapter or adaptor \n adviser or advisor \n ∗appointer or appointor \n ∗assurer or assuror \n ∗attester or attestor \n attracter or attractor \n attributer or attributor \n conjurer or conjuror \n ∗connecter or connector \n constructer or constructor \n convener or convenor \n conveyer or conveyor \n ∗deviser or devisor \n disrupter or disruptor \n ∗exciter or excitor \n  ∗executer or executor \n ∗granter or grantor \n ∗licenser or licensor \n mortgager or mortgagor \n ∗resister or resistor \n ∗settler or settlor \n ∗warranter or warrantor \n The pairs in bold are discussed at their own entries in this book. Those asterisked are cases where the -er form is the one in general use, and the -or one is for specialists, usually in science, technology or law. The remainder are just a token of the ever-increasing group where there are both -er and -or agent words, and either can be used. \n 1 Words with -er. Overall there’s no doubt that the -er group is growing at the expense of the -or group. This is because almost all agent words based on English verbs are formed that way. The -er suffix can identify people in terms of their work, their recreation or their behavior: \n baker dancer drinker \n driver hiker producer \n runner smoker teacher \n wrecker \n The suffix is also commonly used to designate machines and instruments by their function: \n decanter dispenser divider propeller \n The -er ending is also the normal one for ad hoc formations, in phrases such as a prolonger of meetings or an inviter of trouble. Any agent words which are not listed in dictionaries you can safely spell with -er. \n 2 Words with -or. The most significant group of agent words with -or are Latin or neo-Latin in origin. Note especially those based on verbs ending in -ate, for example: \n agitator calculator demonstrator \n elevator illustrator operator \n precipitator radiator spectator \n With other Latin verb groups, the endings are increasingly mixed. Older agentives such as conductor, contributor, director, instructor, investor retain the -or, while younger ones with latinate stems have -er, for example: \n computer contester digester \n distracter molester presenter \n promoter protester respecter \n The older ones with -or can sometimes be identified by the fact that their standard meaning has moved some distance away from the formative verb, and seems to designate a role rather than a specific action, e.g. conductor. The new formations with -er express the ordinary meaning of the verb. \n Note that the -or ending also goes with certain Latin loanwords such as doctor, impostor which clearly cannot have been formed from verbs in modern English. (There is no verb “doct” or “impost.”) Other examples are: \n divisor incisor interlocutor monitor \n precentor sponsor transistor victor \n Also spelled with -or are a number of medieval loanwords from French, such as: \n conqueror counsellor governor juror \n  purveyor surveyor survivor \n Their -or endings are actually a result of their being respelled in early modern English according to the Latin model. In short, you may expect -or spellings with older loanwords from either Latin or French, and with younger formations based on verbs ending in -ate. \n 3 A case for spelling reform? Because the -er ending is the dominant one for agent words in modern English, it would make excellent sense to allow writers to use it even with those which have traditionally been spelled -or, so as to remove the artificial distinction between computer and calculator, between demonstrator and protester etc. No vital meaning would be lost in such cases, and it would relieve writers of the unnecessary anxiety about the remaining -or spellings. If -er were used in all cases where there was a lively English verb, as in calculater, demonstrater, instructer, invester, spelling would be more predictable for true agent words. We could still allow for continuing use of -or in words which cannot be interpreted as agentives, such as author, doctor, sponsor, tailor, traitor, in which the ending seems to be part of the identity of the word. See spelling, rules and reforms sections 1 and 4."

Field linguists use ergative to refer to the inflection of nouns as the subject of a transitive verb, when the inflection contrasts with that of the subject of an intransitive verb. An ergative language has different inflections for these two kinds of subject, and the inflection for the intransitive subject is the same as that of the object of the transitive verb (see further under cases, and transitive and intransitive). \n English has no ergative marking for its nouns, and the term has instead been applied to verbs whose subjects are not agents but “patients” of the action. For example: \n The kettle boiled. \n This hotel is renovating. \n Wax will melt under low heat. \n The gap has widened between rich and poor. \n Recent research (McMillion, 1998) suggests that ergative uses of verbs may be on the increase, and especially in British English. Like the agentless passive, ergative constructions allow the writer to report negative facts without pinpointing the agency involved: \n If the situation worsens, the citizens will need your support. \n The same construction is also known as the “unaccusative.” See further under middle voice."

		"title": "escapee or escaper",
		"explanation":"Escapee is established throughout the English-speaking world as the term for someone who escapes from prison or some other confining institution. It appeared in later C19, one of its earliest applications being to French convicts who escaped from New Caledonia to Australia, 1881 \n The word escaper is actually older, if we count an isolated example in the King James bible of 1611, or even the first one recorded after that in 1844. With its -er suffix, it seems a more regular formation than escapee – especially if one assumes that -ee is a passive suffix, which was Fowler’s reason for preferring escaper. But not all -ee words are passive in meaning (see -ee), and the fact that -ee is often found on legal or bureaucratic words makes it apt for one who declines to remain a “guest” of the government. This may explain the popularity of escapee in Australia and America (where it outnumbers escaper by almost 15:1 in data from CCAE). In Britain the two are much more evenly matched, though BNC data still puts escapee in the majority. \n  Other agent words based on escape belong to different worlds altogether.

		"explanation":"The strong black coffee made by Italians is espresso, literally “expressed or drawn out under pressure.” The method relies on pressurized steam to extract the flavorsome liquid from ground coffee beans. The spelling expresso anglicizes the word and suggests a folk etymology, that it offers you a fast cup of coffee. Although expresso can be seen on menus, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), it’s not so common in edited prose in either American or British English. \n In data from both CCAE and the BNC, espresso outnumbers expresso by more than 10:1. \n Like most Italian loanwords espresso takes an English plural and a simple s at that: espressos (see further under -o.) However where Italy’s haute cuisine is being served, you may hear the plural espressi, naturally enough. See further under Italian plurals."

		"title": "Esq.",
		"explanation":"This abbreviation for Esquire once appeared regularly on letterheads and envelopes, as a courtesy title for those who could not claim a title such as Sir, Dr., Professor etc., and were not in clerical orders, but were “gentlemen” by virtue of birth, position or education. This represented a large extension of earlier usage, whereby the title Esquire was only accorded to the higher gentry, those ranking next to knights. Nowadays the use of Mr. before men’s names has effectively taken the place of Esq. (See further under forms of address.) But in the UK older correspondents still make some use of it, and BNC data registers both historical and current (courtesy) use of it: \n In the 18th century it was the property of Arthur Eggington Esq JP. \n Tuesday evening: W. B. Scott. Esq. in the Chair. \n In current American English, the abbreviation Esq. is not common, but sometimes found after the surnames of professional persons, provided no other title (such as Dr., Mr., Ms., Hon.) prefaces the name. \n Mitchell Stephens Esq., a hotshot lawyer from New York \n As in that example, it’s often suffixed to the names of people associated with the law, including attorneys, clerks of court, and justices of the peace. In both the US and Canada, it can be used after the surnames of woman lawyers, as well as their male counterparts."

		"title": "-esque",
		"explanation":"This ending, found in English picturesque, is a clone of French pittoresque, and somewhat productive in generating ad hoc adjectives out of proper names, as in Clintonesque, Chaplinesque, Turneresque meaning “in the style or manner of (the person named).” As in those examples, -esque words are usually coined out of two-syllabled names. The French connection gives the word a je ne sais quoi of sophistication, all the more evident when you compare it with -ish, which is its Germanic cognate in English. See further under -ish."
	},
	{
		"title": "-ess",
		"explanation":"This suffix, borrowed from French, is loaded with gender, and its raison d’etre ˆ in the past has been to draw specific attention to the female of the species (with animals, as in lioness), and to the female incumbents of particular roles and occupations (as in air-hostess and waitress). The latter have come under fire as conspicuous examples of sexism in language, and ones which devalue women’s participation in the work force. This problem has been felt with all of the following: \n actress authoress conductress \n deaconess directress editress \n manageress mayoress poetess \n proprietress sculptress stewardess \n The feminine ending tends to distract attention from the nature of the occupation itself, making it somehow different from that of the author, deacon, manager etc.: it seems to demean the work of the woman who does it. For the actress it’s a particular dilemma, since gender is essential to the parts they play, and well rewarded in starring roles. But among the rank and file, some women prefer to call themselves actors. In other professions, female professionals have solved the problem in the same way, by identifying themselves authors, editors, managers etc. Occasionally a synonym or paraphrase can be used, e.g. flight attendant for stewardess. These and other solutions are discussed in the Handbook of Nonsexist Writing (1988), and firmly enjoined by many publishers. For editors and writers, the alternative expression must not be cumbersome, nor leave any doubt that the same occupation is being referred to. (See further under inclusive language.) \n Other words of this kind do not really undermine women’s rights to equal opportunity in the job market. Some are traditional titles: countess, duchess, princesss; some designate specific female social roles, such as heiress, hostess, mistress, patroness which may need to be identified from time to time. Yet others are just literary fictions, like enchantress, goddess, shepherdess. Occasional or literary use of such words hardly poses any threat to the status of women at large; and where they relate to vanishing traditions, they will die a natural death. The -ess will simply become an archaic and irrelevant suffix. \n ♦ For the use of -ess in ethnic terms, see Jewess, and negress."

Today’s university and college students who write essays and papers are their heirs only in the sense that they use them as a vehicle for discussion. Their essays/papers are usually written on prescribed topics, and few would risk “flying a kite” in an assessable exercise. Having duly mastered the art of essay writing, students graduate to positions in which they never use that form of communication, and letters, reports and memorandums are the order of the day.

	{
		"title": "etc.",
		"explanation":"This abbreviation is usually written with a stop, though this assumes an editorial policy of using stops for lower case abbreviations (see further at abbreviations section 2). The stop is used more consistently in American than British English, by database evidence from CCAE and the BNC. But either way, the stop on etc. is subsumed by the final full stop when it occurs at the end of a sentence. \n Etc. is regularly printed in roman, not italics (see further under italics). Making etc. a joint character with ampersand – &c – is not recommended nowadays. Etc., standing for et cetera, is the best known Latin abbreviation in English. The Latin words in it are pronounced in full, unlike e.g. and i.e. which are simply said as initialisms. Further evidence of its assimilation is the fact that there’s no standardized translation for it as there is for e.g. and i.e. Authors and editors translate etc. variously as “and so forth,” “and so on,” “and such like,” “and the like” or “and others,” which again shows the gradual extension of its use. It also works as a fully fledged word etcetera, and it becomes a colloquial noun etceteras with the regular English plural ending. \n The original Latin phrase et cetera means “and the rest” or “and the others,” implying a known set of items which might be used to complete the list preceding it. It relieves the writer of the need to list them, and calls on the reader to supply them. However etc. is quite often used more loosely to mean “and others,” which presumes nothing of the reader, and just notes that the list is incomplete. Strictly speaking etc. refers to things, not people, because the -a makes it neuter in gender. For references to people, the Latin abbreviation et al. (short for et alii, literally “and other persons”) is available. (See further under Latin abbreviations.) \n  Punctuation with etc. In spite of its thorough assimilation, the use of etc. has traditionally been discouraged (along with other abbreviations), and hedged about with rules. The use of commas with it has been the subject of editorial prescription: that there should be a comma before it if the preceding list consisted of at least two items (but not if there was only one); and that there must be a comma after it, except when it was the last word in a sentence. Most style authorities now take a more liberal line. Butcher’s Copy-editing (1992) asks only for editorial consistency in either using or not using a comma before and/or after etc.; and the Chicago Manual of Style (2003) relaxes the requirement to use a comma afterwards. In Canada, both older and newer styles coexist, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). The Australian government Style Manual (1994) adds that the comma before etc. is only needed when the sentence might otherwise be misconstrued. When it follows a list, etc. is connected by intonation with the previous word, and the comma would be intrusive. Hence its absence in: in government, defence, production etc. or the growing of camellias, rhododendrons, pieris etc. – among British examples from the BNC. So the “framing” of etc. with commas is no longer considered essential, and left to authors’ and editors’ discretion. \n 2 The use of etc. in various kinds of writing. Like other abbreviations, etc. has been thought unsuitable for many kinds of writing. Strunk and White (1972) called it “a misfit” in formal writing. Butcher (1992) noted the publisher’s convention of replacing etc. with an English paraphrase, but she advises conferring with the author over it. The Chicago Manual (1993) is still unenthusiastic about using etc. in “formal prose,” and would have it confined to lists, tables and parentheses. What “formal” means in all this is uncertain. Webster’s English Usage (1989) finds that etc. is common in expository writing, and Canadian English Usage (1997) that it’s more frequent in academic writing than newspapers and magazines. The evidence of databases in the US and the UK is that it occurs in most of the nonfiction genres sampled; and in the Australian ACE database it registered in all types of nonfiction and 5 out of 8 categories of fiction. The traditional restrictions on the appearances of etc. are evidently being lifted in many parts of the English-speaking world. \n What problem etc. could present is rarely discussed, though according to The Right Word at the Right Time (1985), it is inelegant and/or discourteous to the reader, and lays the writer open to charges of being lazy or short of information. Yet all such matters are relative to the medium of writing, and to the level of detail required. The writer who supplies a plethora of information is unlikely to be thought careless or ignorant because of an occasional etc. Rather it can be seen as signaling the writer’s desire to limit the range of examples for discussion, to keep it focused. Stylistically speaking, etc. is more efficient than the wordy “translations” used to replace it. But like any stylistic device, it becomes obtrusive with overuse. This means a continuing role for its English paraphrases, as well as complementary devices such as for example, such as, for instance, which can be used at the beginning of the list instead of the end. Along with etc., all are elements of a well-stocked writer’s repertoire."

		"title": "ethnic",
		"explanation":"This word has always been subject to ethnocentricity, i.e. the tendency to take one’s own culture as the reference point in judging any others. In early Christian usage it meant “heathen,” while C20 and C21 writers often use it to identify any culture other than their own. Ethnic thus often means “not of the mainstream,” and acquires the connotations of “strange and exotic,” as in ethnic food or woollen cardigan with ethnic embroidery. In these collocations, ethnic clearly has a commodity value. The downside of such usage is its apparent lack of discrimination among cultures other than one’s own – a tendency to lump them all together. This is not helped by common expressions such as ethnic minorities, ethnic disturbances, ethnic tensions, where institutional acknowledgement of racial and cultural difference still seems to project mainstream assumptions, and gloss over whatever problems need to be identified. Of course ethnic is the appropriate adjective in abstract discussions of racial and cultural identity, when speaking of an ethnic group or the ethnic mix of the American population. But in newspaper reports on ethnic violence, it’s symptomatic of the very social problem it purports to document – a reluctance to identify with disadvantaged and marginal groups. Within the mainstream, ethnic jokes perpetuate only racial/cultural stereotypes, and scarcely provide inclusive amusement for all. (See further at inclusive language.) \n The newish noun ethnic(s) is similarly used by members of the social mainstream – in North America and Australia, but not much in Britain – to imply a cultural divide between themselves and immigrants or members of minority groups: In California we’re used to ethnics. The plural form creates a collective pigeonhole which too easily carries negative messages, as in: \n His path is peopled by rednecks, ethnics, feminists . . .  \n . . . interviewed . . . white ethnics, blacks, Latinos and Asians \n Only certain ethnics seem to be acceptable. \n What’s lacking in such references is proper recognition of the individual cultures and identities involved. (See further under racist language.) In more careful writing, ethnic combines with specific national names, such as ethnic Germans (in Poland or the US), ethnic Turks (in Bulgaria), to indicate the particular group whose interests are a matter of concern. \n As is evident, ethnic is a troubling word which tends to privilege the mainstream culture at the expense of others. Some of the usages outlined above are nonprejudicial and legitimate; but in others the word is simply a front for stereotypical racial/cuItural assumptions. It should give pause for thought."

Broadly speaking, the alternative spellings reflect American/British difference where medicine and pathology are concerned (see further under ae/e), though there is a sprinkling of etiology among medical references in the BNC. In the other professions it’s more an individual matter. For some European philosophers etiology is the preferred spelling, as it was for the astronomer Halley.

		"title": "-ette",
		"explanation":"This suffix borrowed from French has three main uses in English, to mean: \n 1 “small” (as in kitchenette, rosette) \n 2 “female” (as in suffragette, usherette) \n 3 “substitute” (as in leatherette, flannelette) \n The first use of -ette has generated a few common terms, such as couchette, dinette, diskette, flatette, sermonette, statuette, where the suffix serves as necessary (and sometimes rueful) recognition that the size and scope of the object are diminished in comparison with any archetypes you may think of. The supermarkette in an Australian country town makes no false promises. The second meaning has had little use in English generally, although it was productive in America in the earlier half of this century, in formations like bachelorette, freshette, (drum-)majorette, sailorette for the members of certain (younger) female groups. Occasionally they were formed from proper names, as in Latin Quarterettes, the Centaurettes, and the Topeka Co-operettes (the women’s auxiliary of the city Co-operative Club). Undergraduette had some vogue in Britain between the wars. But the pressure to do away with gender-specific suffixes goes against it now, reinforced by satirical male-chauvinist creations such as bimbette, editorette, whizzette. (See sexism in language.) In the names of fabrics such as leatherette, -ette serves to denote a product that is either a substitute for or an imitation of an old-established material. Flannelette and the British winceyette are further examples. \n Loanwords with -ette. The use of the -ette ending is somewhat variable with bassinet(te), briquet(te), epaulet(te), as well as musical terms like minuet(te), quartet(te), quintet(te), sextet(te). It appears in full in cultural or consumer contexts where its French connotations are most valued (see further under frenchification). More functional loanwords which had earlier had -ette were trimmed back to -et, as happened with numerous French loanwords like budget, bullet, facet, pocket, rivet, tablet, turret. Other significant examples are toilet and omelet: see individual entries."

		"title": "etymology",
		"explanation":"This is the study of the origins and individual history of words: what languages they came from, and how their meaning and form have changed over the course of time. It confronts us with the mutability of language, although etymological knowledge has been used to try to prevent language change. Etymologies are sometimes used to identify an “original” form or meaning for a word, which is then held up as true for all time. This was the basis for a number of the strangest spellings of English, such as debt, indict, receipt, whose Latin ancestors (debitum, indictare, receptum) are invoked in the letters b, c and p, added during C15/16. The etymological letters were and are superfluous in terms of our pronunciation of those words, which is based on French. Likewise, the fact that aggravate contains the Latin root gravmeaning “heavy, serious” moves some people to insist that the English word can only mean “make more serious,” and ought not to mean “annoy.” \n Etymological arguments about language are ultimately arbitrary, choosing a fixed point in time (such as classical Latin) as the reference point for language questions. But usage stretches still further back in time. Many Latin words had Greek antecedents, and they can be traced back to Indo-European. See further under Indo-European, and spelling. \n Apart from scholarly uses of etymology, there’s no doubt that ordinary users of a language like to see a word’s meaning reflected in its form or spelling. Words sometimes adjust their spelling in response to an assumed etymology. In cases like bridegroom, the etymon (“original word or form”) now enshrined in the spelling is quite wrong. See further under folk etymology."

		"title": "euphemisms",
		"explanation":"Euphemisms are the fine-sounding words and phrases we use for things which are not so fine or beautiful. The word itself goes back to the Greeks and Greek civilization, suggesting that they had found the need for inoffensive expressions to refer to what was unpalatable, unacceptable and unmentionable in their culture. A little later Cicero wrote about euphemisms in letters to his friends (Epistolae ad Familiares IX). Contemporary linguistic research suggests that they occur in most languages, and even across languages, for bilingual speakers. \n Any culture has its taboo subjects, and will find euphemisms for referring to them when reference is unavoidable. The basic bodily functions are a common focus of euphemisms in contemporary English, hence the use of go to the bathroom for urinate, and have intercourse for copulate. Presumably most people feel some inhibitions or distaste about referring to them. Such euphemisms however are a relatively small group by comparison with those created by our social and political institutions, as part of their public rhetoric and as a means to avoid confronting people with uncomfortable and disturbing facts. The funeral industry does it with terms such as casket (for coffin), and professional car (for hearse). It has created the blended term cremains, to reduce people’s awareness that they are dealing with cremated remains. The Australian government does it with the higher education contribution scheme or HECS, which atte ´mpts to put a positive spin on an educational l`evy which generally strikes a negative chord. In various parts of the English-speaking world, the process of privatisation/privatization looks increasingly like a name for the withdrawal of government services. Perhaps the euphemistic phrase ethnic cleansing helped to retard outsiders’ responses to the sinister practices that led to Yugoslavia’s deconstruction in the 1990s. \n Apart from masking the awful truth, euphemisms help to “dress things up,” when people want to lend status to something – as when barbers call themselves hair consultants, and when what used to be called “cooking” is referred to as home science. But euphemisms with pretensions can easily develop ironic overtones and begin to parody themselves. The burglar alarm expert who calls himself a security executive will soon need to find a new job title, if people are to take him seriously. One of the chronic problems with euphemisms is their built-in obsolescence. Hardly has a new one become established before its unmentionable past catches up with it. The turnover in terms for the public toilet: WC, conveniences, rest rooms etc., is well-known evidence, and we may wonder how long even the male and female icons for them can survive. \n The search for replacement euphemisms can also be a source of comedy, and some seem deliberately aimed at comic effect. The phrases used to allude to a person’s madness are legion, as round the bend becomes round the twist, not the full quid becomes a sandwich short of a picnic. The joke helps to cushion us from the disturbing reality of mental deterioration. Euphemisms and writing. Euphemisms are a resource for tactful communication in many situations, and few people want to give unnecessary verbal offense. In written communication, when we cannot be sure how our words will be read, it seems safer to use the occasional euphemism in the approach to “touchy” subjects. Many euphemisms are drawn from more formal English (e.g. dismissed for sacked ), and more formal vocabulary is part of the verbal repertoire of the professional writer. \n This is not to suggest making a habit of lofty expression. Writers who do are indulging not in euphemism but euphuism, the artificially elevated and embellished prose of John Lyly’s Euphues (an Elizabethan epistolary novel whose style was satirized by both Shakespeare and Walter Scott). The frontier between euphemism and public deception is also one to guard: George Orwell’s 1984 reminds us that with the corruption of language we risk the corruption of thought. \n Along with a sensitivity to euphemisms, writers should perhaps cultivate their sense of the opposite: dysphemisms – words and phrases which are likely to prove offensive to the reader. It helps to develop a scale from the most offensive, e.g. referring to someone as a cunt, up to the offhanded bloke which might only seem offensive in a formal context. Both dysphemisms and euphemisms are a resource for adjusting one’s expression to the needs of the situation. See also pejorative."

		"title": "ex silentio",
		"explanation":"Those who use an argumentum e(x) silentio (“argument from silence”) give themselves an enormous licence. They exploit the fact that an author or document is silent on the issue with which they are concerned, and use the absence of comment to bolster their own case. A silence or absence of comment can of course be interpreted in various ways – and in quite opposite ways, as the play A Man for All Seasons by Robert Bolt showed so well. The charges against Thomas More turned on arguing that his silence meant a denial of Henry VIII’s claims, while the standard aphorism was that silence meant consent: qui tacet consentire (“he who is silent [seems] to consent.”) Arguments based on silence or the lack of contrary evidence are not really arguments at all, but rhetoric which works on the principle of “heads I win, tails you lose.”"

		"title": "exalt or exult",
		"explanation":"With only a letter between them, and some similar connotations, these can be mistaken for each other. Both belong to an elevated style, and elevation is built into the meaning of both. But while exalt usually means “raise in status,” as in exalted position, exult (“rejoice, be jubilant”) has the spirits running high. The distinction is complicated by the fact that exalt is occasionally used to mean “give high praise to,” as in exalted them to the skies. Yet there’s a crucial grammatical difference, in that exalt either takes an object or is made a passive verb, whereas exult never takes an object and is never passive. \n When it comes to exaltation and exultation, there is little to choose between them. Both express high feelings. If we use exaltation for “elation,” and exultation for “triumphant joy,” there’s still a lot of common ground between them."

As often, the uninflected form is endorsed in the US: see further under inflectional extras."

		"title": "exception proves the rule",
		"explanation":"The thrust of this axiom is widely misunderstood, partly because the English version shortcircuits the Latin. In its full form it is a legal maxim: exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis, literally “the act of excepting confirms the rule for cases not excepted.” By that translation, it describes a reasonable process of argumentation: a principle can be established by selecting those cases to which it applies and setting aside others. (See further under induction.) \n But by translating exceptio into “exception,” the statement seems to make the paradoxical claim that an exception confirms the rule. This misunderstanding goes back centuries, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), since the use of exception to mean an exceptional example – rather than the act of excepting – is recorded from mid-C17 on, and is almost as old as the maxim itself."
	},
	{
		"title": "exceptional or exceptionable",
		"explanation":"The different values expressed in these words put a gulf between them. Exceptionable is always negatively charged, because it describes something people take exception to, as in: \n Residents whose behavior is exceptionable will be evicted from the hostel. \n Exceptional is an objective and definitive word, identifying something as an exception to the general rule, as in exceptional case. The exceptional student is outside the normal range, and in British (and Australian) English this is applied only at the top end of the scale, to mean “brilliant.” In American English it can be used at either end of the scale, and exceptional students may be brilliant or in need of remedial schooling. \n With a negative prefix (unexceptionable, unexceptional), the two words come closer in meaning. Both can mean “unremarkable” when applied to such things as programs or reports. Those which are unexceptionable will not raise objections, but they are as bland as those which are unexceptional and contain nothing out of the ordinary. Both words seem to damn with faint praise."

		"title": "exclamation points and exclamation marks",
		"explanation":"What Americans call the exclamation point is known by Canadians, Australians and the British as the exclamation mark. Either way, it has its most natural place in printed dialogue and reported speech, to show the dramatic or interactive force of a string of words. It occurs with greetings: \n Good evening! Hi! Happy New Year! \n with interjections: \n Hear, hear! Keep it up! \n with peremptory commands: \n Don’t do it! Get out of here! \n and with expressions of surprise, ranging from enthusiastic and sympathetic to the deprecatory: \n Absolutely superb! How lucky for you! What a shambles! \n As the examples show, exclamation points/marks are often used with fragments of sentences that work as exclamations. They do also occur with fully formed exclamatory sentences: \n  Don’t tell me! \n You walked all the way! \n Isn’t that amazing! \n As in the last example, exclamations may be phrased like questions, yet because no answer is being sought, they take an exclamation point/mark rather than a question mark. Note also that the exclamation point/mark takes the place of a full stop at the end of a sentence. \n 1 The extended role of exclamation points/marks. Apart from marking utterances which are truly exclamations, exclamation points/marks are used by some writers to draw the reader’s attention to a particular word, phrase or sentence which they find remarkable or ironic: \n The divorce settlement divided the contents of the house equally, so now she can give dinner parties for three! \n This use of exclamation points/marks has its place in interactive writing, for example in personal letters. But used this way in documentary writing, the effect is more dubious because of the diversity of readers’ responses and attitudes. They may not share the writer’s sense of irony, and so the reason for using the exclamation point/mark may be lost on them. Apart from the danger of inscrutability, exclamation points/marks lose their power to draw attention to anything if used too often. Even in informal writing they can be overdone, and those who write documentary prose must be very circumspect with them. \n 2 Exclamation points/marks and other punctuation. \n a) An exclamation point/mark which belongs to a quoted statement goes inside the final quotation marks: \n Her parting words were “It’s on!” \n b) The authorial exclamation point/mark which comments on a quoted statement goes outside the final quotation marks: \n After all that drama he said: “It’s not that important”! \n After all that drama he asked: “Who’d like a drink?”! \n c) An exclamation point/mark which belongs to a parenthesis goes inside the closing bracket (see brackets section 2). \n d) The exclamation point/mark precedes points of ellipsis: \n It’s on!... See you there. \n e) The use of double (!! ) or triple (!!! ) exclamation points/marks generally looks naive or hysterical."

		"title": "exclamations",
		"explanation":"The label exclamation has always been attached to a very mixed bag of utterances. Anything printed with an exclamation mark qualifies, ranging from: \n Hell! Damn it! Great! \n to more fully fledged utterances such as: \n The ideas you have! \n What a way to go! \n How sensitively he plays! \n Grammarians focus first and foremost on exclamations which begin with an interrogative word like how or what and contain the standard clause elements in the standard word order. (See further under clauses.) These are the only exclamations with a regular form, called exclamative in references such as the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) – a term which matches up with declarative, imperative and interrogative. But grammarians also acknowledge that exclamations may be formed exactly like statements, commands or questions: \n You tried it! \n Don’t do it! \n Isn’t she wonderful! \n These examples and the ones above show that the full range of exclamations cannot be identified by a particular grammatical form. They can be embodied in all types of sentences (declarative/ exclamative/imperative/interrogative), or in fragments of sentences and phrases. (See further under sentences.) We know them by their function in discourse – their exclamatory force in dialogue, and the similar force invested in whatever bears exclamation marks in writing."

		"title": "exhaustive or exhausting",

Exhaustive has more intellectual connections, and represents the judgement that the endeavor was thorough and complete. An exhaustive inquiry is one which works through (exhausts) all possibilities. Exhausting is more physical, and is concerned with the using up of material resources and human energy. So an exhausting day is one which leaves you devoid of energy. \n In some contexts either word could occur, and the writer’s choice depends on which perspective is sought. An exhaustive search for lost hikers implies a full ground and air search with all available resources; whereas exhausting search says that it was a grinding day for the rescue party. The first phrase is the detached comment of an administrator of emergency services, the second identifies with those who are actually doing the job."

Expiry is a brisker word, suggesting tight planning and tidy systems – though this may have something to do with its brevity, and the fact that it’s the word which confronts us every day, in the expiry date on credit cards, travel tickets and packaged foods. Expiration has the more detached qualities of a formal, latinate word. It seems to speak at a level above the gritty business of arranging contracts and observing their terms, and may indeed serve as something of a euphemism for expiry when the latter is an unwelcome fact. Apart from its legal use, expiration has some currency among biologists as a synonym for exhalation. Altogether, its usage is more academic and abstract than that of expiry."

Extraneous differs from both in implying that something neither belongs nor is intrinsic to the subject under discussion.

Thus extroduction matched introduction, and extroversion matched introversion. Very few writers, either British or American. now substitute extraversion (or extravert), judging by their rarity in both BNC and CCAE – and despite the Oxford Dictionary (1989), which has almost as many citations for extraversion/extravert as for extroversion/extrovert. \n ♦ Compare intra-/intro."

		"title": "-ey",

The main point to note with such words is that they form their plurals by adding s – unlike most nouns ending in y, whose plurals are with -ies (see -y>-i-). \n But -ey is also a variable spelling for -y in a number of English words. In some cases both the older forms with -ey (curtsey, doiley, fogey) and the younger ones with -y (curtsy, doily, fogy) have survived, with no differentiation of meaning. In other cases the two spellings have developed different meanings, at least in some varieties of English. See for example the entries for bog(e)y, stor(e)y and whisk(e)y. The two different spellings mean that there are also two plural forms for each. \n Spellings with -ey are transitional for a number of colloquial adjectives, such as chanc(e)y, mous(e)y, phon(e)y, pric(e)y: see further under -y/-ey. \n ♦ For the choice between Surrey and Surry, see under that heading."

The archetype, recorded in Boston in 1840, was Eyetalian, while variants of it – Eyetie, Eytie, Eytye, Eyety, Eyto – have been recorded in both American and British English since the 1920s. Webster’s Third (1986) notes that they may appear from time to time without an initial capital. Alternative spellings of Itie (Iti, Ity) are also known in British English according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), though they are not registered in Webster’s. \n As spellings, these are less than effective, since the first set with Eye- present a distracting folk etymology, and the second set with just I- leave the pronunciation in doubt. But we need hardly lament if they miss their target, when their prime purpose is to express ethnic prejudice. The neutral Italian, with its straightforward geographical and historical associations, provides better and fairer identification. See further under racist language."

The original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) gave preference to aerie; but eyrie is now the dominant spelling in Britain, according to the second edition (1989), and BNC data confirms this. In American English aerie is still preferred, according to Webster’s Third (1986), which correlates with its large majority in data from CCAE. \n The spelling aerie connects the word with its French origins, in aire (“a threshing floor” or “high level stretch of ground”). However words of that kind were variously spelled ayre and eyre in early modern English, and use of the second variant was reinforced by the English dialect word eyre(n) (“egg(s)”), which suggested a folk etymology for the word, as a place for eggs. \n ♦ Compare eerie or eery."

		"title": "f/ph",
		"explanation":"The use of f or ph is fixed in most English words, reflecting their origins. The ph is used in words borrowed from Greek, such as: \n phallic phenomenon philosophy \n phlegm phosphorus physics \n It also occurs in modern words formed with Greek elements, such as -phil/-philia, -phobia, phono-/-phony, -graph/-graphy etc. Words from any other source (Latin, French, Italian or Anglo-Saxon) are spelled with f: \n fashion federal fiasco flight \n foreign frame fuse \n As the examples show, words with the ph spelling are usually scholarly terms, while those with f are common usage. \n For just a handful of words, the spelling may be either ph or f. In the case of sulfur/sulphur, it depends on whether the use is scientific or not (see sulfur). For others such as calif/caliph and serif/seriph, the f is closer to the original word (in Arabic and Dutch respectively), and the ph lends them a spurious Greekness. Spellings with f prevail for fantasy/phantasy and griffin/gryphon because they came via Middle French, though they do have Greek antecedents. \n F/ph variation also shows up when we refer to the Filipino people of the Philippines. The islands are named after Philip II of Spain, and the spelling remains in line with the Greek (and English) way of writing his name. The name for the people comes via Spanish, where words with ph have all been respelled with f. See for example: fısica ´ (“physics”), filosofo ´ (“philosopher”), fotografıa´ (“photography”). The same replacement of ph has occurred in Italian, and in a number of Scandinavian and Slavic languages. But English usually preserves the ph in Greek loanwords, and the ph grapheme falls in with the set of others compounded with h: ch, gh, sh, wh."

Database evidence from both the US and the UK shows that the regular plurals prevail now for dwarf, roof turf; whereas hoof, scarf, wharf still tend to have hooves, scarves, wharves as their plurals. Hoofs, scarfs, wharfs nevertheless make up a substantial minority in the US. The relativities can be seen in the following percentages, based on data from CCAE and the BNC: \n dwarfs (dwarves) CCAE:96% (4%)  BNC:83% (17%) \n  hoofs (hooves) CCAE:34% (66%) BNC:18% (82%) \n roofs (rooves) CCAE:100% BNC:99% (1%) \n scarfs (scarves) CCAE:24% (76%) BNC:3% (97%) \n turfs (turves) CCAE:100% BNC:55% (45%) \n wharfs (wharves) CCAE:24% (76%) BNC:17% (83%) \n  Handkerchief (mostly found in the UK) is usually pluralized as handkerchiefs rather than handkerchieves. \n Many other nouns ending in f, ff or ffe have always formed their plurals with s: \n carafes chefs chiefs cliffs cuffs \n giraffes griefs gulfs muffs proofs \n  puffs reefs ruffs skiffs strifes \n  surfs waifs \n All are relatively recent, i.e. post-medieval additions to English. The plurals of staff and tipstaff are discussed under staff, stave and staffer.

		"title": "facility or faculty",
		"explanation":"From a common origin in Latin, these two have developed quite distinct areas of meaning in modern English. Facility refers to the ease with which we perform any acquired skill, from opening wine bottles to speaking Spanish. A faculty is one of the set of innate powers of perception attributed to people in general. By tradition the five faculties are sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, though the faculty of reason adds a sixth. Younger people take all their faculties for granted; elderly people cannot, hence the phrase in full possession of his/her faculties. \n Both facility and faculty are used of resources beyond those of the individual, but again their applications diverge. Facilities has come to mean “physical and organizational resources,” whether for arranging conferences or making coffee in your motel room. The term faculty is used collectively in Britain, Canada and Australia to mean a department or set of academic disciplines, such as Arts, Science or Law. In American English, faculty refers to the whole teaching staff of a university, college or school, distinguishing it thus from administrative and general staff (who are called “staff ”). Faculty can be construed as a singular or plural entity, witness: \n Our faculty is one of the best in America. \n The faculty is willing to support the idea. \n Some faculty were cautious. \n Faculty have been getting late salary checks. \n As the examples show, the plural is probably helped by contexts that project faculty members as individuals. Overall the singular construction is commoner by far in CCAE, in keeping with the more general American preference for formal agreement (see agreement section 1). Yet some database examples with the singular read so awkwardly as to suggest the intervention of editors too committed to maintaining a grammatical tenet: Over half the faculty is women, The faculty is there as experts to dispense wisdom. In such cases the plural “are” (i.e. notional/proximity agreement, rather than formal agreement) would have been more congruent with the sense presented by the author. The use of plural agreement has increased in American English since the 1950s, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), and is widely accepted among academics. Such usage has long been established in British English."

		"title": "facsimile and fax",
		"explanation":"In Latin fac simile is a command to “make an exact copy,” but its use in English reflects changing technology. In C17 English fac-simile was used as a noun for a handwritten copy of a document, especially for legal purposes. Printed facsimiles of early manuscripts were first produced in C19, as a resource for scholarship, like the facsimile edition of Pushkin’s notebooks. Facsimiles are of course produced in other mediums in the name of art and architecture, as well as politics, witness the giant facsimile of a $10,000 contribution check, used at party rallies to solicit support in an American election. But applications of facsimile to something other than words make up only a small proportion of current usage, a minor counterpoint to its everyday use for an electronically produced copy of a document. The technology of the office facsimile machine in fact goes back to the less reliable facsimile telegraphy and facsimile radio of late C19. \n In its current applications, facsimile is normally replaced by the abbreviation fax, especially in combinations like fax machine and send a fax, but also when it appears as an independent noun and verb: thank you for your fax; fax me the details. The presentation of fax numbers alongside phone numbers has no doubt helped to spread the word. Its regular use in business communications and in a variety of other contexts means it can scarcely be considered informal, in either British or American English. Rather it has made facsimile the formal word. Among data from both BNC and CCAE fax outnumbers facsimile by more than 7:1. This includes instances of fax used as a verb (around 10% of the total), which have helped to establish it. \n ♦ Compare memorandum and memo."

Both factious and fractious imply uncooperative behavior, and both once meant “tending to split up into petty divisions” (factious because it derives from faction, and fractious from fraction). Nowadays only factious carries that meaning, while fractious refers to the character of an individual who may be anything from unruly and violent to irritable, but at any rate difficult for others to handle: \n He was a fractious citizen at council meetings. \n  The baby was getting tired and fractious with waiting. \n Factitious means “contrived or artificial.” It may be applied to human behavior, as in factitious charm; or to things without the value they might appear to have, as in factitious shares.

		"explanation":"In North America faggot (or alternatively fagot) can be used harmlessly in reference to material objects: a bundle of sticks, or iron rods, or an embroidery pattern. The British share these uses of faggot, and they also apply it to a type of meatball made of pork liver. In Britain, fag also has harmless uses in referring to a cigarette and a tiresome task, hence the phrases the fag end (of the day) and fagged out (“tired out”). Being colloquial, they may raise questions of stylistic suitability, but that is all. \n When applied to persons, faggot and fag have always been derogatory and are now a liability. The first has been used for centuries as an unflattering reference to a woman, as in silly old faggot – not a model of inclusive language (see further under that heading). And the time-honored practice of British boarding schools of making every new boy a fag (or slave) to one more senior has had fateful consequences for some: \n At Eton he had been fag to a charmless older boy who had wasted no time in introducing him to homosexuality. \n That example from the BNC lends force to the largest current problem with these words, given their use in C20 American English to refer to a male homosexual, as in fag-bashing and Manhattan faggot. An American politician can pledge such strong curbs on financial institutions as to make Attila the Hun look like a faggot. As those examples suggest, the words faggot and fag carry an emotional charge, which can turn to victimization. The BNC confirms that the homosexual sense of both fag and faggot is now known in Britain: people called me a fag for being an actor; I doublebacked through the faggot district. This usage clearly tangles with existing British uses of these words, apart from adding to the unlovely inventory of sexist language (see further under sexism in language).

		"title": "fair or fairly",
		"explanation":"Both of these have a role as adverbs meaning “honestly” or “without resorting to underhand means,” though fair is increasingly restricted to a few fixed collocations, such as play fair and fight fair. Others such as bid fair, promise fair, speak fair, write fair (where fair means “well”) are becoming distinctly old-fashioned. Where it survives in ordinary conversation, fair still has a role as an intensifier of other words, as in: \n It hit me fair and square on the nose. \n It fair gets me down. \n (See further under intensifiers.) \n In more formal discourse the adverb is fairly, and it still means “honestly” or “justly.” See for example: campaigned fairly, umpired fairly, divided it fairly. Yet by far the commonest use of fairly, by more than 10:1 according to the BNC, is as a modifier of other verbs, adverbs or especially adjectives, as in: \n . . . it’s fairly knocked about \n . . . she covered the ground fairly easily \n . . . a fairly common occurrence \n Most of the time fairly serves as a downtoner (see further under hedge words). This is standard usage, found in many kinds of writing. More colloquial is its occasional use as an intensifier, as in It fairly hissed through the broken window."

		"title": "fallacies",
		"explanation":"These are flawed arguments. Speakers and writers get away with them more often than they should, probably because they come in many guises. Some types of fallacy have traditional Latin names, others have English ones. The labels do help to distinguish them, so for those who would like to be able to detect fallacies in their own argument, or anyone else’s, here is an inventory of the major types. \n  Fallacies in the use of words and their representation of reality \n a) false analogy (see under analogy) \n b) reification: when an abstract word is used as if it referred to a concrete entity. It happens when a theory or principle is expressed as if it were a fact or element of the real world, as when a sociologist says “society forces us to . . . ” \n c) faulty generalization: when a sweeping generalization is drawn from a small and not necessarily representative set of examples: “The trains are always ten minutes late.” \n d) faulty classification: when the terms offered to cover a range of possibilities are insufficient to cover it. Tick-the-box questionnaires often oblige us to use very rough classifications – to show whether we do something always/often/ sometimes/never, but there’s nowhere to register the fact that we do it rarely but regularly. In its crudest form, the faulty classification may be a false dichotomy and offer us only two alternatives: true/false, yes/no, good/bad. Other familiar forms of false dichotomy are the “black or white argument,” and the idea that “whoever is not with us is against us.” \n 2 Logical fallacies \n a) faulty deduction: when the argument rests on affirming the consequent, or denying the antecedent. (See under deduction for their proper logical counterparts.) \n b) using the undistributed middle. This is a flawed syllogism, where the middle term is not made universal through the use of all. If it only relates to some of the population in the major premise, no proper conclusion can be drawn. (See further under deduction.) \n c) circular argument, sometimes called the vicious circle, is one which claims as its conclusion the very assumption on which it began. It happens in some essays and theses, when writers divide their material (say newspaper articles) into four categories, discuss each one in turn, and then declare “we may conclude that there are four major types of news report.” Similarly flawed arguments are those which beg the question, also known by the Latin phrase petitio principii. (See further under beg the question.) \n d) analytic–synthetic confusion, sometimes known as the “no true Scotsman” fallacy. Here an assertion is made which can be tested by empirical evidence, as with “This publication can be obtained at all good bookshops.” If the statement is challenged by someone who was unable to get the book at what most people think of as a good bookshop, the defender shifts ground to the terms of the assertion itself, and claims that the bookshop visited could not be a good one. So what appears to be a synthetic statement is defended as an analytic one. (See further under induction.) \n e) non sequitur arguments suffer from a logical gap between the premise and the conclusion. (See under non sequitur.) \n f ) post hoc propter hoc arguments make the mistake of assuming that what comes after is a result or effect of whatever went before. (See under post hoc.) \n f) irrelevant conclusion, also known by the Latin phrase ignoratio elenchi (“ignoring of [the required] disproof ”). Here the person arguing devotes great effort to proving or disproving something which is beside the point at issue. \n 3 Diversionary arguments i.e. those which rely on diverting attention from the issues or sidestepping them: \n a) forestalling disagreement, as when an argument is led by the statement: “No intelligent person would think that X is Y,” or “The only proper response is Y” \n b) argumentum ad hominem. This is an argument which makes either a personal attack, or a special appeal to the other party in the debate. (See further under ad hominem.) \n  c) damning the origin: the technique of quashing an argument by discrediting its source or authority, and highlighting anything about them that can be made out to be reprehensible or ridiculous. It dodges the argument itself. \n d) straw man argument. This works by attributing an exaggerated or extreme position to the other party, and attacking it as a way of undermining their credibility. It is often used in political debate. \n ♦ For further discussion of types of argument, see argument."

To an English-speaker it’s a surprise to find that in French the verb assister, when used with examen (“exam”), means to “sit for the exam” not to act as a supervisor for it. Many of the false friends among European languages involve words originating in Latin, which each language uses in its own way. But false friends are also to be found among words borrowed from European into Asian languages, where they can take on new meanings, as when siribu (“silver”) becomes the Japanese word for “grey power.” \n Among the varieties of English used around the world, false friends also show up.

The fruit which we know as the currant got its name this way (see currant), as did the pea, the cherry and sherry.

It could be associated with either death or destiny until the English formation fateful made its appearance in C18. Both meanings are blended in the ominous “fatal shore,” a convict’s reference to Australia in the Ballad of Van Diemen’s Land, recorded around 1825. Overall fatal remains much more common."

Literally (and in reverse order) it means “to go worst,” but it identifies the last resort – what one must be prepared for in the worst of all possible worlds.

Fay is an old-fashioned word for “fairy,” and fey an adjective which originated as a synonym of “doomed.” Fey connoted a weird state of excitement and heightened awareness in someone whose death was imminent; and so it has come to mean “under a spell,” “lightheaded,” and “given to elfish whimsy or eccentricity.” In this way fey begins to overlap with the adjectival use of fay, particularly when used to describe certain kinds of imaginative writing. Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream could thus be regarded as either a fay tale or a fey tale. And what of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Iolanthe? Its unlikely fairies suggest that it’s more a fey tale – but the choice is ultimately up to the critic. \n Note that the word fey is apt to be misinterpreted as connoting “gay” in phrases such as a slightly fey young man – even though the speaker/writer is most probably referring to his mental rather than sexual orientation."

		"title": "federal or Federal",
		"explanation":"The question for writers and editors is whether to capitalize this word when referring to national governments and institutions. American style, according to the Chicago Manual (2003), is to use federal in generic combinations such as federal government/agency/court/powers, in keeping with its generally thrifty use of capital letters (see capital letters sections 1d and 3). The capitalized Federal is of course required in official titles such as the US Federal Reserve. Otherwise federal prevails, as in the federal Endangered Species Act or federal Bureau of Reclamation, where the lower case form helps to show that the phrase is not the official name. \n Elsewhere the situation is similar. Canadians refer to the Federal Court of Canada as such, but write federal government department names when they are paraphrases (Editing Canadian English, 2000). The Australian government Style Manual (2002) has it that the word needs a capital letter in official nomenclature, e.g. Federal Constitution, Federal Parliament. Lower case appears in all nonofficial designations and references, such as the federal department of health, federal–state relations, the federal executive of the Labor party. \n Applications of the word elsewhere in the world have to be decided on their merits. Though Federal Republic was the established English translation for the former West Germany, there’s no capital letter when alluding to the German federal chancellor or to federal elections there. Agencies of central government in South America are likewise referred to in lower case – federal child welfare agency, federal police headquarters – where the phrase only approximates local nomenclature. \n American historical writers sometimes use Federal as an alternative to Federalist when referring to the northern/Union side in the American Civil War. Both words contrast with the use of Confederacy for the southern opposition: see under confederation."

This doesn’t prevent it being used with lower case in references to notional or nonconstituted bodies, such as a federation of recreation industry unions or a Protestant federation across the world. \n For Australians the word Federation has particular national significance, and is associated with the year 1901 at which the six former colonies became the unified Commonwealth. The capital letter therefore correlates with its status as a historical event (see capital letters section 1f)."

Felspar represents a mistaken etymology by which the first element was understood as the German Fels (“rock”). Though “corrupt,” it was at one time the commoner spelling according to the Oxford.

		"title": "female, feminine, feminist or feminazi",
		"explanation":"These words become controversial in what they express – or seem to express – about a woman’s identity. \n Female is used as adjective or noun to identify natural gender, as in a female acrobat and the fieldworker was a female. It contrasts with male, in referring to human, animal and plant species, though the two words look alike only because of C14 folk etymology, which respelled the French antecedent femelle with -male as the second syllable. The use of female as a noun became contentious in later C19, because it was thought to degrade women to the level of animals. Meanwhile its use in the jargon of metal trades, where the female part (i.e. a socket or bolt) is the one into which another is inserted or screwed, seems not to have occasioned any comment. The BNC provides evidence of now widespread use of female as a noun in reference to women, in many analytical contexts where the population is divided equally [or otherwise] between males and females. The noun female is standard in policespeak, as in accused of killing a white female. There and elsewhere it avoids reference to and prejudgement about women’s age, giving it positive value where nondiscriminatory language is sought. \n Feminine has long connoted the social and behavioral attributes of women that were deemed archetypal of their sex, including delicacy, prettiness, refinement of taste and feeling, as well as weakness. The genteel virtues of the word recommend it to those who would emphasize “la diff ´erence” and find it courteous and respectful of women. But those who know or see disadvantage in gender difference are less positive about the word and its connotations. The other familiar use of feminine – its application to grammatical gender – is of course neutral and strictly sexless (see gender section 1). \n Feminist seems very much a contemporary word, though first recorded as adjective and noun in the 1890s. It was and is applied to whoever or whatever advocates equal rights and opportunities for women. In recent usage it connotes also the female-oriented critique of society, history or literature, as in the feminist literary canon. Feminist attitudes are diametrically opposed to those of male chauvinists. (See further under chauvinism.) Some women (and men) would regard the words feminist and feminine as mutually exclusive, but the assumption is not shared by all. None are likely to identify with the feminazi, the totally negative word used occasionally by those wishing to discredit the feminist position, whether reasonable or not."

All such elements draw attention to natural gender or sex (see gender section 2), and are therefore increasingly avoided by those aiming for nonsexist language. \n In English prosody, feminine endings or feminine rhymes consist of the two last syllables of a line, with a final unstressed vowel and the stressed one before it, as in the opening couplet of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales (c. 1380): \n Whan that April, with his shoures sote. \n  The droght of March hath perced to the rote . . . \n They contrast with the much more familiar masculine endings of Chaucer’s next couplet, where the last stressed syllable alone makes the rhyme: \n And bathed every vein in swich licour. \n Of which vertu engendred is the flour. \n Masculine endings now dominate the rhyming patterns of English poetry."

		"explanation":"Expressions like fomenting trouble are the most usual collocation for foment meaning “foster,” “instigate.” It always takes as object a word referring to civil disturbance, such as discord, revolution, riots, strikes, violence, unrest. This is nowadays almost the only remaining use for a verb which once had a place in medical practice (there foment meant “warm” or “apply a warm poultice [or other substance] to.” Shrinking usage of foment, coupled with the fact that in standard southern British pronunciation it sounds much like ferment, help to explain how the two can be interchanged,as in \n . . . politicians and warlords who are fermenting this chaos \n . . . the sole intention of fermenting a campaign aimed at causing damage \n Examples like these from the BNC show the figurative use of ferment, where the latent imagery of brewing works as well as that of putting heat into something. British and American dictionaries all acknowledge this use of ferment, alongside its main application to the biological process of fermentation. The figurative use is probably helped by the existence of the noun ferment and the phrase in a ferment meaning “in a state of agitation.” There is no comparable noun for foment. All this helps to explain why ferment is putting pressure on foment in expressions like fermenting/fomenting trouble, and likely to bubble up on top."

Particular expressions may be subjected to intense attention, and revered or held up as models of correctness for the rest of the community to observe – such as not splitting infinitives or ending sentences with prepositions (see split infinitive and particles). The observation of such things becomes the canon of “correctness” for all, irrespective of time and place. Fetishes of usage put an arbitrary stamp of “correct” on one expression rather than another, often out of conservatism and sometimes ignorance. Though no longer the focus of English language education, language fetishes are still sometimes invoked to pick holes in other people’s expression, often as a means of discrediting what they say.

		"title": "fetus or foetus, and fetal or foetal",
		"explanation":"No-one doubts that fetus is the standard spelling in American English, and it appears in 99% of all instances of the word in CCAE. But it may come as a surprise that fetus is foregrounded in the New Oxford (1998), at least as the “technical” spelling. Recent discussions in the British Lancet magazine have reinforced the use of fetus in British medical and biomedical contexts, and it’s comfortably represented in 35% of the word’s appearances in the BNC, drawn from 30 different sources. The Canadian preference for fetus is clear in the Canadian Oxford (1998), whereas Australians still work with foetus, according to the Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n In fact foetus has centuries of tradition behind it. The spelling seems to have originated through misunderstanding – that the word derived from the Latin verb foetare (“give birth”) rather than the verb fere (“conceive”), of which it’s the past participle. Foetus passed from medieval Latin into Middle English, and has maintained its place in British English, appearing in 65% of instances and almost 4 times as many BNC sources as does fetus. It is probably preferred by those who think of it as a simple case of British/American divergence over the use of the oe digraph (see further at oe). The same applies generally to the use of foetal or fetal, in f(o)etal position etc. In BNC data, foetal appears in almost twice the number of sources – though it makes up only a minority (24%) of all instances of the word. \n With this duality of usage, writers outside the US (and UK medical circles) have some freedom of choice. They too might prefer fetus/fetal, either in terms of etymology or the general principle of reducing oe digraphs to e – or both. Clearly it isn’t a simple British/American divide. \n The plural of f(o)etus is f(o)etuses, as for most other loanwords from the Latin fourth declension.

		"title": "few or a few, and several",
		"explanation":"All are indefinite pronouns and determiners used of a relatively small number, yet there are important differences. Compare: \n They wrote few letters \n with \n  They wrote a few letters \n The first sentence implies that the number was lower than expected, whereas the second simply notes the small number without any evaluation. In fact it gives no very precise idea as to how many were written: it’s simply a casual alternative for “some.” The quantity implied by a few is always relative to the population referred to. A few letters in the mailbox might be half a dozen, whereas a few spectators at the match might amount to fifty. Still one should never put too fine a point on it, because the very reason for using a few is that it means a vaguely small number. Note that despite the presence of a, it always takes plural agreement, as in: A few buds were beginning to show. \n greement, as in: A few buds were beginning to show. Several is like a few in being non-exact, while differing in its limited numerical range. Dictionaries generally define it as “more than two (or three) but not many.” Some (e.g. Collins, 1991) suggest that several means “more than a few” – suggesting a kind of scale between them. The Longman Grammar (1999) points rather to a stylistic contrast, based on the fact that several occurs twice as often as a few in academic texts, and much less in conversation. Despite its non-exactness, several seems to be free of the casual and colloquial overtones of a few."

		"title": "fewer or less",
		"explanation":"These two present themselves as a stylistic choice in one relatively uncommon construction. Compare: \n . . . farmers with less financial resources \n  . . . farmers with fewer financial resources \n According to prescriptivists, the first construction is wrong because fewer must be used with count nouns (e.g. “resources”), and less only with collective or mass nouns, e.g. farmers with less money. (See further under count and mass nouns). But the prescriptive rule requires us to make a distinction on one side of the comparative paradigm where there is none on the other. We use more with both count and mass nouns: farmers with more financial resources / farmers with more money. In fact the pressure to use fewer with countables is relatively recent. It surfaces first as the stylistic preference of Baker (1770) for fewer as the pronoun in no fewer than a hundred, and has since then stiffened into a broader grammatical requirement for the determiner (shown in the examples above) – wherever prescriptivists prevail. Meanwhile the use of less as the determiner with count nouns goes back a thousand years, by the Oxford Dictionary (1989) record. \n Apart from its role as determiner/pronoun, less is also commonly used as adverb. This is rarely brought into the discussion, but it explains why less is sometimes hyphenated with a following adjective in American texts, as in less-promising results. It ensures that less is read as an adverb qualifying “promising,” rather than a determiner indicating a smaller number of “(promising) results.” The second meaning can be reliably communicated using fewer (fewer promising results). But since neither less nor fewer is quantitively precise, the difference is rather unimportant. This tallies with the fact that speakers are less inclined than writers to use fewer as the determiner/pronoun with count nouns, by the evidence of databases. In BNC spoken data the ratio of fewer to less is half that of the written data; and in CCAE the uses of less with countables are typically in quoted speech: “the less guns you have out there, the less gun-related injuries.” \n In the written medium, the practice of using fewer rather than less with countables is more visible – although the Oxford Dictionary notes the frequent use of less with countables in spite of it being “regarded as incorrect.” Webster’s Third (1986) gives “fewer” as one of the definitions of less; while the Random House Dictionary (1987) comments that less is increasingly found with count nouns in all varieties of English, and that fewer is becoming a mark of formal style. Data from the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus show that fewer is rare by comparison with less as a determiner, in academic discourse or any other kind. \n Exceptions to the imposition of fewer are also now recognized, in constructions where less is a pronoun, and especially when followed by than. \n See for example: \n Express lane: fifteen items or less. \n I live less than four hours drive from the wildfowl marsh. \n He smashed his racquet on the ground on no less than eight occasions. \n Lager accounted for less than 10 per cent of total beer sales. \n Usage commentators usually note that less occurs in expressions involving quantities of money, time, distance, weight etc., where the quantity mentioned may seem to become a kind of collective entity. The acceptance of less in this role is reflected in data from both BNC and CCAE, where constructions with less than outnumber those with fewer than by more than 7:1. Still the shibboleth against less shows itself in some odd uses of fewer in the BNC, which smack of arbitrary intervention: \n Fewer than a fifth of the schools kept records . . . \n An exchange rate of fewer than DM3 to the pound today . . . \n Opera attracted fewer than 1 per cent (of the population). \n Less than would read more naturally in all of them, and would create no ambiguity. \n The pressure to substitute fewer for less seems to have developed out of all proportion to the ambiguity it may create in noun phrases like less promising results. That aside, it was and is essentially a stylistic choice, between the more formal fewer and the more spontaneous less. Fewer draws attention to itself, whereas less shifts the focus on to its more significant neighbors."

		"title": "fiasco",
		"explanation":"Literally this is Italian for “a bottle/flask,” but in C19 theatrical idiom far fiasco meant “be a disaster,” hence the meaning “complete failure” attached to fiasco as a loanword in English. The image underlying the idiom is uncertain, perhaps that of breaking a bottle, helped by the sound of the word itself (see onomatopoeia). But what should the plural be in English? The form fiascos is implicit in the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) lack of comment, and it’s the only plural used by British writers in the BNC. However Webster’s Third (1986) gives fiascoes priority over fiascos, and this accords with its 2:1 ratio in American data from CCAE. It diverges from the usual American preference for the more regular inflection, and from the findings of the Langscape survey (1998–2001), where Americans overwhelmingly preferred fiascos – while a proportion of British respondents (24%) were more inclined to use fiascoes. Clearly there’s room to choose, but no place for “fiasci.” See further under -o."

		"title": "fictional or fictitious",
		"explanation":"The presence of fiction in fictional reminds us that the creative imagination is at work, as when we speak of a fictional mid-Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash, or of recreating the fictional journey of Phileas Fogg in Around the World in Eighty Days. Fictional creations like these stand in their own right and the fact that they never existed is not an issue or matter of concern. \n Fictitious highlights the nonfactuality of whatever it qualifies. The fictitious Caribbean island is no part of the known world, and there’s no substance to fictitious assets such as gold mines. The spy who double-crosses supplies a steady stream of fictitious information garnished with sufficient truth to give it credibility. Yet, as in that example, the boundaries between reality and imagination are often fluid. A TV docudrama may create a fictitious division of the British constabulary, and a magazine can flourish on the strength of the fictitious letters of Mr Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend. Jane Austen’s fictional Emma is also the kind of fictitious Englishwoman who always refers to herself as “one,” according to one BNC example. \n ♦ For the distinction between fictitious and factitious, see under factious."

		"title": "figures of speech",
		"explanation":"In everyday English the phrase figure of speech is used to discount a metaphor or hyperbole: “It’s only a figure of speech,” people say, when a newspaper editor speaks of “politicians brainwashing the public.” The taste or appetite for figures of speech has declined, and their range is not as well known as when rhetoric loomed large in the educational curriculum. Yet they remain powerful communicative devices when used occasionally. \n Figures of speech include any unusual way of using words to refer to something, especially those which stimulate the imagination. They work by establishing a likeness between two unlike things – either explicitly, in a simile: “My love is like a red, red rose”; or implicitly, through metaphors which develop sustained imagery or analogies (see metaphors). \n Personification (of abstract concepts) and anthropomorphism (of animals) are special kinds of metaphor (see under personification). Metonymy and synecdoche differ from metaphor in two ways: they are not usually sustained, and the verbal substitute is closely related to the item it replaces (see further under metonymy and synecdoche). \n Any figure of speech may also gain its effect through exaggeration (hyperbole) or through understatement (meiosis). The latter term is often replaced by litotes, though litotes is more strictly a form of understatement in which you assert something by negative means, as in “He doesn’t hate us.” The intention is to impress by the moderation of the statement. \n Some figures of speech work through the arrangements and patterns of words themselves. Parallelism involves the repetition of a particular phrase or clause structure with different words slotted in, as in “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.” The chiasmus exploits the same words or related ones in a symmetrically opposed arrangement (see under chiasmus). In an oxymoron, words with opposite meaning are juxtaposed in the same phrase (see oxymoron). The sound elements of words are exploited through figures of speech such as alliteration, assonance and onomatopoeia (see further under those headings). \n Like any kind of ornament, figures of speech work best when integrated with the meaning and purpose of the discourse. The overuse of any kind of metaphor can result in a ludicrous mix, and an overdose of litotes or alliteration quickly becomes irritating. In scattered headlines or advertising slogans they may be indulged, but in continuous prose they must be used sparingly for optimal effect."

		"title": "fillet or filet",
		"explanation":"Both these go back to Old French filet meaning “thread,” and filet is the only way to spell the squarish kind of lace or net, according to dictionaries everywhere. But American dictionaries show that filet also varies with fillet in the US for referring to a thin strip of material – whether as a hairband, or an architectural fill-in between moldings or the flutes of a column, or other technical uses – and especially in reference to boneless fish or meat, as in a tender filet of beef. This last is no doubt influenced by modern French gastronomic terms such as filet mignon. In data from CCAE filet is used as often as fillet in English references to cuts of meat or fish: the filet of fresh cod / flaky, white-fleshed snapper or the less attractive fish filet that’s been sitting under the warming light since Memorial Day. The British meanwhile use fillet for their everyday beef steak, or fillet of fish, and reserve filet for the filet de boeuf on the restaurant menu. Australians use fillet and filet in distinct ways like the British (Macquarie Dictionary, 1997), whereas Canadians have the American variation (Canadian Oxford, 1998). \n ♦ For the spelling of fil(l)et when it becomes a verb, see under -t."

		"title": "fin de siècle",
		"explanation":"This French phrase, meaning “end of the century,” featured in the title of a novel by F. de Jouvenot and H. Micard (1888). It passed very quickly from being an adjective with the meaning “modern” and “avant garde,” to meaning “decadent.” The first meaning was there in the Melbourne Punch of 1891, in this fin de siecle ballet ` . But by 1908 fin de siecle ` had become retrospective in meaning and associated with “fading glory.” \n At the turn of C21, its use is mostly historical. All dictionaries present the phrase with its grave accent, though the accentless form would never be mistaken. Hyphens are added to it (fin-de-siecle ` ) in Webster’s Third (1986), presumably because it’s usually a compound adjective.

		"title": "fingers and thumbs",
		"explanation":"Our ability to write – to put pen to paper – is a remarkable fruit of both evolution and our sociocultural history. Both the opposed thumb (which we share with the other primates), and the use of a highly developed written code (which is ours alone), come together as we write. But English is still at sixes and sevens over how to refer to the digits of the hand. Some of the time we speak of having five fingers, and talking of a middle finger presupposes this too. The traditional marriage service spoke of placing a ring on the fourth finger. And nowadays piano music always identifies the fingers to be used by numbers 1 to 5 (the “Continental” system) – reversing an earlier system (the “English” system) by which the thumb was shown with an x, and the fingers as 1 to 4. The etymology of the word finger is believed to be related to the number 5. \n Yet those who refer to the first finger usually mean “the index finger” rather than the thumb; and the question as to which finger bears the wedding ring is usually sidestepped by calling it the ring finger. In older tradition it was called “the medicinal finger,” because of a superstition that potions should be stirred with it to test for their noxiousness. (The practice linked up with the notion that a nerve ran direct from that finger to the heart – which also explains the choice of finger for the wedding ring.) Contemporary medics and nurses avoid all possible ambiguity by referring to each finger by individual names: thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, little finger."

		"title": "finished with",
		"explanation":"A curiosity of this idiom meaning “be done with” is the fact that with agent subjects (personal pronouns or names), it can be construed either with the auxiliary be or have. Either way it remains active in sense: \n When they have finished with you . . . \n She was finished with planning, with striving. \n Both are current in British English, though the construction with have is more common than the one with be, by more than 2:1 in both spoken and written data from the BNC. This lends no support to the notion that the be construction is more common in speech. In their often contracted forms (the two I’ve finished with; the ones you’re finished with) the ratio between the two auxiliaries remains much the same. But in American English, the be construction is much more frequent overall, lending support to the notion that there is some regional difference about it. The British preference for the have construction coincides with higher use of the perfect tenses overall. See further under have."

		"title": "finite verbs",
		"explanation":"Every fully fledged clause has a finite verb. They are the forms of verbs which have a definite tense (either present or past) and mood (indicative or imperative). In the following sentences, all the verbs are finite: \n They give a good performance (present, indicative) \n She gave a good performance (past, indicative) \n Give a good performance (present, imperative) \n Finite verbs can be either single words as in those sentences, or the first element of a compound verb phrase, as in the following: \n He was giving a good deal. \n He would have given a good deal. \n He ought to give a good deal. \n In compound verbs, the tense and mood are carried by the auxiliary verb(s); and the various parts of the main verb giving, given, (to) give are all nonfinite. On their own, the nonfinite elements are insufficient to make clauses, and can only be the basis of a phrase: \n Given encouragement . . . \n Giving no thought for others . . . \n To give them a chance . . . \n Note that the nonfinite give (often called the infinitive) is identical with several finite parts of the verb, as shown above in the imperative, and the present indicative with they. It would be the same for I, we and you. In those cases, the finiteness is only evident in the fact that there is a subject directly governing the verb, expressed either as a pronoun or a noun phrase, or else left implicit in the imperative mood. \n For many verbs, the past tense (finite) and the past nonfinite form (participle) are identical: \n They supplied the goods quickly. \n They have supplied the goods quickly. \n Once again, the finiteness or nonfiniteness can only be seen by referring to the accompanying words. The subject they makes supplied finite in the first sentence, and the auxiliary have makes it nonfinite in the second. \n An alternative term for the traditional finite verb is tensed verb, used in the Introduction to the Grammar of English (1984). See further under auxiliary verbs, infinitives, nonfinite clause, participles and phrases."

		"title": "first or firstly",
		"explanation":"An old and peculiar tradition of style has it that when enumerating items, you should use first (not firstly), followed by secondly, thirdly, fourthly etc. The origins of this are rather obscure. The odd sequence is enshrined in the English Prayer Book’s marriage service, which may have lent authority to it. This, coupled with the absence of firstly from Dr. Johnson’s dictionary, might account for the C19 notion that there was something wrong with it. By 1847 De Quincey calls firstly “a ridiculous and most pedantic neologism.” But it was no neologism according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), being first recorded in C16 and from time to time after that. De Quincey’s view was in fact countered by a contemporary who observed firstly being used by a number of authors, “for the sake of its more accordant sound with secondly, thirdly.” Most usage commentators from Fowler (1926) on agree that firstly is perfectly logical as the preliminary to secondly, thirdly.

		"title": "first name, forename or given name",
		"explanation":"These are three of the several expressions by which we refer to someone’s personal name, as opposed to their family name. Formerly it was the Christian name (or baptismal name), but the religious bias in those phrases is now recognized as something to avoid in multicultural societies. First name is the term most widely used in English-speaking countries, although it presupposes the dominant European pattern of naming, in which the given name comes before the family name (surname). It creates problems in interactions with those whose culture puts the family name first. This includes some European groups: \n Croatian Hungarian Polish Serbian \n and many Asian groups including: \n Cambodian Chinese Japanese Khmer \n Korean Laotian Vietnamese \n In Arabic cultures of the Middle East, northern Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, in India, and in the Pacific (Tonga, Maori), the pattern is the same as for English. \n The term forename is grounded in the same sequential assumptions as first name. It neatly complements the French-derived surname (literally “extra name,” originally either an epithet or a family name). But this hardly outweighs the other consideration, and makes no difference to those for whom the etymology of surname is opaque. Forename also suffers from being little used in the UK (by BNC evidence) and not at all in the US (in CCAE). \n Only the term given name avoids the various complications just mentioned. It is transparent and unambiguous in crosscultural use. Despite its extra syllable, it takes up no more space than first name, and is increasingly found on official forms of all kinds. \n ♦ For more about the writing of people’s names and titles, see under forms of address. \n International English selection: Of all the possible terms, given name (and family name) are most transparent and freest of cultural presuppositions."

In American English, constructions with fit (garment that fit me / a job he was perfectly fit for) are in the majority, in data from CCAE. Yet the American scene is somewhat divided, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), with evidence to suggest that fit is more frequent in the Mid-West. It has also gained ground on the East Coast, according to DARE (vol. 2, 1991), though fitted is still strongly associated with New England.

		"title": "fix, fixed and fixing to",
		"explanation":"The verb fix has found more applications outside Britain than within. In British English its established uses are as a synonym for “fasten” ( fixed to the wall), and an alternative to “arrange,” “settle,” as in date to be fixed. The two come together in the idiom fixed in concrete. \n Elsewhere, in American, Australian and New Zealand English, fix also serves as a synonym for “mend” (as in get the car fixed), and this usage is now being taken up in Britain, by the evidence of the BNC, where the broken ankle, a broken-down car, and a dysfunctional water supply are among the various items needing to be fixed. The compound verb fix up is also known in the same sense: when we’ve fixed up your plumbing . . . \n Yet another role of fix to develop outside Britain is the sense of “prepare,” as in I’ll fix you a drink. This again is associated with American English, but also established in Canadian and Australian. Again the BNC has a sprinkling of it, suggesting that fix you some tea / a coffee / something for dinner is not alien to British speakers. In any case, it streamlines the familiar British construction fix up with to mean “arrange for,” as in I’ll fix you up with a room / a fashion accessory / a job in the organization. \n fashion accessory / a job in the organization. In American English fixing to works like the quasimodal going to, speaking of future intentions, as in He was fixing to get rid of the first one in the divorce courts. In the US it’s traditionally associated with southern speech, and therefore appears more often in the Atlanta Journal than the Christian Science Monitor or the Los Angeles Times. But its users are now to be found in urban as well as rural centres across the South Atlantic and Gulf states (Wolfram and Schilling-Estes, 1998). It also turns up in informal speech further north, and across the Canadian border, to judge by the entry in the Canadian Oxford (1998). It has yet to make its mark in British or Australian English. \n All these constructions with fix are most at home in speech and informal writing. The diversity of applications for both fix and fix(ed) up means that they can be ambiguous: \n You and the lady come with me, we’ll get you fixed up . . . \n In conversation, the context always narrows down the range of interpretations, but writing has no such aids."

Fiord, the then Norwegian spelling, established itself in Britain, and was made the primary spelling in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Webster’s Third (1986) meanwhile prioritizes fjord, which began to be used in C19 English against a backdrop of revisions to Norwegian orthography (through which fjord became the standard spelling in Norway, as in Denmark and Sweden). Both fjord and fiord are current in the US, and about equally used in American data from CCAE. But contemporary British writers clearly prefer fjord, by a factor of 3:1 in the BNC. A search of internet documents worldwide (Google, 2003) found fjord outnumbering fiord by more than 12:1. \n The shift from fiord to fjord can also be seen in the anglicized forms of Norwegian placenames such as Oslo Fjord, Hardanger Fjord, the spellings given in both the Chambers/Cambridge World Gazetteer (1988) and the Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary (1997).

	{
		"title": "flak or flack",
		"explanation":"The spelling flak is distinctly un-English, and serves to remind us that it is a German acronym which gained currency during World War II. It originally stood for Fliegerabwehrkanone (“aircraft defence gun”), and then referred to anti-aircraft fire from such guns – shells that burst into a thousand jagged pieces. In contemporary civil defence, the flak jacket is designed to protect the wearer from hostile fire. Flak has also acquired the figurative meaning “damaging criticism,” first recorded in 1968 according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). The person who takes the flak is on the metaphorical front line, and the image lends itself to the more adversarial types of journalism. In the BNC flak is occasionally spelled flack (about 1 in 8 instances), a sign of ongoing assimilation. In American English the rate is closer to 1 in 6, in data from CCAE. \n American use of the spelling flack for “damaging criticism” is intertwined with a quite different use of the word, as an informal term for a press agent or public relations officer. For example: \n . . . sounded like a flack for the baseball owners \n  . . . Reagan, once a paid flack for the American Medical Association \n Evidence from CCAE suggests that flack may be pejorative for those who “practice the craft of public relations”; and diplomatic relations could indeed suffer when the spokesperson for the Soviet ambassador becomes the embassy flack. Yet with the terms super-flack and chief White House flack, it identifies an emerging profession – even if work in the flack factory is less than glamorous. In that example, we see flack extending its use to become a byword for publicity itself, and it also serves as a verb, in: \n . . . hired a PR firm to flack the thing \n Celebrities too often flack so many products that consumers are confused \n In all this there’s other potential confusion when the flack (who puts out the publicity) is also the person who takes the flack (an alternative spelling for “damaging criticism”). The closeness of the two roles makes a neat pun in:  \n Let him who is without hype cast the first flack. But the two roles can be clearly separated if the job is explained as directing flack and damage control, or alternatively as being the community and liaison officer, a kind of flak-catcher. The spelling flak comes into its own here. \n The origins of flack as a term for a publicity agent are uncertain. Its first recorded appearances were just prior to World War II, and the Random House Dictionary (1987) connects it with Gene Flack, a Hollywood publicity agent. But eponymous derivations like this can be difficult to prove. See under eponyms, for less contentious examples."

Apart from being slightly shorter, flammable is never subject to the faint ambiguity which dogs inflammable – as to whether its in- is a negative or intensive prefix (see further under in-/im-). It is of course an intensive prefix, just as it is in the related word inflame. But with the risk of in- being read as a negative in inflammable (and failing to serve as a warning of fire), the spelling flammable is preferred by all those concerned with fire hazards. The US National Fire Protection Association adopted it in the 1920s, and this has boosted its use generally. In contemporary data from CCAE, flammable outnumbers inflammable by almost 20:1, and uses of the latter were mostly figurative, noting inflammable tempers, people and remarks. In other English-speaking countries, the move to replace inflammable on warning signs is relatively recent. It proves somewhat less frequent than flammable in BNC data, yet its meaning in the 50-odd examples is still almost always “liable to burst into flame.” The examples do however come from printed documents, whereas those for flammable are more often from spoken sources.

		"title": "flora and fauna",
		"explanation":"These two have been coupled together since 1745, when the botanist and naturalist Linnaeus published a Flora and Fauna of his native Sweden. In Roman mythology they were the names of divinities who led separate lives, Flora as the goddess of flowers, and Faunus as the god of agriculture and shepherds. In C20 English flora acquired a new realm in references to the micro-organisms that inhabit the internal canals and external organs of animals. In a sense this is a takeover, as it allows the term flora to subsume both fungi and bacteria (i.e. both plant and animal life). \n Both words are used in modern English as collective words, referring to the whole gamut of plant (or animal) life in a particular location. In such references there’s no need to seek a plural form, and writers may choose a singular or plural verb in agreement, depending on whether their discussion focuses on the collectivity of species, or on individual varieties:  \n The flora of our planet is under threat of extinction. \n The flora of our planet are under threat of extinction. \n (See further under agreement section 1, and collective nouns.) \n When the flora (or fauna) of more than one region has to be mentioned in the same breath, a plural form is needed.

		"title": "floruit",
		"explanation":"Borrowed by historians from Latin, this word means literally “s/he flourished.” When followed by a date or a span of time, it indicates a significant point or period in someone’s life, and it provides a historical benchmark for someone whose exact dates of birth and death are not known. The date or time accompanying the floruit (abbreviated as fl.) may be drawn from circumstantial evidence, such as when the person was appointed to a particular position, or when s/he produced an outstanding literary or artistic work. For William of Ockham (or Occam) the year in which he was put on trial for heresy (1328) is the most precisely known date of his life; and since he managed to escape to Munich and lived in sanctuary for some years after, fl. 1328 serves to put a date on his career."

		"title": "flotation or floatation",
		"explanation":"The spelling floatation shows the word’s hybrid origins in the English verb float and the latinate suffix -ation. It was the earlier spelling (dating from the start of C19), and is still occasionally seen, as in the manufacturer’s notes for an inflatable product that stores easy in raft or can be blown up to add extra floatation. The fully latinized spelling flotation appeared later in C19, though never etymologically justifiable, as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes. In financial reporting it is nevertheless the standard spelling, ubiquitous in references to stock market flotations or public flotation of shares. These account for more than 95% of its citations in the BNC, though flotation tanks and aircraft emergency flotation systems apply the newer spelling to the original meaning. \n In American English flotation is also very much more frequent than floatation, in the ratio of 12:1 in CCAE. It commonly appears in references to water safety equipment (flotation devices/units/systems), and in technological uses such as mineral flotation processes. Financial applications like those exemplified in the BNC data also boost its numbers. \n The simple noun float serves in British and Australian English as an informal substitute for floatation in the financial sense of raising money for a company through an issue of shares. Float is also the term used by Australians, Canadians and the British for petty cash used to facilitate transactions at charity events etc. Neither of these uses of float is possible in the US, where float is bespoken as the term for the monetary value of checks (cheques) outstanding at a particular time."

		"title": "flounder or founder",
		"explanation":"Hardly surprising that these get confused when you know that the first may indeed owe its existence to the second. Founder meaning “sink to the bottom (of the sea)” is commonly used of ships, or enterprises that come to grief. Flounder meaning “move clumsily” often seems to involve struggling close to the ground, as in the fisherman’s story from the Angler in Wales (1834), in which “man and fish lay floundering together in the rapids” . . . and it no doubt got away. \n The origins of founder are in medieval French, whereas those of flounder, first recorded in 1592, are not at all certain. Some scholars have suggested that it is a blend of flounce and founder: others that it is simply an embellishment of founder with fl, a sound unit which seems to carry a subliminal meaning of “heavy movement” (see further under phonesthemes). In popular etymology however, the verb flounder may also owe something to a well-known fish (also flounder) that inhabits the sea bottom. The fish itself derives its name from Scandinavia, with cognates in Norwegian and Swedish. \n wedish. The latter influence seems to be still at work in a memorial plaque set on the wall of a certain men’s club: \n IN MEMORY OF FORMER MEMBERS OF THE SPORTS FISHING CLUB, WHOSE BOAT FLOUNDERED ON THE PT.

Influenza maintains its dignity in bureaucratic and medical contexts, but flu occurs across a much wider range of prose, in three times as many nonfiction sources (including journalism and other nonfiction intended for the general reader), as well as in fiction.

In North America this never displaced flutist as the standard term, and flutist still dominates in citations from CCAE, by about 25:1. In Canada, flutist is also the standard term, as the Canadian Oxford (1998) explains.

		"title": "flyer or flier",
		"explanation":"All major dictionaries make these spellings equal, but they are less equal in British than in American English. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) puts flyer first, on the strength of “recent quotations,” which are indeed spread through C20 and over many of the word’s meanings. In BNC data, flyer outnumbers flier by more than 3:1. Their relative frequencies are more like 3:2 in American data from CCAE, and Webster’s Third (1986) gives priority to flier. \n In some applications of the word, flier may be preferred, even in the UK. This holds when the reference is to an aviator, especially a World War II flier. But the jet-setting passenger may be either a frequent flyer or frequent flier, depending on the airline; and the metaphorical high flyer / high flier can make it either way. The fastest player on the rugby field is the flier, but both spellings are used in reference to race horses, pole vaulters and those who fly kites. The use of flier to refer to an express train is steadily giving way to flyer, even in North America, and rapid transit companies operating taxis, buses and ferries make the most of flyer in their business names. The American idiom take a flyer / flier on, meaning “take a risk (especially financial)” is also increasingly seen with the y spelling: \n I might take a flyer at politics again. Americans are still divided over whether flyer or flier should be the spelling for the leaflet distributed for political, social or commercial purposes, whereas there’s no doubt in Britain that it should be flyer, as in church flyer or flyer for the day trip. \n Overall then flyer seems to be consolidating and setting itself apart from crier, drier etc., which, as the Oxford Dictionary notes, are more regular in terms of the rule for turning final -y into i before a suffix (see -y>-i-). Yet the rule makes greater demands on the reader when the word’s stem has only three letters; and flyer is easier than flier if the word has to be understood with little support from the context. For ad hoc and figurative uses, it will be more reliable."

In the Langscape survey (1998–2001) the form with single s ( focused) was endorsed by just on three-quarters of the respondents.

Only fogey appears in BNC data, and it’s the more frequent of the two spellings in American evidence from CCAE, where both do occur (the raw figures are 14:10). The word’s obscure origins would help to explain the lack of conviction about its spelling. It seems to have originated as a nickname for an invalid soldier, and was prefaced by “old” from its first recorded appearances in late C18. Attempts to explain its etymology by reference to “foggy” seem a little far-fetched. \n Both Webster’s and the Oxford give the plural of fog(e)y as “fogies also fogeys,” and their relative frequencies in the databases confirm that order. Fogies is the commoner of the two in both CCAE and the BNC – despite the preference for fogey in the singular.

The examples also show that it can be applied as a synonym for “people,” and as a nonsexist substitute for “men.” But it very often serves as a modifier of other nouns, as in folk hero, folk memory, folk wisdom, where it taps traditions in the community; and in folk festival, folk melody, folk singer, where it connects with popular cultures of the past. \n Folks is sometimes disparaged as oldfashioned or provincial, but it has some contemporary uses. Its connotations are familiar and informal, as when referring to someone’s relatives as his folks, the folks at home, and also in the unpretentious “just folks.” In old folks it remains faintly indulgent. Its vocative use, as in Hi folks or Sorry folks – though long associated with American entertainers – now falls from the lips of British comp`eres and tour guides.

		"title": "folk etymology",
		"explanation":"Popular interpretation of a word’s structure and meaning can alter its spelling in the course of time. Loanwords are particularly susceptible to folk etymology, as English speakers seek to regularize them in terms of words they are familiar with. So the word amok (borrowed from Malay) is reinterpreted and respelled by some as amuck, as if it was a composite of the medieval English prefix a- (as in abroad, awry) and the word muck. Like most folk etymologies, it only fits where it touches and makes little sense of the word. Obsolete elements of English are also subject to folk etymology. Thus bridegroom suggests a spurious connection with horses, which comes from using groom instead of the unfamiliar gome as its second element. (Gome was an alternative word for “man” in early English.) In modern English colleague (based on French collegue ` ) has acquired an a, presumably because of the idea that it’s someone with whom you are in league. Folk etymologies are by definition not true etymologies. See further under etymology."

Font is the spelling used for the ceremonial baptismal font – often the most ancient piece of furniture in English churches. The spelling fount survives in poetic diction as a synonym for fountain, and in more general use as a figurative word for “source,” as in fount of wisdom. \n The second word, used for a set of printing type, is modeled on the French fonte from fondre meaning “cast or found (a metal).” It was spelled font, fond and even fund in C17, but then became confused with the first word font/fount. As often, the more radical spelling font crossed the Atlantic to become the standard term among printers in North America, while fount consolidated its position in Britain. Australians and Canadians both go with font; and it’s the form used everywhere in the world for the choice of typefaces in computer programs. \n International English selection: Since font is the spelling used for “typeface” everywhere outside Britain, and inside Britain among computer users, it’s the natural choice for international usage."

Its origins are rather obscure, and traditions linking it with Caxton in C15, and Sir John Spielman, a C16 papermaker, cannot be confirmed. The earliest hard evidence of the foolscap watermark is in a C17 copy of Rushworth’s Historical Collections, kept in the British Museum. The enigma of its origin made it a topic of speculation, and partisan rumor had it that the fool’s cap was substituted for the royal coat of arms during the Rump Parliament (1648–53), on the paper used to record the daily records of the House."

The first is a conventional, stripped-down expression typical of conversation or no-nonsense reporting, whereas the second elaborates the individual measures to the point of redundancy. When measurements serve as modifiers of nouns or adjectives, the same variation emerges: a six-foot pole versus she is six feet tall. As in these examples, the singular is often found in standard sizes, usually hyphenated, as in two-inch nail, 25-yard line, ten ton truck – while the plural expression underscores the fact that the measure is specific to the case: nearly six feet tall and 13 stones when I’m at my best. \n The constructions with feet are commoner in American than British English, by the evidence of language databases. Numerical expressions with feet tall outnumber those with foot tall by almost 10:1 in data from CCAE, whereas it’s 5:1 in the BNC. The greater use of the plural unit by Americans reflects their general preference for formal agreement (see agreement). \n greement). The singular unit is used the world over in imperial and metric expressions that serve as modifiers, e.g. two hundred-pound weights, a five-kilo pack.

Though older grammar books class for as a full coordinating conjunction, it does not allow deletion of a repeated subject, which is one of the criteria used by modern grammarians (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985). \n Compare and, but and for in the following: \n He had no transport and came by taxi. \n He had no transport but came by taxi. \n He came by taxi for (he) had no transport. \n See further under conjunctions."

It also notes the “chiefly US” use of forever in place of for ever, and the unspaced form is listed without comment in Webster’s Third (1986). Yet for ever is rare in data from the BNC, and forever quite often used where for ever might have been expected, by the Oxford’s comments. See for example: \n I could stay here forever. \n Christian marriage was forever. \n . . . etched forever in my brain. \n The tendency to use forever instead of for ever is as strong in the British database as in the American (CCAE).

In grammatical terms it makes a full adverbial phrase out of the word free, which otherwise seems ordinary and even negligible as the complementary adverb/adjective in get a cup of coffee free (see further under complementation). The phrase itself is perfectly grammatical if we allow that free is a zero adverb, which can combine with for just like for ever, for once. In contexts other than advertising, people sometimes find for free excessive when free would suffice.

Forcible suggests that either sheer physical force or some other inescapable factor was felt or brought to bear on the situation, particularly when some other means might have been used. The forcible removal of interjectors from a meeting implies that the strong arm of the law was exerted against them; and a forcible reminder is one which expresses itself through physical circumstances, not the spoken word itself. \n Forceful just implies that noticeable energy is or was used in an action or activity, to maximize its impact.

Its meaning is no longer separable from such words, and it varied in Old English, being separative, privative or intensive depending on the formation. The lack of transparent meaning helps to explain the confusion with fore-, even when it could make a difference. \n In principle, fore- and for- mark the contrast in two pairs of words: compare: \n forebear “ancestor” and forbear “hold back” \n forego “go before” forgo “do without” \n Confusion about the prefix usually means that forbear is also used for “ancestor,” and forego for “do without,” and dictionaries do recognize them as alternative spellings. Though it might seem preferable to keep the spellings apart, this doubling up is less problematic than one might expect. The two meanings of forbear are distinguished by their grammar, one being a noun, the other a verb. And forgo can be spelled forego with little chance of misunderstanding, since forego (“go before”) is very rare as an active verb, and mostly survives in fixed expressions like foregone conclusion.

With serious subjects such as religion or law, most people allow that formal language is somehow right, and would feel that a preacher or judge who relied heavily on colloquialisms was behaving unprofessionally. But those who use formal language in ordinary situations are likely to be seen as pretentious and unsympathetic to their audience. This is often an issue in business or institutional letter writing, where the writer must strike a balance between the need to communicate with dignity and seriousness, and the need to speak as pleasantly and directly as possible to the reader.

When rank involved is a subordinate step, e.g. Associate Professor, Lieutenant Colonel, the title given on the envelope and any internal address is exactly that, whereas the letter salutation by courtesy makes it the higher rank: Professor, Colonel etc. The title on the envelope and internal address include the addressee’s initials or given name, whereas the salutation inside simply uses the surname. \n *Titles for the English-speaking world include: \n Dr. for medical practitioners (except surgeons), and holders of university doctorates, Ph.D., D.Sc., D.Litt. etc. \n Professor for university professors \n The Honorable Mr. Justice for judges \n Captain/Major/Lieutenant etc. according to rank, for members of the armed forces \n Reverend for ministers of most branches of the Christian church, including the Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox. (For the conventions on combining Reverend with other names, see names section 2.) \n Rabbi for Jewish clerics \n Senator for members of the federal upper house in the US, Australia, Canada \n Sir for holders of knighthoods \n Dame for women who have been made Dame of the British Empire, or admitted to certain other orders of chivalry \n  Lady for the wives of knights or those knighted \n Mr. for men not included in any of the above groups \n Mrs. for married women not included in any of the above groups \n Ms. for women who prefer a title that does not express marital status \n Miss, an older title for unmarried women, and for young girls \n Master, an older title for young boys, little used nowadays \n The use of stops in Dr(.), Mr(.) etc. is discussed in abbreviations section 2. For plural addressees with Dr., Mr., Mrs., Ms., see plurals section 3 \n The convention of addressing a married woman by her husband’s name or initials (as Mrs. J[ohn] Evans) is disappearing, except in the most formal correspondence. (This once applied to a widow as well as a married woman, and served to distinguish both from a divorcee who used her own given name and initial. The convention is no longer observed.) But letters addressed to married women jointly with their husbands still usually carry the husband’s initial or name, as in Mr. and Mrs. J(ohn) Evans. The practice of identifying them separately, as in Mr. J. and Mrs. P. Evans, is not yet widespread. \n *Distinctive titles for European addressees, corresponding to Mr. and Mrs.: \n France Monsieur Madame \n Netherlands Meneer Mevrouw \n Germany Herr Frau \n Spain Se ˜nor Se ˜nora \n  Italy Signor Signora \n Note that Italians increasingly use Mr./Mrs., and that the English titles are usual when the addressees are Portuguese, Greek or from Eastern Europe. \n *Titles for Asian addressees: \n Burma U Daw \n India – Hindi Shri Shrimanthi \n India – Sikh Sardar Sardarni \n Laos Thao Nang \n Malaysia Encik Puan \n Thailand Nai Nang \n As forms of address for Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian and Sri Lankan people, the titles of Mr. and Mrs. should be used. \n For more details, see Naming Systems of Ethnic Groups (1990). \n 2 Letter salutations do not necessarily address the recipient in the same terms as those used in the delivery address on the envelope or above the salutation within the letter. In many kinds of correspondence they require an active choice by the writer, and Dear Sir can no longer be taken for granted or used with impunity. The salutation should establish an appropriate relationship with the reader, and usually reflects their degree of acquaintance. \n a) If the correspondents are at all acquainted, it’s likely that first names will be used in the salutation: Dear John, Dear Helen. But if the correspondents are not already acquainted, or if the recipient of the letter is unknown, there are a number of options. \n b) If only the recipient’s name is known, it’s conventional to use title plus surname: Dear Mr. Brown or Dear M(r)s. Brown, depending on gender. The choice between Mrs. and Ms. in this situation is delicate. Not all women like to be addressed as Ms.; and yet with Mrs. you imply that the surname following is her married name. (See further under Miss, Mrs. or Ms.) If the preferred title is not known, Dear Patricia Brown is increasingly used as a semiformal salutation. \n c) If only surname and an initial are known, and the gender of the recipient is unknown, the alternatives are to use Dear P. Brown, or Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. Brown \n d) If only the gender of the recipient is known, it’s still possible to use Dear Sir or Dear Madam, though they set a formal tone for the letter \n e) If neither gender nor name of the recipient are known, the options are to use Dear Sir/Madam, or else some relevant job or role title, such as Dear Manager, Dear Teacher, Dear Customer. \n f) If the letter is written to a company rather than a particular individual within it, there are two possibilities: either to use Dear Jeffries Pty Ltd as the salutation, or just the company name without a preliminary “Dear.” The latter often seems appropriate, and is often used in North America."

		"title": "fortuitous or fortunate",
		"explanation":"Fortuitous has extended its range in C20 English. Fowler noticed in the 1920s that it seemed sometimes to be a synonym for fortunate, and Webster’s English Usage (1989) provides a number of American citations for this from the end of World War II. Webster’s Third (1986) registers fortuitous as meaning both “happening by chance” and “lucky.” But the second meaning is still developing in British English, judging by BNC evidence, and seems rather to represent an intermediate stage of “happening by a good chance.” The boundaries between this optimistic sense and the original neutral sense are often ambiguous, and the optimism is often a construct of the context, as in: \n The storm had been fortuitous, an extra. \n It is perhaps fortuitous that Healing appeared when he did, his milling business helping to fill the void. \n Other citations in the BNC suggest writers’ awareness of the new meaning while attempting to use the old. The author who speaks of fortuitous good fortune is presumably trying to keep them apart. In scientific writing, the older sense of randomness is less challenged, and supported by the cool factuality of the context: \n Many modern houses have little fortuitous ventilation because [of] improved standards of insulation. \n But the second meaning grows naturally in ad hoc narratives and history, when a strictly fortuitous event or observation serves as the foundation for future benefit or progress, as in the first pair of examples. The optimistic meaning “happening by good chance” is now recognized in some British dictionaries, including New Oxford (1998), though with a caution that it is “informal.” This must reflect the fact that it’s subject to doubt, like many items stemming from the Fowler (1926) canon. The BNC citations nevertheless show it being used in a variety of prose contexts, and certainly those intended for a general readership. \n Whether fortuitous will move further in British English into the semantic realms of fortunate remains to be seen, but the chances are that it will, given that it’s established in American English. At any rate, this all indicates that fortuitous (and fortuitously) are increasingly unreliable as ways of referring to pure chance."

And in data from the BNC, forums is the preferred plural, outnumbering the other by more than 4:1. International forums, political forums, planning forums, recruitment forums are some of its numerous applications. The Latin plural fora is not however confined to discussions of Roman history. It enjoys scattered use in official documents that speak of legal and quasi-legal fora in which individuals may press their cases, and legal writers in the US “persist in using the pedantic fora,” according to Garner (1998). Other support for fora could come from the digital community, where the more formal type of internet discussion is sometimes called a forum, and its plural fora. Still forums is the dominant plural on the internet, found in more than 98% of all instances in a Google search. See further under -um."

To have it also in fourteen but not in forty seems perverse, especially when records show that it was spelled “fourty” in earlier times, and was only displaced by forty in C18.

For some people, piss, frig, arse and turd might be added to the group, though for others the uses of those words are more diverse, and not necessarily associated with swearing and offensive language. There is no categorical inventory of four-letter words, and, despite the examples so far, even the criterion of having four letters gives way. Some would regard prick in its taboo sense as a four-letter word, because it represents a body part whose name can be used in offensive references to other people. Those seem to be the defining characteristics of four-letter words, and serve to distinguish them from other general-purpose swear words, such as bloody and bugger. \n Because four-letter words are taboo in many contexts, in printed texts they have traditionally been replaced by a set of asterisks, or hinted at by use of their first letter only, followed by a long dash or three spaces. Other strategies involve using a substitute word which begins with the same sound, such as sugar or shoot for shit (sometimes called euphemistic dysphemisms).

The flower is sometimes spelled frangipanni or frangipane. \n Frangipane is also the word for a pastry tart filled with cream, almonds and sugar. Larousse gastronomique (1984) associates it with the first word, and the fact that the Marquis’s perfume was based on bitter almonds.

		"title": "frenchification",
		"explanation":"French culture has always been held in special respect by the English, and innumerable French words and phrases have been borrowed over the centuries. Apart from expressing things for which there was no suitable English word, French expressions often seemed to have a certain something about them, a “je ne sais quoi” which recommended them to the user. Because the Frenchness of such borrowings is part of their value, unusual features of their spelling and pronunciation may be consciously maintained long after they might naturally have been assimilated to conform with ordinary English words. So ballet, as part of high culture, has kept its French pronunciation, whereas bullet, borrowed in the same century, has become fully anglicized. The desire to keep French loanwords looking French accounts for the preservation and even extension of their accents. So creche and creme are often given circumflexes in English, where in French they have grave accents. Other words acquire accents in English which they never have in French: chalet ˆ , compote ˆ , coterie ˆ , toupee´ (a refashioning of French toupet). \n This habit of making loanwords more French than the French is also seen in the English addition of an -e to caviare, chaperone and others. The reversing of earlier anglicized spellings shows the same inclination. So omelet was remade as omelette, and French -que superimposed on the earlier -ck in cheque/chequer (see check or cheque) – at least in British English. Loanwords from classical sources (Greek and Latin) have been refashioned according to French models, as was program (respelled as programme), inquire (as enquire), and honor, labor etc. confirmed as honour, labour etc. The preference for French-influenced spellings intensified in Victorian England, and is enshrined in C21 British English, whereas American English has been little touched by it. Usage in Canada and Australia is mixed, though Australians tend more to the British, and Canadians to the American – except that Canadians have additional exposure to French variants through the official policy of bilingualism."

Yet responses to the Langscape survey in 1998 suggested otherwise, with 70% of respondents (from among hundreds worldwide) indicating their preference for frescos.

Worldwide the spelling is a swinger, and the Langscape survey 1998–2001 found fulfill in the majority by just 51%, with clear evidence that it was preferred by younger respondents (those under 45). Fulfill is easier and more consistent, given the sense connection with fill in the second syllable, and the fact that double l is always used in fulfilled and fulfilling. The same considerations apply in choosing between fulfillment and fulfilment. The variation between the two spellings is a legacy of the more general problem of final l. (See further under single for double.) \n International English selection: The widespread use of fulfill, especially among younger people, its consistency with inflected forms, and transparency in terms of derivation, all make it preferable for use in international communication."

		"title": "full stop, period or stop",
		"explanation":"The most frequent of all punctuation marks is the full stop, its usual name in Britain, though among British editors and printers it’s termed the full point (see Hart’s Rules and Copy-editing, 1992). Australian usage echoes the British on this, while in North America (the US and Canada) the mark goes by the name period. Fowler (1926) used both names, differentiating them by function (he used full stop when it marked the boundary of a sentence, and period for its role in abbreviating words). But current British practice uses full stop for both these functions, or else the short form stop, though this also serves as a cover term for any punctuation mark. The terms full stop / period / stop are also applied to the mark used in punctuating numbers and dates. All three functions bear close investigation. \n 1 The full stop /period at the end of a sentence. Stops are used at the end of most types of sentences, whether they are grammatically complete or fragments. The full stop / period gives way to an exclamation mark when the utterance it marks is intended by the writer to have exclamatory value (see exclamations). If the sentence is a direct question, the stop gives way to a question mark: \n Why don’t you take it? \n But in indirect questions, and questions which function as requests or invitations to do something, a simple stop is still used. \n They asked why I didn’t take it. \n Do you mind taking it with you. \n (For the position of the final stop of a quoted or parenthetical sentence, see quotation marks section 3c, and brackets sections 2 and 3.) \n Full stops / periods do not normally appear in headlines, captions or headings, although some editors use them when the heading/caption runs over onto a second line. They are not used in the stub or column headings in tables, nor in vertical lists. See further under tables and lists. \n 2 The full stop / period in abbreviated words. In the past stops have been the means of marking abbreviated words or sets of them, in both upper and lower case. Current trends are towards removing them from upper case abbreviations, and increasingly when giving people’s initials (see names section 3). The use of stops with lower case abbreviations is an area of great variability (see abbreviations section 2). Stops are never used in the symbols for SI units (see abbreviations section 1). \n  3 The full stop / period with numbers and dates. Stops serve as a separating device among figures: a) in lists. Successive numbers or enumerating letters are often accompanied by full stops: \n 1. 2. 3. or 1a. 2a. 3a. or 1.a. 2.a. 3.a. \n Brackets 1) 2) 3) are an alternative device, and can be usefully combined with full stops, especially when there are several subdivisional systems of numbering: 1.a.(i), 1.a.(ii). (For the use of single or paired brackets, see brackets section 1.) Note that while brackets are effective with lower case roman numbers, they are best avoided with roman capitals because of possible misreading. Stops are preferable there: 1.(a) I. \n b) in dates and times of day: \n 26.4.89 7.30 pm \n c) in sums of money: \n $24.20 $1.32 \n d) as the decimal point: \n 0.08% 3.1417 \n (See further under numbers and number style.)

But scanty records leave much in doubt. The Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) record of the positive meaning drops out in C16, except for a C19 reference to it as the “original meaning” – suggesting that some still found a duality in the word, despite the dominance of the negative meaning. Since then, the negative meaning is often taken for granted as the only one, though Webster’s Third (1986) registers the positive meaning as well. Its currency is evident from the intensified criticism of it from mid-C20 (Webster’s English Usage, 1989), and numerous examples from CCAE and the BNC have fulsome applied in positive or at least neutral ways, as in: \n Green was fulsome in his praise for Barker’s determined efforts to reach an equitable settlement. \n Some examples suggest the writer’s awareness of the possible connotative problem with fulsome, and his/her efforts to make it unambiguously positive. \n The tribute may sound fulsome, but Modigliani showed exceptional appreciation of his ability. \n As Webster’s Usage notes, fulsome may in fact be more neutral than the C20 debate has allowed. If the “fullness” described is to be seen as good (or bad), this needs to be indicated through accompanying detail. Without it, fulsome seems to take on negative connotations by default. It then becomes a kind of weasel word (see under that heading). \n Fulsome is relatively unambiguous when it refers to sheer size or volume, shown also in current database evidence, both British and American. \n Fulsome bodies filled the landing \n His voice wasn’t its usual fulsome boom. \n Once the furor has reached its fulsome fury . . . \n Clearly fulsome maintains several senses in current English – and this is recognized by Merriam-Webster (2000) as well as New Oxford (1998)."

These applications have however gathered steam more recently, especially since World War II. Webster’s English Usage (1989) suggests that advertising for such things as fun furs and fun cars has helped it along, though many of the new collocations are quite general, witness fun people, fun place, fun time etc. Examples like these are found in both British and American databases, though they tend to occur in interactive writing intended for a broad public – hence perhaps New Oxford’s (1998) note that this attributive use of fun is “informal.” Yet some examples like fun fair and fun run are institutionalized, and could scarcely be rejected from serious prose on grounds of informality.

In fact farther is simply a C15 respelling of further, while further itself seems to be a comparative form of the word forth. \n The idea that farther and further work in different realms is not sustainable. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) comments that C19 usage on this point was often arbitrary; and Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes that both forms are now freely applied to “spatial, temporal or metaphorical distance.” Dictionaries generally give both words as meaning “additional(ly),” although Merriam-Webster (2000) notes that further is squeezing the other one out of the adverbial role (e.g. what further annoyed me). Authorities everywhere agree that only further can be used as a conjunct equivalent to “moreover,” and as a verb. \n Though the use of farther is declining everywhere, it persists more strongly in the US than in the UK. The ratio of further to farther is about 10:1 in American data from CCAE, whereas it’s 70:1 in the BNC. The low frequency of farther gives it formal and literary connotations, as noted in some British dictionaries. The two forms are more closely matched in the superlative. Furthest remains the commoner of the two in the BNC by a factor of 3:1, whereas in CCAE the situation is reversed, with farthest turning up more often, by about 2:1. Its use in rhetorical parlance (e.g. the farthest galaxy) may help to account for this."

		"title": "future tense",
		"explanation":"English, like other Germanic languages, has no special suffix to add to its verbs to make the future tense. Instead it uses auxiliary verbs, or the present tense along with some other indicator of futurity. The best known auxiliaries are will, as in you will receive, and shall as in I shall retire. (For the traditional differences between these two, see shall or will.) \n Modern grammars show that English has various other means of indicating futurity. They include semi-auxiliaries and phrasal verbs such as: \n be going to be to be about to be on the point of \n (See further under auxiliaries section 3.) The first of these (I am going to) is the most straightforward with no particular implications that limit its use. The second (I am to) suggests that the projected event is the result of an arrangement made by other parties, and not something to decide for oneself. The last two (I am about to / I am on the point of ) show that the projected event is imminent, and not just at some undetermined time in the future. The sense of imminence and immediacy is stronger with on the point of than with about to. \n In certain circumstances, the plain present tense can be used to express futurity. An accompanying adverb (or adverbial phrase) which expresses future time is sufficient in a simple statement, and used very often in conversation: \n  They come tomorrow. \n My course finishes in two weeks time. \n In complex sentences (see clauses section 3), a plain present tense can be used to express future in the subordinate clause, provided that the main clause has one of the future auxiliaries: \n I’m going to dye my hair if you do. \n Next year we’ll celebrate when the yachts arrive."

		"title": "gabardine or gaberdine",
		"explanation":" Both spellings go back to C16, when they were alternatives for a loose-fitting overgarment, sometimes called a “smock,” sometimes a “cloak.” Their application to the closely woven twill fabric dates from early C20, and it’s now the dominant meaning. In American English, the standard spelling is overwhelmingly gabardine, by the evidence of CCAE. This accords with the fact that Webster’s Third (1986) associates gabardine primarily with the fabric, while gaberdine (which it associates with the traditional garment) is hardly ever mentioned. In British English gaberdine has also been the C20 spelling for a type of raincoat, made from the fabric of the same name. This has probably reinforced the use of gaberdine for the fabric itself, and made it more popular than gabardine for that meaning among writers represented in the BNC, in the ratio of 5:2. The British preference for gaberdine is in line with the fact that the Oxford Dictionary (1989) gives it priority. A regional divergence in spelling thus seems to be opening up. So much for fashion! \n The word itself is a curiosity. It has no relatives in English to provide analogies and to pin the spelling down. Its French antecedents gauvardine and galvardine lend support to gabardine, and also show how scholars link it with the old German word wallevart (“pilgrimage”). They suggest that the cloak of gabardine was the uniform of pilgrims on their travels."

		"title": "gaff, gaffe and gaffer",
		"explanation":"Gaff and gaffe represent several different words – two of which are derived ultimately from a Celtic word for “boathook,” which appeared in medieval French and English as gaffe. It became gaff in modern English, and has much of the original meaning when applied to the hooked pole used by fishermen for landing large fish. In another nautical use it refers to the spar on the upper edge of a fore-and-aft sail, as in a gaff-rigged boat. \n In French meanwhile, gaffe continued to refer to a boathook, and it is from nautical accidents (French sailors getting hooked on their own gaffs) that the meaning of gaffe as “social blunder” is believed to derive. The idiom make/made a gaffe came into English in early C20, embodied in the French spelling. \n Independent of all this is the slang word gaff found in blow the gaff, recorded from 1812 on. Its origins are obscure, although gaff in this context seems to reflect the meanings “cheat” or “trick” of an identical word from the underworld. Yet an earlier form of the phrase (blow the gab) shows its association with the gift of the gab, and with glib or specious talk. Some dictionaries suggest a link between blow the gaff and gaffe (“social blunder”), but this is anachronistic by the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) datings. \n Gaffer meaning the chief electrician on a movie or TV set owes nothing to either gaff or gaffe. A contracted form of godfather, it earlier developed meanings of its own, including “old man” and “foreman.”"

The existence of rival pollsters is a challenge to owners of the original concept, and pressure to maintain the capital spills over onto the following word: hence the Gallup Poll. The capital letter still stands to prevent Gallup being confused with gallop, though they sound identical and do indeed merge in folk etymology, on the assumption that the “gallop poll” anticipates a runaway victory for one party or the other. \n When suffixes are added to the verb gallop, it simply becomes galloped/galloping or galloper, in all varieties of English – in line with the broadest rules of English spelling.

In British data from the BNC it usually qualifies a plural noun, as in the examples just given, but American examples in CCAE have it with singular/collective nouns as well, in cash/opportunity/talent galore. Though borrowed in C17, its Irish origins seem always to have raised the question of its acceptability in standard English.

Yet gasses is used for the noun plural at much the same level in data from the BNC and CCAE (around 2% of all instances).

		"title": "gauge or gage",
		"explanation":"These spellings have been used to distinguish two different words: gauge for “measure” or “measuring instrument,” and gage for the old word “pledge.” Gauge is an eccentric spelling in terms of English letter-sound correspondences, the only one of its kind. The not uncommon misspelling “guage” (which puts the vowels into the more familiar sequence of words like language) appears in about 7% of all instances of the word on the internet, by a Google search (2002). Gage is a much more natural spelling for the sound of the word whichever sense is intended, and it was in fact used for both words in past centuries. \n The distinction between gauge (“measure/r”) and gage (“pledge”) is nevertheless upheld in both Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989), though they do acknowledge the use of gage for gauge. Random House Dictionary (1987) notes that gage is particularly used as the spelling for “measure/r” in technical contexts, and its firm foothold there may help to establish it more generally, as noun and verb. But in CCAE gauge occurs about three times as often as gage; and in BNC data, gauge rules the roost. Its range is enhanced by figurative uses of the verb, as in Can you gauge what a market’s worth, which make up about 40% of the total instances. \n There’s little need now to preserve the two spellings, with the uses of gage as “pledge” obsolescent, and those of gauge/gage increasing with every new measuring device. The acceptance of gage for all uses would rid English of one of its anomalies."

	{
		"title": "gauntlet or gantlet",
		"explanation":"The idiom run the ga(u)ntlet is probably opaque to most users, and the alternative spellings ultimately connect with two different words. Gauntlet, also spelled gantlet, is French for “small glove” (i.e. one covering only the wrist). It properly appears in throw down / pick up the ga(u)ntlet, the medieval gesture for issuing and accepting a challenge to a duel. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986) agree on this. But Webster’s finds a different etymology for the word in run the ga(u)ntlet, in a former Swedish military punishment called gatlopp (literally gata, “road,” and lop, “course”), which was anglicized as gantlope in C17. It involved two rows of soldiers armed with clubs and other weapons, between which the hapless prisoner had to pass. This likely explanation made gantlet the preferred spelling in run the gantlet in earlier American dictionaries, although both spellings are allowed. Instances of gauntlet outnumber those of gantlet in CCAE data by about 5:2. \n Figurative applications of run the ga(u)ntlet (“go through a testing ordeal”) overlap somewhat with those of run the gamut (“cover the whole range”), as in: \n The farmer has had his good crops and his drought. He has run the gamut. \n Gamut, like ga(u)ntlet, is a rather obscure word. It comes from medieval music, a blend of gamma, the Greek “letter C,” the lowest note on the musical scale of Guido d’Arezzo, and Latin ut, literally “that,” but pointing to the upper end of the scale. The ascending scale is conventionally explained by an acrostic hymn to St. John, whose successive lines give the names of the major tones (re, mi, fa etc.). Gamut meant the whole musical scale, hence its nonmusical sense of an entire range. Covering the full gamut of experience would include the most challenging or threatening part, where you run the ga(u)ntlet."

		"title": "gay",
		"explanation":"Because the standard use of this word has changed dramatically since World War II, it needs careful handling. The older meaning of gay (“lighthearted”) is still there in the adverb gaily and the abstract noun gaiety, but the adjective gay now usually means “homosexual.” In that sense it can be applied to both men and women, and so if one speaks of either a gay young man or a gay woman, it is potentially a comment on their sexual orientation, whether or not so intended. But when used as a noun, gay regularly means “a homosexual male,” as in: \n Sydney gays and lesbians are preparing for the annual mardi gras. \n The abstract noun gayness also connotes homosexuality, though it was earlier just a synonym for gaiety. \n This newish meaning for gay seems in fact to have been around before World War II in American prison and underworld slang, as a reference in Ersine’s 1935 Underworld and Prison Slang shows us. British evidence from C19 shows that gay (as an adjective) had a slang role meaning “licentious or living by prostitution.” To say that a woman was “living a gay life” was to imply that she was “no better than she ought to be.” \n  Gay is not the only English word to develop alternative meanings in the course of time. In this case, the older and newer do not sit comfortably side by side. When the older sense (“lighthearted”) is required, either that word or one of its near-synonyms in “elated,” “cheerful,” “merry” or “in high spirits” is more reliable nowadays, and avoids any possible double entendre."

		"title": "gender",
		"explanation":"Some style guides insist that gender is a grammatical term, not to be used in discussing the roles of men and women in ordinary life. Dictionaries often reinforce this view, by labeling the use of gender to mean “sex” as colloquial, jocular or “loose.” In fact, gender is used in serious writing in two ways: as a synonym for sex (i.e. physical–sexual identity); and in contrast to it (as one’s socially or culturally constructed identity). The first rather than the second sense would seem to be the focus of compounds such as: \n gender-bias gender-marked \n gender-neutral gender-specific \n (See further under sex or gender.) \n 1 Grammatical gender. When codifying language, traditional grammarians used the notion of gender to classify nouns into groups. Where there are two types, the categories are labeled “masculine” and “feminine”; and where there are three: “masculine,” “feminine” and “neuter” (= neither masculine nor feminine). The classification has little to do with male or female. Words for inanimate things may be classed as “masculine” or “feminine,” and what is masculine in one language may be feminine in the next: a cloud is masculine in French (le nuage) and feminine in German (die Wolke). “Masculine,” “feminine” and “neuter” are just convenient labels for classes of nouns which take different forms of the definite article and of adjectives. In modern English there are no such classes of nouns. All nouns take the same definite article the, and the same forms of adjectives. \n 2 Natural gender. English grammar makes us conscious of gender in the third person singular pronouns, with he, she, him, her, his, hers. But here it’s a matter of natural not grammatical gender, since the pronouns are applied according to the sex of the person being referred to. So she is used after a reference to “mother,” and he to a “father.” In a language with full-blown grammatical gender, the pronoun for “she” would also be used after any “feminine” noun, and the one for “he” after “masculine” nouns. \n Because the English pronouns are so firmly associated with natural gender, the traditional use of masculine forms to express generic human identity is now felt to be unfortunate and ambiguous, if not sexist. (See further under he and/or she.) Ideally English would have a common gender singular pronoun, one which could refer to either a male or female without identifying their sex. The pronoun it has only limited uses in references to animals and perhaps babies in scientific or impersonal contexts. This explains why they, the common gender plural pronoun, is increasingly being used in singular references (see further under they). \n The quest for expressions which are common in gender or gender-free has also put the spotlight on the so-called epicene words of English, e.g. athlete, patient, writer.

But the English genitive actually covers a number of relationships other than ownership, witness: \n a lawyer’s answer \n the dog’s footprints \n  Thursday’s program \n Japan’s building industry \n Anne’s friend \n The examples show the genitive used to express a variety of more abstract relationships, including inalienable possession, attribution and association, as well as location in time and space. It often provides a neat expression for a wordier paraphrase. Compare the following paraphrases with their genitive equivalents above: \n the answer characteristic of a lawyer \n the footprints left by the dog \n the program set for Thursday \n the building industry in Japan \n a friend of Anne \n (For expressions like a friend of Anne’s, see double genitive.) Genitive phrases headed by a verbal noun are potentially ambiguous. John’s appointment could refer to the person whom John appointed, or to the fact that John himself was appointed. The first meaning with active use of the verb is sometimes called the subjective genitive, and the second where the verb is passive, the objective genitive. The same expression could also mean “an appointment made for John (at the dentist etc.).” The context should clarify which of the three meanings is meant. \n The genitive and the apostrophe \n ∗ With plural nouns, the genitive is usually shown by the apostrophe alone, as in the grammarians’ term. \n ∗ With proper names and words ending in s, both apostrophe s and the apostrophe alone have traditionally been used (see apostrophes section 3). \n ∗ The use of the apostrophe s in expressions like at the hairdresser’s is debatable (see local genitive). \n Note finally that English possessive pronouns do not take apostrophes, in either genitive (or absolute) forms: \n my (mine) your (yours) his her (hers)  its our (ours) their (theirs) \n For the history of its, see further under its or it’s."

Genre so far has almost always been associated with types of artistic creation – with works of literature and art in late C18, and music as well as film and photography in C20. In the visual arts, genre painting has acquired the specific meaning of “art which depicts scenes of everyday life.” \n In reference to writing, the term genre is variously used. At the highest level, it identifies the archetypal forms of composition, such as poetry, drama and novel. But it’s also used to broadly identify the purpose of a work, i.e. as comedy or tragedy, and its substance: fiction or nonfiction. Within any of these categories, genre can identify subgroups, such as biography, essays, letters and journalism within nonfiction; and within, say, journalism the subgroups of news articles, editorials and reviews.

		"explanation":"The writing of geographical names raises several kinds of issues: \n ∗ how to capitalize them \n ∗ how to abbreviate them \n ∗ the choice of anglicized or local forms of foreign placenames \n ∗ variable personal names in placenames \n The variable use of apostrophes in placenames is discussed under apostrophes section 2. For the use of the in names such as The Hague, see the section 4. \n 1 Capitalizing geographical names. Capital letters are used on all the nouns and adjectives that make up a proper geographical name: \n Amazon River Bay of Biscay \n Bering Strait Canary Islands \n Cape of Good Hope Cradle \n Mountain Gobi Desert Great \n Dividing Range Lake Titicaca Mount Cook \n Geographical names like these usually consist of a specific word or words, and a generic word (Bering is specific and Strait generic). In English the order of the components is mostly fixed by convention – except that references to rivers are quite variable. In North America, River is typically the second element (Colorado River, St. Lawrence River) whereas in Britain and Europe it can be the first (River Thames, River Rhine). Though the capital letter might seem to make River an official part of the name, atlas gazetteers and geographical dictionaries (Cambridge World Gazetteer, 1990, Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary, 1997) simply list rivers under their specific element, with no suggestion that there is an official order or form. It therefore becomes an editorial matter: the Chicago Manual (2003) and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) both recommend capitalizing River when it comes after the specific element, and keeping it in lower case when in front: the river Thames/Rhine. These practices can be applied equally to English river names and anglicizations of foreign names. \n When the geographical reference is a descriptive phrase, not a regular name, the generic element is left without a capital: \n  the Canberra lake the Nevada desert \n Note also that the generic component has no capital letter when it appears as an abbreviated, second reference, or when it is pluralized in a phrase which puts two or more geographical names together: Amazon and Orinoco rivers. (See further under capital letters section 1e.) \n 2 Abbreviating geographical names. There are standard abbreviations for the generic parts of geographical names, to be used when space is at a premium (for instance on maps), but not normally in running text: \n C. cape Pen. peninsula \n G. gulf Pt. point \n I. or Is. island R. river \n L. lake Ra. range \n Mt. mount(ain) Str. strait \n American style is to put a stop on all of them, as shown; but it would be omitted from some or all of them in British or Australian style (see abbreviations section 2). \n There are standard abbreviations for whole geographical names, such as: \n  HK NZ UK USA \n Within particular continents, abbreviations are available for individual states or countries, for use in lists and tabular material, or for car registration plates and distribution of mail. Two-letter abbreviations for all 50 American states (and the District of Columbia) are listed in the Chicago Manual, again written without periods / full stops. In Europe such abbreviations are mostly a single letter, as in F for France, D for Germany etc. Those for Canada are set out in Canadian English Usage (1997), and for Australia in the government Style Manual (2002). \n ♦ For the abbreviation of compass points, see abbreviations section 1. \n 3 Foreign placenames – in anglicized or local forms? This is a vexed question in a post-colonial world, when foreign names are no longer preserved in their imperial form. Even in Europe, English-speakers are sometimes surprised to find that “Munich” is Munchen, ¨ and that “Athens” is Athinai to those who live there. Beyond Europe the discrepancies are even more marked, with “Cairo” expressed as Al Qahirah and “Canton” as Guangzhou. Such differences remind us that geographical names are artefacts of different cultures, and those used conventionally in English are a product of history, not always in touch with recent developments in other parts of the world. \n Political developments sometimes force us to accept changes in placenames when “Northern and Southern Rhodesia” marked their independence with the names Zambia and Zimbabwe. In other cases there’s a diplomatic imperative to accept a different form of an old name. Beijing and Sri Lanka are simply local forms of the names we had as “Peking” and “Ceylon,” which recommend themselves for reasons of up-to-dateness, as well as the need to shed the trappings of the colonial era. Yet when using the new names in writing, we may need to remind readers of the older form in parentheses, alongside the new one, at least on first mention. The change of the “Gilbert Islands” into the Kiribati is not self-explanatory (unless you are a phonetician), and many such changes are strategic, e.g. “Burma” to Myanmar. The ultimate reference on all national nomenclature is the United Nations. Newer and older forms of placenames, in English and other languages, are presented in the Getty Thesaurus of Geographical Names, at www.getty.edu. \n 4 Placenames with variable personal names embedded in them. The variable spellings of personal names e.g. Mackenzie/McKenzie, Philip/Phillip, Stuart/Stewart, are another detail to reckon with in placenames (see further under town names). Further references are the geographical dictionaries and gazetteers mentioned above in section 1, and, beyond them, regional authorities such as the US Board on Geographical Names, Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, Australian Geographical Names Board."

		"title": "gerund and gerundive",
		"explanation":"Both these terms come from Latin grammar. In Latin the gerund was a verbal noun, and the gerundive an adjectival future passive participle which carried a sense of obligation or necessity. The English word agenda is a Latin gerundive, meaning literally “[things which] should be done.” \n English grammar has nothing quite like the Latin gerundive. Words formed from verbs with -able (e.g. likable) are as close as we come: they are passive, but do not carry the sense of obligation. There are however equivalents to the gerund, in verbal nouns which end in -ing, as in: \n Singing is my recreation. \n Gerunds in English lead double lives, in that they can behave like nouns or verbs (or both). As nouns, they can be qualified by determiners, adjectives etc., and/or followed by dependent phrases. \n My operatic singing alarmed the dogs next door. \n The singing of grand opera caused a violent reaction. \n English gerunds also have the capacity of verbs to take objects or subjects, adverbs and adverbial phrases: \n Singing grand opera was the problem, or rather, the dogs reacting violently to it. \n Does the gerund require a possessive? The last example – the dogs reacting to it – exemplifies a construction which has long been a bone of contention in English. Some insist that it should be made possessive: the dogs’ reacting to it; and Fowler (1926) argued long and hard that without the possessive marker the construction (which he called the “fused participle”) was “grammatically indefensible.” As with many such issues, it goes back to C18, when the form with the possessive was attacked and defended. According to Webster (in his Dissertations on the English Language, 1789) the possessive alone was “the genuine English idiom.” But Webster’s English Usage (1989) shows that the construction without the possessive has been used for centuries. Database evidence shows that both constructions are current in American, British and Australian English (Collins and Peters, 2003), as they are in Canada (Canadian English Usage, 1997). The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) provides analyses of both constructions to demonstrate their grammaticality. \n In fact the two constructions express slightly different meanings. Compare: \n The dogs reacted to me singing. \n The dogs reacted to my singing. \n The first sentence focuses on the verbal fact that I sang, whereas the second seems to imply that it was my way of singing which caused a reaction (making it a noun). Yet those differences intersect with matters of style. The choice of the possessive my makes the sentence rather formal, while the use of the object pronoun me is acceptable in most everyday kinds of writing. However my or other possessive pronouns still seem to be needed when the gerund is the subject of the sentence, as in My singing alarmed the dogs. The use of me there sounds ungrammatical. But when the gerund is the object, either construction can be used. The Longman Grammar (1999) notes that the second (i.e. verbal) construction is the default."

		"title": "get, got and gotten",
		"explanation":"Get is a common and useful verb, especially in informal spoken English. It is an easy synonym for many others, such as obtain, receive, fetch, buy, take, arrive, become. Apart from these meanings, it has a number of roles as an auxiliary, both in its present form get, and its past got, as follows: \n  Get often works as a substitute for the verb be in passive constructions: \n I’m getting married in the morning. \n Compare I shall be married in the morning, which is much more formal in style, and ambivalent in its perspective. \n  Get is also used as a causative verb in: \n You’re getting your suit cleaned for the occasion. \n I’m getting her to do it. \n Once again, the alternatives are somewhat formal: \n You will have your suit cleaned for the occasion. \n I have prevailed on her to do it. \n As the examples show, get is often used in interactive situations, and is suitable for interactive prose as well as written dialogue. The alternatives are less flexible in style and meaning, and best suited to impersonal and documentary writing. \n 2 Got has an auxiliary role in has got to or have got to, which substitute for must or ought to (see auxiliary verbs section 3). The got to construction is so familiar in speech that the words seem to coalesce, and are sometimes written as gotta. This and other grammatical evidence suggests (Krug, 1998) that gotta is well on its way to becoming a modal verb – except that its strong associations with casual dialogue tend to keep it out of written discourse. There the construction is normally expressed in its full form. \n 3 Got serves as the past tense of get in all parts of the English-speaking world. It is also the one and only past participle for most in middle and southern Britain, and many in Australia. But for Americans and Canadians, Scots and some others, there are two past participles: got and gotten, with separate roles: *got is the only one used when obligation or possession (both material and inalienable) are being expressed, as in \n You’ve got to come. \n  I’ve got a place on the coast. \n He hasn’t got a chance. \n Diseases whether temporary or more permanent (got a cold / got high blood pressure) also combine with got, for English-speakers worldwide. *gotten is commonly found in expressions concerned with changing one’s location or state of being, and with achieving or acquiring something: \n The men had to be gotten out. \n The dream had gotten away from me. \n The waiting room had gotten twice as crowded. \n He had gotten angry. \n They had gotten good results by combining the data. \n She had gotten a new place on the coast. \n Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes a few exceptions, but those represent the dominant patterns of combination. An Australian Style survey in 2002 showed that a majority (over 60%) of respondents under 45 would use gotten when the verb was intransitive (as in gotten angry). The use of gotten outside North America seems to be increasing, and it can be heard further south in England than is generally acknowledged. In BNC data, gotten appears in over 100 citations, including three quoted in the list above. It no doubt helps to discriminate between those various senses mentioned, and is a useful stylistic alternative in idioms such as gotten rid of / gotten wind of, among other examples from the BNC. \n Final note: By all the evidence above, get/got is a versatile verb; and with its numerous roles it is the staple of daily communication. English databases of printed material show that it occurs much more often in fiction than in nonfiction, though there are examples across all 15 genres of British and American parallel corpora (LOB and Brown). It is rarest in the categories of religious, bureaucratic and academic writing – the genres which can least tolerate informality of style. But it has its place in many English idioms and grammatical constructions, and scarcely needs to be rooted out everywhere like a noxious weed."

		"title": "gh",
		"explanation":"This notorious pair of letters represents a bizarre range of sounds in English. At the start of a word, they simply stand for “g,” as in ghost and ghastly. At the end of a word, gh never represents “g,” and has no sound at all in the following sets: \n inveigh neigh sleigh weigh \n high sigh thigh \n bough plough sough \n dough furlough though \n through borough thorough \n In three other sets of words, final gh represents “f ”: \n laugh enough rough \n tough cough trough \n Note that the word slough can be pronounced with “f ” or silently, according to its meaning (see under slay). Given such bewildering possibilities, it’s surprising how few words ending with gh have alternative spellings. Plow has indeed replaced plough in the US and shares the field with it in Canada, but not in the UK or Australia. Thoro is still considered informal, as is thru (see through); and donut is only just recognized as a variant of doughnut. \n The most widely used respelling of gh is in draft, which has taken over from draught in American English, and elsewhere in the world, for some senses of the word (see further under draft).

		"title": "gibe, gybe or jibe",
		"explanation":"These spellings are shared by three different words, meaning: \n 1 “taunt” (noun or verb) \n 2 “sudden shift in the setting of a fore-and-aft sail from one side to the other” (verb or noun) \n 3 “accord” (verb), as in Those numbers don’t jibe with what we’re seeing. The origins of all three are rather obscure. The first may be from French, the second from Dutch, but they have no relatives in English and their spellings were interchanged in earlier centuries. The third appeared from nowhere and made its debut in C19 American English. In a division of labor enshrined in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), gibe was associated with the word “taunt,” gybe with the nautical term, and jibe was the spelling for the third word. \n Usage everywhere now has jibe for the first word as well, and it outnumbers gibe by more than 3:1 in BNC data. The ratio is more like 5:4 in data from CCAE, where the easy gibe complements the retaliatory jibe. The stronger American commitment to gibe for the word “taunt” may be because of the association of jibe with “accord,” as in: \n Few accounts jibe with what she observed. \n The dollar amounts didn’t jibe . . . \n In CCAE, jibe is used much more often as the verb “accord” than as the noun “taunt.” But the American database also shows jibe as an alternative spelling for the nautical term (gybe), of which there’s no sign in the BNC. Jibe is thus the most freely used of these spellings, and if it does service for all three words, the contexts always clarify the meaning. In the collocation jibe at, jibe clearly means “taunt,” whereas jibe with always means “accord (with).” \n In the US, jibe with is very occasionally replaced by jive with, as in an aesthetic that may not jive with an American audience. The word jive comes from Black English, and as noun and verb refers to a type of dance music as well as verbal performance art, known as jive-talk or talking jive. The latter is also a byword for deceptive talk, hence the comment Don’t hand me that jive and the fictional caring but don’t-jive-me probation officer. Several strands of its meaning are there in the man who could jive with dealers in black neighborhoods. The idea of jiving with others suggests accord with them, hence the convergence with jibe in the third sense."

This progress gives the listener or reader a cognitive starting point for whatever is to come. As the discourse proceeds, new information is combined with the old and itself becomes given. \n The process whereby information passes from new to given is signaled in various ways in speech and writing. Common to both is the use of pronouns or other substitute words that maintain a reference, as in: \n Last week I had a day off. It was the best thing I’d done all year. \n The pronoun it in the second sentence marks day off as now given. It effectively backgrounds the item, so that other fresh material can take the stage. Communication would otherwise be choked with cognitively redundant repetition. The move from full to abbreviated references is a similar device to reduce the demands on listener/reader – maintaining the reference while allowing the spotlight to fall on something else: \n . . . joined the National Bank. The bank’s performance impressed him . . . \n While new, the bank is named in full, but once identified the reference can be cut back to the generic element. Its capital letter is often removed (see capital letters section 3), as a further sign of being given rather than new. \n Note that writers can manipulate the presentation of the new, to make it appear to be given.

		"title": "gladiolus",
		"explanation":"This word has too many syllables for a household word, as Fowler (1926) noted, and the English plural gladioluses makes it even longer. This would explain the appeal of the Latin plural gladioli, which is just as common in American English and overwhelms the other in British English, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. Preference for the Latin plural is of course more common for words ending in -us than for other classes of Latin loanwords, as was evident in the 1998–2001 Langscape survey. (See Latin plurals, and compare -us with -a.) \n The need to anglicize this classical word has been felt all along. In earlier centuries it was sometimes gladiole; and nowadays it sometimes appears as gladiola. The latter seems to be a singular, probably derived from the pronunciation of gladiolus interpreted as a plural “gladiolas.” (For other words formed this way, see under false plurals.) Gladiola is listed in Webster’s Third (1986), and its existence is confirmed by a handful of examples in CCAE. The Canadian Oxford (1998) also recognizes it (as “informal”), and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) notes it without comment – perhaps because the more iconoclastic form gladdie is also current in the antipodes. Though first recorded in Morris’s The Township (1947), Barry Humphries no doubt deserves the credit for making it known elsewhere. Neither it nor the clipped form glad would pass in formal contexts."

They’ve gone to the races. \n and \n The clock is still going. If all goes well... \n One part of the verb go (going) also serves with to as a way of expressing future intention: \n We’re going to paint the town red. \n (See further under future.) This very common structure makes (be) going to a kind of auxiliary or modal verb (see auxiliary verbs section 3). A sign that its auxiliary function is well developed is the fact that it can combine with go itself as the main verb: \n They’re going to go to the races. \n Another sign that (be) going to must be counted among the quasi-modals is its assimilated pronunciation in casual speech – rendered by gonna, though it could only appear in scripted dialogue. \n  Go has a place in other English idioms, notably go and, which also hovers on the fringe of being an auxiliary, as a way of expressing inchoative action (see under inchoate): \n Caroline wanted you to go and meet people. \n I decided to go and see one of the Bond films. \n Go and is at home in informal narrative and scripted dialogue, judging by its distribution in the BNC. In American conversational data from the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus, the and is frequently dropped, creating combinations like go see, go get, go look, go do. In its natural contexts go and needs no adapting to “go to,” which makes it too purposeful. Go and can be turned into the past, as in went and saw it (compare try and, which is quite fixed). In the present perfect, it can sound rather deprecating, as in Now you’ve gone and done it. \n The past tense of go (formed with went) is eccentric. It seems to have become standard in C15, when the regular gode (pronounced with one syllable) was perhaps too much like God. Its place was filled by went, annexed from the verb wend, which then revived an earlier regular past wended for its own purposes."

British usage may be changing, as reflected in the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) preference for gobbledygook, whereas New Oxford (1998) goes for gobbledegook. \n Neither spelling can be tied to the word’s origins, which are obscure. It may be imitative of the turkey’s gobble, or simply a nonsense word for wordy nonsense. It associates with pompous officials and professionals who seem less interested in communicating than in overwhelming their readers with long words. Whether their aim is to impress or cover their tracks, what they offer the reader is verbal fog: \n The departmental reaction to the municipal government submission on recreational facilities was instrumental in discouraging philanthropic contributions towards them. \n Decoded, this means (more or less): \n The department was so unhelpful about the council’s proposal for a park that people who might have given money towards it have been put off. \n You can just see it happening!

The boundary between good afternoon and good evening is even more fluid, and is set either by the end of the working day, or the evening meal.

The story begins in C15 with gormandize as an abstract noun which could mean either “epicurean taste” or “gluttony,” and was matched by an identical C16 verb meaning “eat gluttonously.” The verb (pronounced to rhyme with “size”) could also be spelled gourmandize. In C19 gourmandise (rhyming with “cheese”) was (re)borrowed from French for the epicurean noun, along with gourmet for the epicure himself/herself. Derivatives such as gourmandism and gourmanderie added to the set of abstract nouns in which gourmand∼ implied good taste – but contrasted strongly with the negative sense of the verb. Since then, attempts have been made to separate gourmet and gourmand (see next entry), with declining success, and none of the abstract nouns has a secure place in current English.

		"title": "gourmet or gourmand",
		"explanation":"The traditional distinction between these – making gourmet a term of approval for the connoisseur of fine food, and gourmand a negative judgement against someone thought to be a glutton – is increasingly elusive. At bottom both gourmet and gourmand share a preoccupation with food, and the indeterminacy of some references, e.g. soirees ´ peppered with gourmand bishops, leaves some doubt as to which kind of food-lover is intended. Confusion between the two words seems to manifest itself in BNC examples such as the Relais Gourmand Red Shield [award] for an exceptional restaurant – unless the backlash against cuisine minceur makes it a virtue to provide enormous meals. Erratic use of gourmand (e.g. oysters gourmande) goes with its increasing rarity in British and American English. In data from the BNC, it’s outnumbered by gourmet in the ratio of 1:25, and the gap is more like 1:50 in CCAE. \n Gourmet is enjoying increased use as a modifier, in examples such as gourmet food, gourmet dinner, gourmet weekend. This new grammatical role is perhaps confounding the traditional contrast between the two words, predisposing some writers to use gourmet for the adjective and gourmand for the equivalent noun. Yet there are many more examples in BNC and CCAE to show gourmet in its traditional role as noun: the wine-conscious gourmet, the cuisine was a gourmet’s delight – though whether it always carries the traditional sense of culinary discrimination is impossible to know. Writers who wish to target that meaning with the noun would be well advised to employ a synonym such as “epicure.”"

British use of plural agreement with government has been found particularly in reference to the UK administration, whereas singular agreement is applied to foreign administrations (Bauer, 1994). \n Pronouns following government also vary – either it/its or they/them/their. Plural pronouns are in fact quite likely to be used, whatever the verb agreement, in American and British English. This likelihood is enhanced with greater distance between the pronoun and its antecedent, and especially if it extends across a sentence boundary (see Levin, 1998a,b). The pronoun/antecedent relationship is of course not so much one of agreement as reference (see further under agreement and cohesion). \n On the question of when to capitalize government, see capital letters section 3."

		"title": "Governor General and governor-general",
		"explanation":"This is the title of the Queen’s representative, in Canada and Australia. The two forms highlight small differences in usage between them. In Canada the capitalized, spaced form seems to be used officially and more generally, of past and present incumbents. The hyphenated Australian form would be capitalized in references to the present incumbent, but not usually otherwise. Whether capitalized or hyphenated, the plural is officially Governors General/governors-general, because the second part of the word is an adjective, strictly speaking. However many would interpret it as a noun, hence the naturalness of governor-generals (at least in Australia) which enjoys widespread use, and is recognized in the major Australian and American dictionaries. \n In the similar case of major general, the plural is always major generals, whereas for attorney-general, the dictionaries recognize both attorneys-general and attorney-generals, in that order.

In graceful it is an aesthetic grace of form, movement or verbal expression, as in graceful proportions, a graceful leap and a graceful remark. In gracious it’s the grace of sympathetic and respectful human interaction, as in: \n I must decline your gracious offer. \n A graceful compliment could therefore be graciously received, without any sense of tautology. \n Gracious also appears in a handful of fixed collocations, notably your gracious majesty, but also as a traditional courtesy for those at somewhat lower levels in society: your gracious self. These conventionalized uses seem to hang around the relatively recent phrase gracious living (recorded first in the 1930s), where the use of gracious rather than graceful imbues it a certain irony. It has social pretensions, though it can only connote a lifestyle which has a certain aesthetic charm."

With a plural verb it remains a count noun, as it is in Italian (see further under count nouns). The Italian singular form graffito is sometimes used in English, to refer to an individual scribble or message in a mass of graffiti."

		"title": "grammar",
		"explanation":"The deeper secrets of any language lie in its grammar, in the underlying rules and conventions by which words combine with each other. This is especially true of English, where word relationships are only occasionally marked in the forms of the words themselves. Many words can work as nouns, verbs or adjectives without showing it in their outward form: \n in the clear (noun) \n clear the table (verb) \n on a clear day (adjective) \n The grammar of the word, as well as its particular meaning, only emerges in the phrase or clause in which it is used. \n  In other European languages, such as German, French, Italian, Latin, the grammar is much more on the surface of words, hence all the different forms we have to learn for them. Grammarians would note that for those languages, the morphology of words (i.e. their form and their inflections) is vital to understanding the grammar; whereas in English it is the syntax (i.e. the order in which words are combined) which is more important. \n  Regional differences in grammar. In terms of grammatical systems, there are no differences between American and British English. Yet they diverge in many small ways, in the applications of grammatical conventions to particular words and constructions (Algeo, 1988), as documented in individual entries in this book. Divergent applications include the British use of inflected modifiers in compounds and noun phrases such as cookery book, sailing boat, appointments book, departures lounge, ten-years-old boy, 25–44-aged group – where Americans would use the base form of noun or verb (see inflectional extras). Different levels of usage are noteworthy in widespread American use of the mandative subjunctive, where the British tend to use modalized paraphrases with should (see subjunctive section 1). In details of morphology and spelling, American English often prefers the more regular and streamlined conventions (in verb forms such as spelled [see -ed]); and in using English rather than foreign plurals, where British English tends to conserve exotic variants alongside anglicized alternatives: see for example -um. \n 2 “Bad grammar.” In one sense, every native speaker of a language knows its grammar, learning it intuitively as part of the language acquisition process. Still accusations of “bad grammar” may be flung at native speakers who use nonstandard morphology. \n as in: \n n: I kep it in the house. \n Youse had all better be quiet. \n Variant forms like kep and youse often have a long history of spoken use, but are not accepted as part of the standard written language. “Bad grammar” is also sometimes invoked to censure alternative collocations, such as different than (by those who were brought up on different from). An unwillingness to recognize variation in the grammar of English has resulted in a number of fetishes and shibboleths which are still used to identify “correct” and “incorrect” grammar. English grammar is nevertheless somewhat flexible from one context to another, and has certainly changed in its details over the course of time. In principle it embraces more than the current conventions of written language. \n ♦ See further under clauses, parts of speech, phrases, sentences, and syntax."

Though there are English-style plurals, e.g. grand prixs and grand prixes, neither is very satisfactory since prixs is unpronounceable, and prixes adds a foreign syllable to what is still very much a French word.

A Grecian is a scholar of Grecian antiquities. Greek is the older word, dating from C14 and capable of referring to any aspect of Greece, ancient or modern. A Greek is any person of Greek nationality, from Aristotle to Onassis. \n Whether ancient or modern, the language of Greece is always called Greek. Classical Greek was the language of Athens: “Attic Greek.” In C20 two varieties of the language jostled for recognition as the standard: katharevusa (the “high” variety, with spellings that link it with the classical language) and demotike (the popular variety, written much more as it is spoken). Katharevusa was promoted for a while after the Colonels’ coup in 1967, but its role has since diminished with the use of demotike in education, and for most communicative purposes."

		"explanation":"The use of these spellings is now clearly regionalized, with Americans strongly preferring gray, and grey as the standard form in Britain and Australia. Canadians are more inclined to grey than gray (Fee and McAlpine, 1997). \n The choice of spelling for the Oxford Dictionary was apparently in the balance in the 1890s when the chief editor Murray conducted an inquiry to decide the issue. Though The Times was for gray, other printers and a majority of those he asked voted for grey. That settled the issue for him, in spite of the preference given to gray by previous British lexicographers, including Dr. Johnson. \n The regional preferences for grey/gray also determine the choice of spelling for derivatives such as greyish/grayish, greybeard/graybeard and grey matter / gray matter \n Both spellings are enshrined in proper names: compare poet Thomas Gray with tea magnate Earl Grey; Gray’s Anatomy with the Greyhound Bus."

		"title": "griffin, griffon or gryphon",
		"explanation":"Griffin is standard spelling for both a mythical and a real animal: \n 1 the mythical beast with the head and wings of an eagle, and the body of a lion which was believed by the ancient Greeks to keep guard over the gold of the Scythians \n 2 a type of vulture, at home in southern Europe. \n The first item became a feature of the family crests of many noble families in Europe, and a symbol of valor and magnanimity. This dignified role probably helped to generate the alternative spelling gryphon (reflecting its Latin antecedent “gryps”), which was used in heraldry and other contexts where the link with tradition was important. \n Griffon is used in modern English to refer to a breed of wire-haired terrier developed in Belgium in the 1880s. The word is ultimately the French word for “griffin,” though its use may well be ironic. The dog is rather small and its head is more like that of a monkey than an eagle. Another sign of irony is the fact that the French also call it the chien anglais (“English dog”)."

		"title": "grill or grille",
		"explanation":"The grille is one of a number of French loanwords which lost its e as it was assimilated in C17, and reappeared with it in C19. By then it was felt necessary to differentiate the use of the word as “a decorative grating or set of bars over a window or opening” from its use in referring to a style of cooking over a set of metal bars, first recorded in 1766. The two meanings were distinguished this way in French (by means of grille and gril), and their differentiation in English is another sign of frenchification (see further under that heading). The distinction is maintained in both American and British English, with grill used for the kitchen or barbecue, and grille in discussions of architecture and automobiles. Hence both the Gothic Revival grille and the Bentley’s radiator grille. One further step in frenchification manifests itself in the upmarket restaurant that calls itself the Art Gallery Grille."

		"title": "grisly or grizzly",
		"explanation":"Anything which arouses horror in the beholder can be grisly, as in the grisly relics of the concentration camp. Grizzly means “greyish or grey-haired,” so that an elderly person or animal may merit the adjective. \n The grizzly bear may owe its name to both words. In a real sense it is a grisly bear, formidable in size (sometimes 2.5 metres) as is implied in its Latin name Ursus horribilis. However the name could simply be explained by reference to the bear’s color – its fur being anywhere from creamy brown to near-black, but often tipped with white. The animal’s ferocious embrace is the stuff of popular reporting, and it substitutes for grisly in examples from both American and British databases, as in I’ll cut the grizzly ending (not about a bear attack). Allusive references to the grizzly are another symptom of the preoccupation with this animal, turned to good effect in describing a hug that would have done credit to a grizzly. \n In British English, the word grizzly (or grizzling) is sometimes used of a whining child. The word is in no way related to ursine terror, but derived from a colloquial verb grizzle (“whine”). But just which word is involved in a grizzly school trip is a nice question. What exactly did the teachers have to put up with?"

The architectural use of groin to mean “a curve or edge where two vaults intersect,” dating from C18, seems to be a figurative extension of the use in anatomy. \n A groyne is a breakwater designed to reduce the sideways movement of sand on a beach, first mentioned in C16. It seems to be quite independent of the first word, though it too is occasionally spelled groin."

According to this principle, one should say: \n The ground of my decision is this. I need the money. \n rather than: \n The grounds of my decision are this. I need the money. \n But since grounds can just as easily be used to mean “basis” as “particular reason,” its use in the second sentence seems quite idiomatic.

Fowler (1926) noted that guarantee could be used for all senses of guaranty except the rather abstract verbal noun meaning “the act of giving security,” and even that is now possible, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Some dictionaries suggest a distinction based on legal roles: between the guarantee who receives an assurance, and the guaranty (= guarantor) who provides it. But the distinction is confounded by the difficulty of deciding which party merits the label “guarantee” (see further under -ee), and the fact that guarantee is much more common generally, with its everyday and figurative uses as well as legal ones. They are embodied in thousands of citations in the BNC and CCAE, while guaranty has only a sprinkling, and mostly survives in corporate names such as Morgan Guaranty. Guarantee thus lays claim to all the meanings that were ever those of guaranty. \n ♦ Compare warranty."

Yet Webster’s Third (1986) makes it clear that (apart from catalog), they are secondary rather than primary spellings, and data from CCAE shows that most are very rare. Only analog and catalog make a strong showing: with analog outnumbering analogue by 2:1 (see analogue), and catalog on level pegging with catalogue (see catalogue). Webster’s apart, catalog owes its strength to the mail order system, as well as the Library of Congress (see catalogue or catalog). The -gue spellings are in fact French forms of the Greek words, mostly borrowed into English during C16 and C17. This helps to explain why they are established in American English – whereas the frenchified spellings of C19 British English have not taken root in the US (see frenchification). And though -g spellings are accepted alternatives in the US, the shift from -gue to -g has been less rapid than Noah Webster might have wished, when he tried to usher in “tung” for tongue in his dictionary of 1806. \n Note that alternative spellings with -g are only found for words which end in -ogue (not fatigue, intrigue, colleague, or harangue, meringue), and have at least two syllables (not brogue, rogue, vogue)."

The two rs connect guerrilla with its origins in the Spanish word guerra (“war”), of which it’s a diminutive.

American data from CCAE offers strong support for gypsy (which prevails by more than 30:1), whereas the two spellings are much more evenly matched in Britain. In BNC data, gypsy is ahead of gipsy in the ratio of 3:2, though gypsy is built into significant titles such as the National Gypsy Council. As an ethnic name, Gypsy is sometimes spelled with a capital letter in running text, as in the Gypsy minority (in Prague). \n The gypsy spelling was backed by Fowler (1926) on etymological grounds: the word is indeed a clipped form of Egyptian. But the connection with Egypt is mythical: history traces the migrations of these nomadic people into Europe from northern India. The Romany language associated with gypsies is Indo-European rather than Arabic in origin. The spelling gipsy would in fact help to quash the spurious connection with Egypt, and it’s in line with the general trend to prefer i to y spellings where there are alternatives (see further under i/y).

		"title": "h",
		"explanation":"The letter h is the most unstable letter of the alphabet in terms of pronunciation – and diverse in its written uses. Over the centuries it has come and gone from Latin and French loanwords (see a or an). It still slips from common English words such as he, him, his, her and have, has, had, in the stream of conversation. Much of this h-dropping (dropping the h) passes unnoticed when it affects the function words of the utterance (pronouns, auxiliary verbs etc.; see further under words). The chances of it being noticed and censured are much greater when it affects content words: they were all ’ome by then; I felt all ’ot and cold. H-dropping is now generally associated with a shortage of education and strongly deprecated, but it was once fashionable in pronunciations such as “an ’otel.” In North American English h is still dropped from herb and its derivatives: herbal, herbicide etc. English-speakers everywhere omit the h from the middle of words such as shepherd, and proper names such as Clapham. \n The lapsing of h in medieval French prompted Anglo-Norman scribes to use it in medieval English as an auxiliary letter, and it’s the staple of English digraphs such as ch, gh, sh, th, wh (see digraph). It continues to mark the different meanings and pronunciations of pairs such as chat/cat, bus/bush. The pronunciation difference between wh and w (in where/wear etc.) has been contracting in C20 English, especially in southern British English. The change is marked in the Concise Oxford (1995), which shows only the “h”-less form for where, when, which and others. Its impact on Canadian English is registered in the Canadian Oxford (1998). In the US, it’s most evident on the east coast, but further south and west the “h” is still regularly sounded in where, when, which etc., and both pronunciations are indicated in Merriam-Webster (2000)."

		"title": "habeas corpus and sub poena",
		"explanation":"The somewhat obscure Latin formula habeas corpus requires that “you shall produce the person [in court]” (see further under corps, corpse or corpus). Several writs in English law begin with it, and it represents an important civil liberty, obliging anyone who holds a prisoner in custody to bring him or her to court, and state the reasons for their detention. The court then examines the law under which the person is held and decides whether imprisonment is justified or not. The process is designed to prevent people being imprisoned by the state without trial. On occasions it’s also used to prevent a citizen holding another person captive, and to ensure that custody arrangements for the child of divorced parents are properly observed. \n Another Latin phrase which obliges people to appear in court is the sub poena (“under penalty”). Once again it’s the opening phrase of a writ, one which summons the defendant of a case (and those nominated as witnesses) to appear before the judge. As a noun and verb subpoena is set solid, and usually spelled that way in the US as well as the UK. There’s scant evidence of subpena in data from CCAE (despite e being preferred by Americans for other similar words: see oe/e). As a verb, its past form is normally subpoenaed, though a case could be made for subpoena’d (see further under -ed)."

		"title": "haitch or aitch",
		"explanation":"When is a word not a word? Dictionaries do not list haitch as a word, or as a way of representing the sound of the eighth letter of the alphabet (at aitch or H). Though familiar in many varieties of English, “haitch” is frowned upon by those for whom “aitch” is second nature. Its association with Irish dialect / Irish Catholic education would help to explain the censure, as well as its linguistic source. In spoken Irish the letter h is used at the beginning of a word to separate adjacent vowels, and it marks the aspiration of consonants after articles and prepositions. Add to this the ill-founded but pervasive idea that using “haitch” means a lack of education, and it’s clear that social sanctions work against it – as with many a shibboleth (see further under that heading). \n The pronunciation “haitch” has a certain logic to it, since the letter names of most consonants embody their own sound, often beginning with it (“bee,” “cee,” “dee” etc.). And since the “dropping” of h draws criticism (see h), to pronounce it as “haitch” can be seen as exercising extreme care with the name of the letter (see hypercorrection). If and when the social prejudice against it can be overcome, haitch would stand as an alternative to aitch in the dictionaries."

		"explanation":"Nearly a score of different words have clustered under these two spellings. Hale and hail have nine separate entries each in the Oxford Dictionary (1989) as nouns and verbs, not to mention others as adjective/adverb. Not all the words are current and some have always been dialect words, but there are enough in general use to give us pause. Of the two, hail still has more uses, including: \n ∗ “icy precipitation” \n ∗ “greeting” as well as “greet or accost verbally” \n ∗ “come from,” as in He hails from Amsterdam. The surviving uses of hale include: \n ∗ “haul, pull or drag,” as in: They haled him into court. \n ∗ “healthy” as in the phrase hale and hearty. It too was sometimes spelled hail, until C17. This older spelling is enshrined in the Christmas wassail, a drinking toast, literally wes + hail (“[may you] be healthy”). The megaphone with built-in amplifier is a loudhailer in British and Australian English (a bullhorn in American and Canadian). Its use in managing crowd movements might suggest “loudhaler,” but the standard spelling loudhailer makes it simply a device that accosts people noisily."

		"title": "half-",
		"explanation":"This is the first element in numerous compound adjectives and nouns. In British, Australian and Canadian English they are typically hyphenated, though there are variations to note in each group: \n ∗ in adjectives, half- regularly appears with a hyphen, as in: \n half-baked half-cocked half-hearted \n half-size half-timbered \n The chief exception is halfway, which commonly works as adverb as well as adjective, and is therefore set solid. (See hyphens section 2b.) \n ∗ in compound nouns, half- is usually hyphenated, witness: half-boot half-caste \n  half-deck half-hour \n half-life half-light \n half-mast half-pint \n half-sister half-title \n half-truth half-volley \n Just a few have half set solid, notably halfback, halftone, halfwit. Note also that in American English (and to some extent in Canadian) some of the half- compounds are spaced, for example: \n half boot half deck \n half pint half sister \n half title \n The disinclination to use hyphens is typical of American style (see further under hyphens introduction section), although American dictionaries do not always agree on individual words. Everywhere in the world it’s a fluid area of spelling. The good news is that whether half- is hyphened, spaced or set solid, there’s unlikely to be any miscommunication. \n Half- normally combines with Anglo-Saxon words, or with thoroughly assimilated French ones, as in the examples above. Its counterpart in more formal, latinate words is semi- (see further under that heading)."

To British ears, the forms with a half sound less idiomatic, and there’s little evidence of them in the BNC, though a half hour turns up in attributive uses, as in a half hour walk. Other examples such as in bought a half share in Chrysalis Records, or [drill] a half hole in each block are institutionalized cases (because half shares and half holes are standard units like the half pint).

Apart from hallelujah and alleluia it is spelled in a variety of other ways, including alleluya, alleluja, halleluya(h), halleluia, as often happens with loanwords which cannot be decoded by English users. In Latin the word was alleluia, as it was in the earliest English tradition, and it appeared thus in Wyclif ’s translation of the bible (1394), notably in Revelation ch. 19. But in Coverdale’s translation of 1535 hallelujah appeared in a heading to the Psalms of Praise. The legacy of both appears in the Authorized Version of 1611. \n During the next 250 years hallelujah seems to dominate, replacing alleluia in the Revised Standard translation of Revelation. Yet it was increasingly associated with dissenting groups of Protestants such as the Salvation Army, witness the term hallelujah lass. The exclamation Hallelujah! associated with gospel church services contrasts with the formal use of Alleluia for the section of the mass immediately after the gradual. The Catholic tradition retains the spelling alleluia in the New Jerusalem Bible (1985), and it’s also enshrined in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, the English Hymnal and the New English Bible (1961). The preference for alleluia among established churches thus seems to complement the use of hallelujah within the gospel churches.

		"title": "hanged or hung",
		"explanation":"The verb hang still presents two past forms: hanged and hung, after centuries of coexistence. Hanged is the earlier and authentic form for what was once a regular verb. But hung, coined on the analogy of sing/sang/sung in northern English dialects, seems to have spread southward during C16. In conservative domains, hanged continued as the ordinary past tense, hence its use in the Authorized Version of the bible (Ps. 137: . . . hanged our harps upon the willows); and in legal English, whence its association with judicial executions. Death by hanging remains the major application for hanged in British and American English. Two-thirds of the BNC examples refer to judicial or summary executions: \n Malaysia has hanged 90 people under drug trafficking laws. \n Anyone found harboring foreigners in Kuwait would be hanged. \n The construction is much more often passive (like the second example) than active, as in the first. Hanged is also used in ritual killings of other kinds which end in public exhibition of the body, as with the Ku Klux Klan victim beaten to death, then hanged from a tree. Contemporary references to the crucifixion vary between hanged and hung. Compare: \n the Jesus crucified or hanged by the Romans \n . . . [the image of ] Christ hung on the cross \n The death threat or menace of hanging by effigy is expressed as both hanged in effigy and hung in effigy, the latter increasingly likely, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989) and data from CCAE. Webster’s affirms also the tendency of “educated writers and speakers” to use hung in reference to all kinds of execution – a natural consequence of its much greater frequency. Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) found that American news texts were more likely than the British to use hung (as opposed to hanged) for the past tense/participle. But in reference to suicide, hanged himself is still much more frequent than hung himself in both CCAE and the BNC. Whether hanged or hung is used, the construction is rarely ambiguous, because of the accompanying reflexive or the typically passive construction with human subject. Note however the idiom hung jury/parliament – which goes home without reaching a final verdict or decision. \n When what hangs is a material object or the atmosphere, hung is always used for the past form, as in: \n naked bulbs hung from the ceiling \n a map of the Mideast hung on the wall behind \n plumes of smoke hung over the evening sky \n a cool silence hung over the table \n Hung is used everywhere in the numerous idioms associated with hang when it means “linger”:  \n ∗ hang around he hung around the nightclub \n ∗ hang back the family hung back \n ∗ hang in . . . hung in to beat his opponent 6:2, 6:4 \n ∗ hang on they hung on her every word \n ∗ hang out . . . where my pals hung out \n ∗ hang up people get hung up on technicalities \n Note also the use of hang up to mean “terminate,” in reference to telephone calls (he hung up on me), and one’s career (the 72-year-old doctor hung up his stethoscope). That last idiom, and several others listed above (hang in/out, as well as hang on in the sense “persist”) are labeled “informal” by New Oxford (1998). Yet they appear in a range of standard prose styles in the BNC, not including the most formal, so that the label “not formal” would more closely describe their usage. CCAE provides evidence of their use in American newspapers."

		"explanation":"Hard can be either an adjective or an adverb: \n It was a hard hit. (adjective) \n The champion hit hard. (adverb) \n Either way hard implies putting effort into the task. Adverbial use of hard is often associated with verbs of action, and forms compounds with them, as in hard-earned, hard-fought, hard-won, hard-working. In this form hard is a zero adverb (see under that heading). \n Hardly is always an adverb. It no longer carries the sense of the adjective hard, but means “scarcely, almost not,” as in: \n They could hardly see through the smoke. Grammars and usage manuals sometimes refer to it as a negative adverb, although it differs from not in being a relative rather than an absolute negative. Not and hardly contradict each other in very colloquial expressions such as “He can’t hardly walk,” though not as a case of double negative, as is sometimes said. (See further under double negatives.) \n Because hardly expresses a relative degree or state, it is quite often followed by the comparative conjunction than: \n Hardly had they gone than we wished them back again. \n The use of than after hardly was often censured by C20 commentators on usage, taking their cue from Fowler (1926) who amplified a query about it in the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928). The critics argue that a time conjunction (when) is the proper connecter after hardly, even though it would sit awkwardly in the sentence above. Alternatively, they suggest that the comparative element should be explicit, and that hardly should be replaced by “no sooner”:  \n No sooner had they gone than we wished them back again. \n Doubts about the construction hardly . . . than may well have arisen in C19 because both words were developing new roles: hardly as a special kind of negative, and than as a conjunction when there was no explicit comparison (see further under than). The construction may have sounded unidiomatic earlier on. But Fowler himself acknowledged that it was quite common, and by now it’s thoroughly established in ordinary usage. It need raise no eyebrows if it appears in writing. \n Note that the construction scarcely . . . than than has been subject to the same censure as hardly . . . than, with the same suggested alternatives: “no sooner” (for scarcely) and “when” (for than). But there’s no reason to use alternatives if they sit awkwardly or alter the meaning. Scarcely . . . than has been in use almost as long as hardly . . . than."

In contemporary British English the form hark back is standard, dominating the evidence from BNC while the others are virtually absent. In American English all three are used. Data from CCAE shows that hark back is still the most frequent (35 citations), but hearken back and harken back also make some showing (12 and 8 citations respectively).

As a “number sign” or “unit sign” it’s also used in North America and elsewhere to signal an apartment or unit within the block at a particular address. For example: \n Mr. G Michaels \n #3/25 Captain St \n  SUN VALLEY \n This application of hash has something in common with its use in older cartography to mark the site of a village. (There it was called the “octothorp,” literally “8 fields.”) Hash has also been used as the symbol for “pound” in indicating weights, and is sometimes still called the “pound sign” in the US.

	{
		"title": "have",
		"explanation":"This is the second most important verb in English, after be, and like be it is both an auxiliary and a full main verb. \n  As an auxiliary verb the prime function of have is to express the perfect aspect of compound verbs, as in: \n I have waited \n  she has been waiting \n they had waited \n (See further under aspect.) These constructions are used in English everywhere, though database evidence shows that they are more popular in British than American English (Hofland and Johansson, 1982). Americans tend to use a simple past tense (I/she/they waited) when other elements of the sentence (usually time adverbials) can express the aspect. Compare: \n They had waited four hours before seeing a doctor. \n They waited four hours before seeing a doctor. \n The simple past rather than the present perfect is often found with just (see under just or justly). Note also that with yet, auxiliary have is sometimes replaced by be (see under yet). \n Have has other auxiliary or semi-auxiliary functions to express obligation, as in: \n They have to come with us. \n They’ve got to come with us. \n The latter is the more informal of the two constructions. (See further under get section 2.) \n Other quasi-auxiliary roles for have are as a causative verb, and to express management or facilitation of an action or event: \n They’re having our house painted. \n We’ll have them start next week. \n See further under transitive section 1. \n 2 As a main verb have carries the sense of possession or attribution, as in: \n I have a book about it. \n They have the right idea. \n But possessive/attributive statements are often expressed with have got, in American as well as British English: \n I’ve got a book about it. \n They’ve got the right idea. \n Have is then usually contracted, as in these examples. The use of simple have to express possession (once a hallmark of British English) is declining in the UK; meanwhile Americans make more and more use of plain got, according to the Longman Grammar (1999), as in I got a book about it (cf. section 1 above). To British ears this might sound like a recent acquisition, though in American English this would be expressed with gotten: I’ve gotten a book (see get section 3). \n When possessive sentences are made negative and/or into questions, there are several alternatives and some regional preferences, depending on whether the construction involves a definite or indefinite object. \n ∗ With definite objects they are as follows: \n a) I don’t have the book about it. \n Don’t I have the book about it? \n b) I haven’t got the book about it. \n Haven’t I got the book about it? \n c) I haven’t the book about it. \n Haven’t I the book  about it? \n Construction (a) is typical for American English, and (b) for British, at least in conversation. But the British do make some use of (a), according to Longman Grammar research. Construction (c) is rare except in British fiction. \n ∗ Indefinite objects allow the same range of alternatives, but there is greater convergence on the last alternative: \n a) They don’t have any idea. \n Don’t they have any idea? \n b) They haven’t got any idea. \n Haven’t they got any idea? \n c) They haven’t any idea. \n Haven’t they any idea? \n d) They have no idea. \n The Longman Grammar found construction (d) the majority form for the negated indefinite object in both British and American English, and across spoken and written styles. Constructions (a), (b) and (c) are distributed in the same way for indefinites as for definites. \n Final notes: combinations with have \n *have is often redundant when repeated in successive verb phrases, witness: \n I would have liked to have seen the Cook Islands before the cyclone. \n One instance of have seems to have prompted another. In conversation one or both would be contracted (to ’ve), and, in writing, the second one could well be removed. It makes the same point when rephrased as: \n I would have liked to see the Cook Islands before the cyclone. \n *have is usually redundant in the construction had have that expresses impossible conditions: \n If they had’ve realized how hopeless it was, they would never have tried to go on. \n The use of ’ve (for have) is unnecessary, and the sentence reads better without it: \n If they had realized how hopeless it was they would never have tried . . . \n *have is necessary in combinations with modal verbs such as could, may, might, should, would. After them, have is sometimes misheard or misconstrued by naive writers as of, hence “could of,” “might of ” etc., and also the occasional “had of.” The problem is easily identified by computer grammar checkers, or a simple computer search."

		"title": "he and/or she",
		"explanation":"The third person singular pronouns he and she are one of the few points in English grammar that make us gender-conscious. We are forced to choose between them for any reference to a single human being, and the choice (whether it is he or she) seems to exclude half the population. Try filling the blank in the following sentence: \n Every teacher must ensure that . . . can do first aid. \n Whether you put he or she, you seem to imply that teachers are all of the same gender. The same problem affects his/her and him/her. \n On arrival at the hotel, the tourist is expected to surrender . . . passport. \n Here again, the choice of his or her begins to create a gender-specific identikit of the tourist. \n gender-specific identikit of the tourist. In earlier centuries, before the general concern about sexism in language, it was assumed and accepted that he/his/him could be both masculine and common in gender (see gender). Common gender uses of the pronoun are still to be found in aphorisms, and in quotations from the King James bible: \n He who hesitates is lost. \n He that shall humble himself shall be exalted. \n Such statements make generic use of he to refer to every human being, and would be seriously compromised if they applied only to the male half of the human race. Some would argue that the use of he/his is also generic in: \n The applicant must demonstrate his ability to work independently, and how he would develop the unit if appointed. \n However for many people, this use of he/his suggests that women are ineligible for the job. Thus in ordinary usage he/his/him seems to be losing its capacity to be generic. \n Alternatives to “generic” he: \n 1 he or she: how he or she would develop the unit. This spells out the fact that both sexes are in the mind of the person communicating, and that no discrimination is intended. Once or twice in a text it’s alright, but cumbersome if used repeatedly. In current British and American English, he or she is nevertheless strongly favored over options 2 and 3 (in the ratio of 5:1 in both BNC and CCAE). \n 2 he/she: how he/she would develop the unit. Both sexes are recognized as in point 1. The stroke puts the alternatives more neatly, in keeping with its regular role (see solidus). It has straightforward counterparts in his/her and him/her. \n 3 s/he. This again is a neat way of showing that both sexes are included, and actually foregrounds the female alternative. It offers no alternative for his/her, him/her, at which point the male alternative is again foregrounded. But if the subject pronoun is the only one needed, s/he works well. \n 4 he alternating with she throughout the text. This is suggested by some as a way of being absolutely even-handed, but it is extremely disconcerting to the reader. The constant switching of gender gives the impression that two different identities are being referred to, when only one generic individual is intended. \n 5 it. An outsider can use it and its to refer to a baby, though the child’s parents are unlikely to do so. The pronoun cannot be used very far up the age range. \n 6 they. This works very well if you turn the whole sentence into the plural: \n Applicants must indicate how they would develop the unit. \n Nowadays they and them/their are used increasingly in writing after a singular human referent – as has long happened in speech. To some this is still a grammatical error; but to many it comes reasonably enough, at least after an indefinite word: \n Anyone who applies must indicate how they would develop the unit. \n Using they (them/their) after a more specific singular word is more contentious, and may sound awkward or ungrammatical: \n The applicant must indicate how they would develop the unit independently. \n (See further under they.) \n 7 you. In some situations, the indefinite you can be substituted. But when repeated, it creates a style which seems to address the reader directly (like the regular pronoun): \n When applying you must indicate how you would develop the unit. \n (See you and ye special uses 1.) \n 8 Avoid pronouns altogether and rely on abstract nouns: \n The applicant must demonstrate an ability to work independently, and present plans for the development of the unit. \n This style is impersonal and detached rather than friendly. (See further under abstract noun and person.) \n 9 Repeat the words which identify people in terms of their roles, provided this is not too clumsy. The word applicant could hardly be repeated within our illustrative sentence, but in successive sentences it can be effective: \n The applicant must demonstrate an ability to work independently. The applicant’s plans for the development of the unit should also be submitted. \n With so many alternatives available within English, there’s really no need to invent a new common gender pronoun to replace he and she. For some however, that’s the only way to cut loose from the sexist traditions embedded in English. Among their various proposals are items such as Co, E, hesh, tey, ther, thon: see Baron (1986) for scores of others invented since about 1850. Unfortunately most of them require some explanation, and concerted effort to implement them. The most instantly accessible of all such creations is s/he, which has been used from time to time in this book."

See for example: \n . . . the appointment of John Trevelyan to head up the BBFC \n Coady will head up the new literary group. \n . . . picking their friends to head up privatised national industries \n These and other examples from the BNC show the naturalization of the construction in British English, especially business and sports reporting.

		"title": "heading, headline, header and head",
		"explanation":"These words all refer to a cue provided for the reader at the start of an item, though they belong to different kinds of documents. Headings are a regular feature of nonfiction publications such as textbooks and government reports, where they cue the reader as to the subject about to be discussed. Typically a phrase, the heading is set apart by typographic means at the top of a chapter or section. (See next entry for the setting of headings and subheadings.) \n Headlines are the telescoped sentences set in larger, heavier type above newspaper articles, to grab the reader’s attention. Some aspects of their wording are distinctive (see headline language). \n In computer software the term header refers to a wordprocessing facility which places selected items at the top of every page of a document – especially the page number and running head, i.e. abbreviated chapter or section title."

		"title": "headings and subheadings",
		"explanation":"In many kinds of nonfiction headings are a boon to readers, in signaling the structure of information in the solid text below, and helping them over the potential problem of not being able to “see the wood for trees.” For the writer too, deciding on headings and subheadings is an important step in getting on top of the material, and being able to present it in manageable blocks. Choosing headings also obliges you to think about the order of the blocks – which may come easily if there’s a conventional set such as primary/secondary/tertiary (as in education or industry). In more open fields writers have to invent their own series of headings, making sure that individually they are suitable for everything under them. \n The headings correlate with the major structural divisions of any piece of writing. For example (for an essay on the flute): \n A Uses of the flute \n B The European concert flute \n C Music composed for the flute \n Within each structural block subheadings must be found to label smaller units of discussion, and link up with the major headings. Sometimes the main heading may need rewording, to enlarge its scope or to make it more specific: \n A HISTORICAL USES OF THE FLUTE \n A 1. Herdsman’s pipes in the Mediterranean, and in South America \n A 2. As an aid to courtship in mythology and literature \n A 3. As a professional musician’s instrument in ancient Egypt and in medieval Europe \n Layout and typography of headings. In a table of contents, headings and subheadings would be set out as just shown, with subheadings indented from the main headings. Subsubheadings would be further indented. To enumerate them, a combination of letters and numbers (as above), or just numbers may be used. (See numbers and number style section 6.) \n Both in the table of contents, and on the ordinary page, headings are distinguished from subheadings by means of different fonts. So main headings may be in bold, and others in normal type, or the main heading in caps., and the others using only an initial cap. Most wordprocessors allow you to vary the type size to distinguish the levels of heading, e.g. 12 point for headings and the regular 10 point for subheadings. Small caps. and italics, if available, serve as further typographic variables to show lower-level headings. Letter spacing is also a resource for differentiating the levels of heading. CompareUSES with USES.  \n With or without flexible typographical resources, the placement of headings and subheadings on the printed page can be used to distinguish one from another. Main headings may be centred, while subheadings are flush with the left margin. Additional line space below main headings also helps to mark the difference. The first line of text after a heading or subheading is often set flush with the left margin. But some publishers simply indent it like any other paragraph."

Each is illustrated in turn below: \n BOND TELLS OF MEETING WITH SPY \n BULGARIAN LEADERS QUIT, PLEDGE REFORM \n COOK MANUSCRIPT STOLEN \n OFFICIAL: MANDELA CLOSE TO FREEDOM \n As the examples show, verbs are a feature of many headlines, helping to highlight what is happening. They may be finite verbs (quit, pledge), participles with the verb be omitted (stolen), or verbal nouns (meeting). Certain short verbs / verbal nouns are regulars in headlines, including: \n aid axe ban bar bid call \n clash crash curb cut find flee \n leak pact probe push quite rise \n seek slam slash wed win \n Words like these suggest decisive action, though they are often matters under discussion which will take time to be acted on.

		"explanation":"In both American and British English, heaps of serves as a rather vague quantifier of both tangible and intangible things: \n heaps of freshly caught stone crabs \n heaps of money, oil, gas and other resources \n heaps of atmosphere \n heaps of line-out possession \n As these examples show, the expression becomes informal the more it’s associated with intangible objects, which could not conceivably lie around in piles. Its meaning is equivalent to lots of. The same is true of a heap of, witness: \n a heap of twisted metal \n a heap of laughter \n a heap of anecdotal evidence \n a heap of trouble \n Again in ranging from tangible to intangible, a heap of becomes progressively more informal, the meaning diluted to the point where it’s simply a paraphrase for a lot of. Expressions at that end of the scale are probably commoner in the US, but they appear also in the UK, by the sprinkling of examples in the BNC.

Compare: \n A lone bird hove in sight. \n It was 16 days before the old fort hove into view. \n The antecedents of heaved and hove were among the many variants of the past tense of heave in Old English, giving it both regular and irregular forms which were in general use for centuries.

		"title": "hedge words",
		"explanation":"One quick way to soften the impact of a statement is to insert a hedge word. There are four subtypes, according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985), which presents them under the general heading of downtoners: \n ∗ approximators e.g. almost, nearly \n ∗ compromisers e.g. rather, quite (in British English) \n ∗ diminishers (a) e.g. partly, somewhat (these modify the force of the following expression) \n (b) e.g. only, merely (these confine the reader’s attention to a single item) \n ∗ minimizers e.g. barely, hardly \n These hedge words are all from standard English, and there are comparable adverbial expressions in colloquial English: practically (approximator); kind of (compromiser); just (diminisher); a bit (minimizer), as used in negative statements such as He didn’t like it a bit. Note that in positive statements, a bit is a diminisher: I was a bit hasty. Those examples also show the different positions in which some downtoners may appear. Others have a fixed position, e.g. enough, which always follows the word it modifies. Compare: \n It was rather good. \n  It was good enough. \n Hedge words curb the assertiveness of a claim, and prevent a style from sounding too arrogant. They put limits on statements which could not be defended in their absolute form. Yet like any stylistic device they offer diminishing returns and become conspicuous (and ineffective) if overused. Even if you “juggle” several of them in the same piece of writing, they eventually draw attention to themselves because they create repetitive phrase patterns. Other strategies are needed, especially ones which help to vary the patterns. Modal verbs such as can, could, may, might, should, would help on both fronts, but again must be used sparingly (see further under modality). Modal adverbs such as possibly, probably, and clausal paraphrases such as it is possible/probable/likely that ... provide other ways of hedging a statement. Best of all is to find lexical paraphrases, replacing “rather good results” with promising results etc., to extend the verbal range. \n ♦ Compare intensifiers."

		"title": "Hegira, hegira or hejira",
		"explanation":"This Arabic word for “emigration, flight” has great significance for the Islamic faith, standing for the flight of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. When used in reference to that event, or the calendar based on it, Hegira is normally capitalized: \n The coin bears the Christian date 1987 and the Hegira date 1408. \n (See further under dating systems.) \n When hegira refers to any individual’s emigration, flight or journey – actual or figurative – it appears with lower case: \n . . . sets forth on a dizzying hegira that ends in Hamburg \n . . . takes the reader on an intellectually strenuous hegira through four different languages \n The spelling hejira occasionally substitutes for hegira in any of its senses, as in: the band’s hejira towards the mainstream. \n Neither spelling renders the Arabic hijrah exactly, though hejira embodies the more authentic consonant.

The Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes “the obscurity of the first syllable,” and gives priority to hallo, apparently because the word is seen as a variant of halloa and halloo. Dictionaries in North America and Australia prefer hello, and it’s the most frequent spelling by far in American, British and Australian databases. Americans hardly make any use of either hallo or hullo, whereas the British maintain a lowish level of both as alternatives."

		"title": "help (to)",
		"explanation":"The verb help couples readily with other verbs as bare infinitives or in their to-forms. Compare: \n A geometric effect was chosen to help break up the space. \n Back-row moves would help to break up the pattern of play. \n The choice between the two constructions depends on a number of linguistic factors, one of which is whether help is itself preceded by to, as in the first of these sentences. The Longman Grammar (1999) found that with a preceding to, the bare infinitive was very strongly preferred in all genres of writing. It was also the preferred construction whenever there was an intervening noun (phrase), as in help people break the cycle of poverty. These two grammatical factors make help plus bare infinitive the commoner construction of the two by far in everyday spoken and written English, in both the US and the UK. In British English this represents a shift from earlier preference for help plus to-infinitive (Mair, 1998). The relatively high proportion (45%) of help to constructions found in British academic prose are a sign of its conservatism."

		"title": "hem-/haem-",
		"explanation":"This element of ancient Greek, meaning “blood,” has been put to use in modern scientific words, especially in medicine and physiology. Some familiar examples are: \n h(a)emoglobin h(a)emophilia \n h(a)emorrhage h(a)emorrhoid \n It also appears as -(a)em- when not the first syllable of a word. See for example: \n an(a)emia hypoglyc(a)emia \n  leuk(a)emia septic(a)emia \n tox(a)emia \n British spelling has traditionally preferred haemoglobin, anaemia etc. where American and Canadian English uses hemoglobin, anemia. In Australia, both spellings are in use for the more familiar words in each set, and major newspapers present hemorrhage and leukemia while the medical profession is still committed to haemorrhage and leukaemia. Yet American doctors lose nothing of substance in preferring hem- and -em-, and some unnecessary clutter is shed from the spelling. (See further under ae/e.) The -em spelling makes for better spelling/sound regularity in words such as hypoglycemia, septicemia, given the general convention that a c followed by a would be a hard “k” sound. (See further under -ce/-ge.) \n Some h(a)em- words are specialized terms in geology and chemistry, including h(a)ematite and h(a)emat(e)in. Once again their standard spelling in Britain is with haem-, but in North America it’s hem-, and they are recognized in that form in Australia. The connection with “blood” in such words is remote – which deflates the argument that haem- is a more meaningful spelling. \n The spelling of the syllable following h(a)em- is sometimes in doubt, as to whether it should be a or o. In most cases it is o: h(a)emoglobin, h(a)emophilia etc. The chief exceptions are those like h(a)ematite and h(a)ematology, where the basic element is the combining form h(a)emat-, not h(a)em-. \n International English selection: The spellings with hem- and -em- are preferable. They are more widely used, and integrate better with the conventions of English spelling, in terms of vowel and consonant–vowel sequences."

		"explanation":"In abstract argument hence, i.e. “from this point,” is still a useful word for introducing a conclusion, an alternative to therefore, thus etc. There it serves as an adverbial conjunct between two sentences (see further under conjunctions section 3). But other uses of hence in the realms of space (“from this place, from here”) and time (“from this time, from now”) are very much reduced now. As a time adverb, hence is mostly confined to fixed phrases such as: two weeks hence, six months hence. When used in references to place, e.g. go (hence) to Singapore, it now sounds quite old-fashioned. \n  The sense of place was once fundamental to hence, and it contrasted with hither and here, as in: \n Get thee hence! (from this place) \n Come hither! (to this place) \n I am here! (in this place) \n In spite of those neat distinctions, the system seems to have broken down for hence/hither/here – just as it has for thence/thither/there and whence/whither/where. In each set the third word is the strongest survivor in everyday English. The others have restricted uses, and otherwise seem formal, old-fashioned or archaic. The status of hence, thence and whence seems in fact to have been insecure for centuries. To write from hence is strictly redundant (because “from” is part of the meaning of hence itself), yet it’s on record from C14 on. The King James bible (1611) has numerous instances of from thence/whence, including the famous line of Psalm 121: “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.” Hence/thence/whence linger only as rhetorical variants for here/there/where in reference to place."

A person’s heritage is broader and more abstract, often referring to the accumulated culture and traditions which belong to a nation and are the birthright of all its citizens. However the architectural heritage of the countryside can too easily become the heritage industry, where in BNC citations tourists queue to buy heritage over the counter, and cynicism abounds: this heritage stuff about happy agricultural labourers with straws in their mouths. \n Yet the notion of heritage can surmount national boundaries, as in: . . .  \n Hitler’s jack-booted thugs heaping the heritage of the world onto a pyre and gloating as the flames consumed book after book . . . \n In current usage heritage often refers to natural resources which must be carefully preserved for posterity and for humanity as a whole, as in concerns about listing Scotland’s Flow country under the World Heritage Convention, and the already betrayed heritage of wild flowers and healthy trees."

		"title": "heterogeneous or heterogenous",

Examples like these emerge in both American and British English, though the evidence of databases (CCAE and the BNC) is that they are not very frequent. The use of heterogenous for heterogeneous may well be more often heard than seen, because it facilitates pronunciation of what is otherwise a six-syllabled word with compound stress. Webster’s Third (1986) simply registers heterogenous as an alternative form,whereas the Oxford Dictionary (1989) dubs it a “less correct” form of heterogeneous. There is perhaps potential ambiguity in referring to a heterogenous electorate: could it mean that some voters come in from over the electoral border?

Whatever the term, they are the opposite of homophones (which sound the same), while being homographs (written the same way): see further under homonyms. \n The term heteronymy is used differently by others, for alternative words from different origins that refer to the same item: thus sneakers, plimsoles, gym shoes, trainers are heteronyms for a certain type of soft shoe.

It sometimes appears in full verb phrases: timber that is being hewed down with an ax. For all this, hewn is still much more common in all the constructions mentioned. \n In both varieties hewed serves as the simple past tense meaning “cut down.” But Americans and Canadians also make figurative use of the verb in the construction hewed to, used of stances and political alignments adopted: \n The court has never hewed strictly to a conservative line. \n . . . suspicion that it [the proposal] hewed too closely to Soviet aims \n  The idiom suggests active conformity to some preexisting policy, rather than chipping away at the frontier."

To spell them out as high-fi and high-tech seems rather reactionary if you are going to use them, and hi-fi has ousted its rival, by the evidence of American and British databases. But hi-tech still shares the field with high-tech, in the ratio of 2:3 in BNC citations, and is the minor player in data from CCAE, where the ratio is 1:6. Hi-rise appears in real estate / property advertising, but not in the discursive texts of the American and British databases. \n The origins of both hijack and hifalutin are obscure, and the alternative spellings highjack/highfalutin show folk etymology at work, trying to inject meaning into the first syllable. But Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) both prefer hijack, and Oxford citations for highjack are from back in the 1920s and 30s. Current data from British and American databases is overwhelmingly with hijack. The spelling of hi(gh)falutin is apparently going the opposite way: there are 5 of highfalutin to 1 of hifalutin among BNC citations, and in CCAE the ratio is more than 15:1.

The word is applied to making a payment for the temporary loan of objects such as boats, caravans, halls and dinner jackets. The fact that such loans are short-term helps it to contrast with rent, the verb used for securing a fixed-period tenancy of business or private accommodation by means of regular payments. The word lease is usually applied to longer-term arrangements for business premises or land, and usually implies a formal contract. So hire, rent and lease can be distinguished in terms of the kind of property involved, length of the loan period, and style of payment. \n The distinctions between the words are nevertheless increasingly blurred.

Since the 1970s it has also served as a noun (a young Hispanic), according to Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations, though such usages were no doubt established earlier in American English. In the US, Hispanic populations are concentrated in different parts of the country: the so-called Chicanos in southwestern and western states (especially New Mexico and California), Cubans in the southeast (Florida) and Puerto Ricans in the northeast (especially New York). Hispanics are not uncommonly mentioned in the same sentence as other disadvantaged groups – which explains why the word sometimes appears without a capital, if that goes for the other group(s) mentioned: \n Four homeboys – two black, two hispanic – quit the Bronx for a night in Manhattan. \n As a straight ethnic designation, Hispanic is normally capitalized: . . . 12 jurors, 10 white, one Hispanic, one Asian-American . . . in keeping with the use of initial capitals in ethnic names (see capital letters section 1). \n While the term Hispanic is neutral, its various abbreviations including spic, spick, spik and Spic are derogatory (see under racist language). \n ♦ Compare Chicano and Latino."

		"title": "historic or historical",
		"explanation":"The distinction between these two is sharper than for many -ic/-ical pairs. Historic is more self-consciously associated with the making of history, so that a historic event is one which people feel is particularly significant in the life and culture of the nation. Historical is more neutral, acknowledging that something belongs to the past, or to the study of the past, or else that it really happened and is not fictitious. \n Note that histrionic is not related to history but derived from histrio (“actor”), hence its connotations of “melodramatic, artificial” and the implied contrast with “sincere.” \n ♦ For the question as to whether to write an before historic and historical, see a or an."

		"title": "hoard or horde",
		"explanation":"These words are easily mistaken for each other with their identical sound and similarity in meanings. Both can refer to large masses. Yet while a hoard is a collection of inanimate objects stored away, as in a hoard of old tools, horde refers to a large body of people or animals, as in a horde of kids, or horde of mosquitoes. Horde often implies some discomfort or threat associated with that group, although in colloquial usage it just means “a large number,” as in: golden hordes of tourists. This rather figurative use is the point at which the line between horde and hoard becomes harder to draw. \n becomes harder to draw. Confusion between the two words has been commented on by usage guides since the 1980s. Ready examples from the databases are hoards of children / speculators / autograph hounds / gadget-mad consumers; and in fact 50% of the instances of hoards in CCAE refer to groups of people, and more than 30% in the BNC. About half the BNC citations are from transcribed spoken material, but the others come from published texts that would have had editorial scrutiny. Curiously, the confusion seems to work only in one direction: there’s no evidence of hordes being used where hoards might be expected. Webster’s English Usage (1989) suggests that hoards is somehow the more familiar spelling, yet hordes is actually more frequent – almost twice as frequent in both BNC and CCAE. Hoard is perhaps more English-looking with its oa digraph, and it does in fact go back to Old English, whereas horde with its seemingly redundant e is a C16 loanword from Turkish via Polish. Whatever the incentives for using hoard for horde, it gets no support from the major dictionaries."

		"title": "hobo",
		"explanation":"This word for a vagrant or itinerant worker originated on the western side of the US in late C19, though its etymology (with perhaps Spanish or American Indian roots) is obscure. It enjoyed some vogue in the earlier C20, with the creation of derivatives such as hoboette and hobohemia, and also spawned a verb, as in he hoboed to the west coast. For Americans, the hobo was a familar image of the 1930s depression, and their mode of travel – “hopping freights” (i.e. freeloading on freight trains to go anywhere) – became proverbial. Movies, novels and the latter-day yuppie hobo perpetuate the lifestyle. In the plural, the word is usually hobos, by the evidence of CCAE, though Merriam-Webster (2000) puts hoboes first. In the UK there’s little to go on for the plural (1 instance each way in the BNC), but again hoboes is put first in New Oxford (1998)."

		"title": "holistic or wholistic, holism or wholism",
		"explanation":"Holistic is closely related in meaning to the English word whole, but takes its spelling directly from the Greek element hol(o)- (“whole, entire”). It was in fact coined by General Jan Smuts in the 1920s as a philosophical term, and now appears in other academic fields as a synonym for “global.” The underlying link with whole has naturally helped to generate the spellings with wh, which are recognized in the major dictionaries – British, American, Australian and Canadian (for wholism). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) offers multiple citations of wholistic as well as wholism; and it treats them as “alterations” of holistic and holism, with no hint of censure. Current usage however is strongly in favor of holistic, in database evidence from the BNC and CCAE."

		"title": "Holland and Dutch",
		"explanation":"English treatment of the Dutch is a bit casual – at least in the way that the English language refers to them. Holland has been used by the English for the homeland of the Dutch people since C17, though it is actually the name of two of the twelve provinces (Noord Holland, Zuid Holland), and home to just 40% of the Dutch population. The official international name for the country is The Netherlands, which serves also as adjective, as in the Netherlands ambassador to the UN. (See under Netherlands for the history of that name.) Yet the term Holland persists in English usage, and is still used a good deal more than (The) Netherlands in the US, and about as much in the UK, according to database evidence. \n  The adjective Dutch was coined by English-speakers out of deutsch (the German word for “German”). Again it seems rather an approximation, despite the fact that the language and people of the Netherlands are Germanic in origin. The term “Pennsylvania Dutch,” referring to the US community descended from early German settlers, preserves the older sense of the word. \n Negative English attitudes seem to hang around the use of the word Dutch/dutch, in various none-too-flattering phrases such as dutch courage, dutch treat. Since those expressions owe more to English prejudice than any demonstrable customs of the Dutch, there’s no reason to use a capital letter in them – though old writing habits die hard. Webster’s Third (1986) notes that the capital is more likely to be used for the first expression than for the second, but the solitary example in CCAE is for dutch treat. Other examples such as Dutch Treat: bicycling holidays in Amsterdam may be either a play on the idiom or a reinterpretation of it which implies that it’s dying a natural death. See further at capital letters section 2, and throwaway terms."

		"title": "home in on or hone in on",

More figuratively, it’s used of narrowing the focus of an inquiry or discussion, as in: \n Several unions homed in on “non-standard” workers. \n The relatively uncommon verb hone (“sharpen”) is sometimes used by mistake in that phrase. Hone can be used either literally (of sharpening a blade), or figuratively as in honing his argument, i.e. making it more pointed. In this sense it begins to overlap with figurative use of the verb home, and may be heard to replace it in hone in on. Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes that hone in on seems to be on the increase, though there’s little evidence of it in CCAE or the BNC – except in transcribed speech."

		"title": "homely, homey, homy or homie",
		"explanation":"Homely, originating in C14, meant “homelike,” as it still can when applied to a setting or style of living. In such applications it has positive value, so that a homely way of entertaining would connote a lack of pretentiousness and artifice. But when applied to people and their appearance it becomes more ambivalent. In Britain, the phrase homely girl may still imply recognition of her practical and domestic skills, whereas in North America it’s distinctly unflattering and means she is plain or unattractive. \n Hom(e)y, coined in C19, is free of such ambiguity and simply connotes all the familiar and comfortable aspects of home life, as in: \n The food is decent, homey stuff \n Her homey Lancashire friendliness made everyone love her \n The spelling homey is strongly preferred, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. Yet homy is given preference in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and is more regular in terms of the rules for final -e (see -y/-ey). \n In the US and Australia, homie is a colloquial abbreviation of “homeboy,” i.e. person from one’s home town or neighborhood, and by extension a “member of a neighborhood gang.”"

		"title": "homeopath and homoeopath, hom(o)eopathy and hom(o)eopathist",

In the Langscape survey of 1998–2001, a majority of respondents everywhere preferred homeopathy. Among Americans the vote was 100%, and 70% even among the British. New Oxford (1998) comes out in favor of homeopathy and homeopath. Fewer and fewer people find any value in preserving the classical oe digraph, used to represent a Greek diphthong in such words. The spelling homeois sufficient to distinguish them from homo- (see further under that heading). With its odd sequence of vowels, homoeopath(y) defies all the spelling conventions of English, and obscures its own pronunciation.  \n When it comes to choosing between hom(o)eopath and hom(o)eopathist, usage everywhere supports the shorter form. Both Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998) endorse homeopath, and it’s the only spelling to be found in CCAE. In British usage as represented in the BNC, hom(o)eopath outnumbers hom(o)eopathist in the ratio of 4:1. Though both spellings (printed with oe) appear as full headwords in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), New Oxford concentrates attention on homeopath, and homeopathist is listed only as a run-on (see ligatures). \n International English selection: The spelling homeopath has the weight of usage behind it, even in Britain, and conforms better to the conventions of English spelling."

		"title": "Homo sapiens",
		"explanation":"This neo-Latin phrase identifies the fully evolved human being, with intellectual powers not shared by animal species. Literally it means “rational human,” though the words appear in reverse order, as is usual in scientific nomenclature. Homo sapiens contrasts with earlier human species such as Homo erectus (“upright man”: not stooping like a gorilla), and Homo habilis (“skilful man”: able to make tools), now postulated as previous stages in human evolution. The initial capital letter conforms to the scientific convention of upper-casing the genus name and lower-casing the species name (see scientific names). The initial capital is sometimes dropped (homo sapiens) when the expression is used nontechnically as a paraphrase of “human being” or “human kind.” For example: \n The biggest threat to both wolf and caribou is homo sapiens. \n Its familiarity in American English is evident in the fact that over a third of all examples in CCAE were lower-cased. But the BNC has too few examples of the phrase to show this effect in British English. \n Other variants of Homo sapiens are ad hoc creations by philosophers of humanity: homo loquens (“speaking man”: one who has the power of speech), and homo ludens (“playful man”: the irrepressible joker). \n Note that in colloquial usage, homo is a derogatory abbreviation for homosexual (see further under homo-)."

		"explanation":"These two have had distinct applications, with homogeneous used anywhere to mean “made up of the same kind of elements,” and homogenous by biologists to mean “of similar structure and/or origin.” Amid the difficulty of keeping them apart, biologists have turned to homologous (for structure) and homogenetic (for origins), and so homogenous is free to roam. The convergence of homogenous with homogeneous has perhaps been helped by the spelling (and pronunciation) of homogenize, which means “make homogeneous.” The interplay of the two words is recognized by crossreferencing in all major dictionaries – British, American, Canadian and Australian, though New Oxford (1998) and the Canadian Oxford (1998) still question the correctness of using homogenous for homogeneous. British/American divergence seems to emerge in the relative frequencies of the two spellings: homogeneous is 12 times more frequent than homogenous in BNC data, but only 3 times more frequent in CCAE."

		"title": "homonyms",
		"explanation":"Words that are alike in form are homonyms. They may be alike in sound (homophones), such as bail and bale or gibe, gybe and jibe. Or they may be identical in their written form (homographs), such as bear (“carry”) and bear (“large furry animal”), or refuse (“say no to”) and refuse (“rubbish”). As the latter examples show, homographs may or may not be identical in sound. The point is that, although their spelling is identical, they are independent words by virtue of their separate etymologies. (Compare polysemy.) \n English is well endowed with homonyms, partly because of its many one-syllabled words: I, eye and aye. But there are also plenty of examples with two or more syllables, such as cellar/seller, gorilla/guerrilla, principal/principle, holy/holey/wholly. Further homonyms are created when ordinary suffixes are added to words, as in allowed/aloud or presents/presence. \n The quantity of homonyms in English is sometimes seen as a problem. Scholars in early modern English actually encouraged the use of distinct spellings for homophones, as visual reminders of their different meanings. To such efforts we owe the spellings discreet v. discrete, flour v. flower, among others which are maintained everywhere. But the same principle is embodied in others like check/cheque, curb/kerb, found only in British English. The different spellings are a two-edged sword: they help the reader, but they impose a heavier burden on the writer to know which goes with which meaning. When surrounding words help to settle the meaning, it seems rather unnecessary to insist on differentiated spellings. American writers who use fewer of them have no obvious difficulties in communicating. \n The coincidence of homonyms or homonymic clash has sometimes seen the extinction of one of the two terms. The Old English word neat meaning “ox” has disappeared from modern English under pressure from the French-derived adjective neat. A small trace of the lost homonym can be found in neat’s foot oil. Homonyms that are subject to some kind of taboo may impact negatively on the other, hence the replacement of ass by the Spanish-derived burro in American English, presumably because of the clash with American pronunciation of arse."

That phrase also appears in a score of American examples in CCAE, and is occasionally paraphrased by top honcho or chief honcho. But honcho is also modified in other ways, as in network honcho, brand-new Columbia honcho, behind-the-scenes honcho, a crooked, snorting honcho, and thus provides a matrix for relevant information. There’s further evidence of its productivity in honchoette; and Garner (1998) illustrates its use as a verb (honchoed, honchoing) where it means “champion a cause.” For the moment it’s strongly associated with journalism, and whether the association can be neutralized remains to be seen."

Hono(u)rable serves to express the idealistic side of hono(u)r, as in honorable motives where it applauds high-mindedness in the individual. In this sense it may be spelled honorable or honourable, depending on one’s policy with hono(u)r. (Cf. honorary below, and see -or/-our.) It becomes a courtesy title in The Hono(u)rable, used in various institutions, in written references to: \n ∗ the offspring of British aristocracy, including the sons of a marquess, earl, viscount or baron; and daughters of earls and below: The Honourable Diana Spencer. Other institutional titles precede rather than follow: Captain the Honourable Christopher Knolly. \n ∗ senior members of the judiciary in Britain, Australia and Canada: The Honourable Mr. Justice Kirby. In the US it would be Honorable Michael Kirby. \n ∗ Cabinet officers in the US, federal ministers in Canada and Australia as well as provincial/state ministers: The Hono(u)rable Carmen Lawrence. In the UK, Cabinet ministers are entitled to Right Honourable, as members of the Privy Council. \n ∗ members (and former members) of the Canadian Senate: The Honourable Mary Kelly. \n ∗ members of the US Senate, House of Representatives, and State legislatures: Honorable John Krask. \n All such titles can be abbreviated to the Hon.  \n Honorary also has its official uses, with various implications. The spelling never has a u, because of its Latin derivation. An honorary secretary is one who works for an organization without receiving any remuneration, and perhaps gains some honor and recognition for it. An honorary president is appointed on a rather different basis, as a figurehead with no obligation to help run the organization – as when the Prime Minister’s wife is made honorary president of a charity. An honorary degree has something in common with both uses of honorary. It is usually awarded to a distinguished person who does not have to submit to the normal examination procedures; but it also gives recognition to his or her achievements in a particular field. In Latin it is simply said to be honoris causa (“for reason[s] of honor”). \n The Hon. (the Hon.) serves to abbreviate both The Hono(u)rable and the Honorary. The first underlies The Hon. Mrs. Anderson Hunt and Colonel the Hon. Sir Charles Palmer, and the second the Hon. Secretary, Mr. Ken Lucas. In practice the institutional title always follows directly for the Honorary, whereas personal titles or names follow directly, for The Hono(u)rable."

It has drawn a remarkable amount of criticism in sentences such as the following: \n Hopefully they will go and buy the record. \n Objections to this usage are based on the assumption that hopefully is and can only be an adverbial adjunct of manner, and so in that sentence it must mean that the record-buyers are hopeful. Yet no-one would seriously doubt that the word hopefully in such contexts expresses the hopes of the person speaking or writing. It is an attitudinal adverb (or disjunct) which contributes interpersonal meaning to the statement (see further under adverbs section 1). It takes its place beside numerous others, including: \n confidentially frankly happily \n honestly incredibly luckily \n mercifully naturally sadly \n surprisingly thankfully unfortunately \n So why the objection to hopefully? Perhaps it was the sudden rise of the word in the early 60s, and the critical spotlight put on it by the popular press. Perhaps its frequent appearance as the first word of a clause or sentence (as above) makes it conspicuous and clich´ed. Yet despite the continuing resentment of “conservative speakers” (Burchfield, 1996), this use of hopefully is very common. Amid hundreds of BNC examples of the word, more than 75% make it an attitudinal adverb. The Longman Grammar (1999) finds it in news reports and academic prose, as well as conversation.

As adjectives too, their meaning is beginning to be diluted, as when people talk of a horrible performance of Beethoven or having a horrid day. In such expressions horrible and horrid connote a generally negative judgement, and could be paraphrased as “deplorable” and “disagreeable.” In colloquial usage there’s a persistent tendency for strong words to be overused and to lose their force. It has already happened to awful and terrific, and the word formidable has been diluted in a similar way in French.

However has traditionally been associated with academic and discursive writing, but is also heard now from time to time in conversation. Its role there is beginning to affect its grammar. \n 1 Indefinite however serves as an adverb or as a conjunction. Compare: \n However hard they walked, they would not get back before dark. (adverb) \n However they went, it would take half a day. (conjunction) \n Either way the position of indefinite however is fixed. As an adverb (subjunct) in the first sentence, it must precede the adjective it qualifies; and as conjunction in the second it must appear as the very first word of the clause. Note also that indefinite however heads a subordinate clause, whereas contrastive however conjoins main clauses (see below, section 3). This grammatical difference is unmistakable as one reads on in the sentence, and prevents confusion between them. \n ♦ For a discussion of indefinite however and how ever (spaced), see -ever. \n 2 Contrastive however is first and foremost an adverb, more specifically a conjunct or linking adverb (see adverbs section 1). However underscores a point of contrast which is also a link with the previous clause or sentence: \n  We were keen to keep going; they however had had enough. \n However usually follows the contrasting item, and its position in the sentence varies according to the intended scope of the contrast. In that example it creates a sharp contrast between they and we. Broader or more focused contrasts can be achieved with however in other positions: \n We were keen to keep going. \n However they had had enough. \n (contrast between the whole of the first sentence, and the second sentence) \n We were keen to keep going. \n They had had enough however. \n (contrast between the two predicates: keen to keep going / had enough) By its mobility as well as its own bulk, however helps to draw attention to the contrast. Its three syllables make it a weighty substitute for but, and some computer style checkers flag it as “wordy.” Used occasionally its effect is powerful. \n Note that there is no basis for suggesting that contrastive however should not appear at the beginning of a sentence – except perhaps through confusion with indefinite however. In fact almost half of the instances of contrastive however in BNC informative writing appeared as the first word of a sentence. The Longman Grammar (1999) shows that this is the most common position for linking adverbs generally, in speech and in academic prose. Yet contrastive however also tends to occur immediately after the topic item of the sentence (see topic), as in: \n The Government, however, has “no immediate plans” to change . . . \n Under federal law, however, any merger of their operations . . . \n Once the centre opened, however, it quickly became apparent . . . \n In this position however underscores the preceding phrase or clause quite emphatically, while serving its contrastive and cohesive function (see coherence or cohesion section 2). \n 3 Punctuation with contrastive however. Older books on style often say that however should be hedged about with commas, or else a comma and a heavier stop (period/semicolon). The exemplary sentences would then read: \n They, however, had had enough. \n They had had enough, however. \n These days, amid the general trend to reduce punctuation marks, the comma(s) are often left out, especially when however is the first or second item in a simple sentence: \n However they had had enough. \n They however had had enough. \n This practice is explicitly endorsed by the Chicago Manual (1993). It says that the commas associated with adverbs like however (therefore, indeed etc.) should be left out when “there is no real break in continuity, and no call for any pause in reading.” \n But in compound sentences, the punctuation that precedes however has important implications for its grammar. Compare: \n We were keen to keep going. However they had had enough. \n We were keen to keep going; however they had had enough. \n We were keen to keep going, however they had had enough. \n With the punctuation of the first and second examples, however is definitely an adverbial conjunct,working within the confines of its own sentence/clause. The comma used in the third sentence would make however a full conjunction. This shift to conjunction is disallowed in prescriptive grammar, for reasons unclear, except that it would enlarge what is usually taught as a closed set of conjunctions. Yet transcriptions of speech from the BNC show that however works easily as a conjunction in the flow of discourse: \n This was a common pattern, however there is one exception. \n The intonation contour would confirm that however functions there as a conjunction. The comma reflects that usage in speech transcriptions, and writers may also find occasion for it. Neither the Oxford Dictionary (1989) nor Webster’s Third (1986) allows that contrastive however can be a conjunction, and yet its currency is implicit in Burchfield’s (1996) stern censure of “using however as a substitute for but.” Garner (1998) acknowledges its presence in American English, as well as the fact that it tends to be edited out by composition teachers and professional editors. Some dictionaries, for example Collins (1991), do update the record by calling contrastive however a “sentence connector,” a cover term which is designed to “replace the traditional classification of words as adverbs or conjunctions.” (See further under conjunctions and conjuncts.) \n While grammarians and dictionary-makers debate its classification, those anxious about the status of contrastive however can always take the precaution of using a semicolon in front of it (or a period / full stop), as shown in the last set of examples above. It’s just a game, really!"

		"title": "human or humane",
		"explanation":"These adjectives both appeal to the better characteristics of mankind. There are loftier principles in humane, and a humane approach to the prisoners connotes compassion and concern in situations where others might react harshly. The reactions implied in human are much more down-to-earth and typical: \n It was only human to laugh at the situation. \n In their negative forms (inhuman and inhumane), the two words differ again. Inhumane is somewhat formal and detached, pinpointing the lack of compassion, whereas inhuman is charged with a sense of outrage, implying the complete absence of any sympathetic traits, to the point of being monstrous: \n Slave transportation involved the inhuman practice of packing people in between decks, shackled together side by side without head room."

		"title": "humanity, humanism or humanitarianism",

Humanism is the kind of scholarship which concentrates on the tradition of arts and literature in our culture, and the human values they express. The word is also used to refer to a nontheistic approach to life and our place in the universe, and so the word has negative connotations in fundamentalist theology. \n Humanity is first and foremost the abstract noun for the adjective human (see human or humane), and also the collective word for “people at large” or “mankind.” It can be a useful synonym for “mankind” for those who find that word sexist. The plural form humanities refers to the scholarly disciplines which are concerned with arts and literature (cf. humanism). The word then contrasts with sciences and social sciences."

Compare: \n The dear old humbug lied.  \n . . . cut through the humbug and pretence of the art world. \n The second, abstract use of the noun is much more common than the first, in data from both BNC and CCAE. Critical uses of the word by both understatement and overstatement (so much humbug, monumental humbug) are much more common than indulgent ones. American usage highlights the ambivalence of humbug, with P.T. Barnum, the self-styled prince of humbug, along with the “Bah, humbug” of Dickens’s Scrooge, reacting ungenerously to Christmas celebrations. An additional use of humbug (in the UK, Canada and Australia, but not the US) is to refer to an item of confectionery, e.g. peppermint humbugs. \n Most dictionaries register the now rare use of humbug as a verb. It occurs in only a handful of texts in the BNC and not at all in CCAE. When it does, the final letter is doubled (humbugged/humbugging), like that of other compound verbs whose second syllable has a life of its own. (See doubling of final consonant note 3.) \n The derivative humbuggery (first recorded 1831) adds the French suffix -erie (see -ery) to Anglo-Saxon-looking humbug (origin unknown), forming a hybrid which incidentally hints at the taboo as well as meaningless nonsense. This makes it a liability, though in political mud-slinging it lends itself to elaborate putdowns – the suggestion that an opposition speaker must have earned a degree in advanced humbuggery."

		"title": "hummus, hommos or hoummos",
		"explanation":"For that tasty Arabic food made from ground chick peas and sesame oil, there are multiple spellings in English. The variation between single and double m, and the various permutations and combinations of u and o allow for 18 alternative spellings, sometimes seen on menus and product labels. However the field is narrowed down in published texts, and hummus is the commonest by far in both British and American databases (BNC and CCAE). Alongside hummus, Webster’s Third (1986) features hommos, which contributes about 1 in 8 of the citations in CCAE. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) adds hoummous, but it is nowhere to be found in BNC data. There are however a very few examples of humous and houmus. \n One other possible spelling is humus, used inadvertently by at least one writer in both BNC and CCAE. This is the actual spelling in modern Turkish, but in English it’s to be avoided because of the clash with the (neo-Latin) word for “rotting leaf matter.” Most dictionaries trace the gastronomic word to Arabic hummus, hence their traditional preference for that spelling in English. \n  ♦ For other gastronomic loanwords with multiple spellings, see falafel, kebab, tabbouleh, yogurt."

Yet in some pairs of words hyper- sets itself higher than super-, as in hypermarket (clearly one up on the supermarket), and hypersonic which is five times faster than supersonic. The use of hyper- in hypertext associates it with the complex structures of electronic documents, hence also hyperlinks, for the instant connections between them. \n A number of hyper- words have been coined as technical terms to contrast with words beginning with hypo-; see for example hyperthermia/ hypothermia, and further under hypo-. Meanwhile in chemistry, the prefix hyper- has been decommissioned. It was formerly used in the naming of compounds as per- is nowadays, to show that a given element was at its maximum valence (or a relatively high one).

What is said should not be taken literally, but has an emotive or intensifying effect as in the following from a popular song: \n The future’s so bright I gotta wear shades! \n (See further under figures of speech.) \n The colloquial word hype (“publicity designed to create excitement”) is thought by some to be an abbreviation of hyperbole.

Saying between you and I (rather than between you and me) could be explained in the same way (see between you and me [or I]). Some uses of whom are really hypercorrection (see whom section 3). The replacement of cheap by cheaply in idioms such as bought it cheap suggests an anxiety about the bare form of the adverb; see further under zero adverbs.

		"title": "hyphens",
		"explanation":"The single most variable element in the writing of words is the hyphen, hence the large amount of discussion it generates. Hyphens serve both to link and to separate the components of words; and while they are established in the spelling of certain words, they come and go from many others. The use or nonuse of hyphens varies somewhat in different Englishes round the world. In the UK under the influence of the Oxford dictionaries hyphens seem to be used relatively often, and certainly more often than in the US, where according to Webster’s dictionaries the same words may be set solid, or spaced (if compounds). Canadians and Australians are somewhere between Britons and Americans in their readiness to use hyphens. \n Though there are few fixed conventions over hyphens, authorities do agree on such underlying principles as: \n ∗ restrict the use of hyphens as far as possible \n ∗ shed the linking hyphen from the better established formations \n ∗ use hyphens to separate letter sequences which distract the reader from construing the word correctly \n But how to apply these principles to words such as co(-)operate and co(-)ordinate is still a matter of debate. To resolve the issue, writers are sometimes encouraged to adopt the practices of one dictionary – although dictionaries themselves have mixed policies. Their use/nonuse of hyphens with particular words may reflect either typical usage (in so far as they are able to research it), or else editorial policy and their desire to achieve consistency within their own headword list. A further problem is that dictionary lists do not include all possible compounds (“transparent” ones are omitted); nor do they always show what happens to compounds when they are used in new grammatical roles. Many noun compounds which are normally spaced, e.g. cold shoulder or first night, acquire hyphens when they become verbs (they cold-shouldered him) or adjectives (first-night nerves). \n  As in these examples, the grammar of words is quite often what helps to decide whether they should be hyphenated or not. This is why grammatical classes and structures are used below in presenting the general practices for hyphenating compounds. But when dealing with complex words, the legibility of the string of letters is usually the most important issue. \n In the following sections we are concerned with the so-called “hard hyphens” (ones which would be used whenever the word appears), and not “soft hyphens” (ones used to show when a word has been divided at the end of a line, because of insufficient space). Questions about soft hyphens and where to divide words are discussed at wordbreaks. \n ♦ For the so-called hanging hyphen or floating hyphen, see hanging hyphen. 1 Complex words with prefixes are not normally hyphenated, but set solid. See for example: \n amoral biennial cohabit \n  counterrevolutionary debrief dissociate \n  excommunicate \n In some cases however, as with co- and ex-, it depends on whether the word is an older or newer type of formation. See further under co- and ex-. Other exceptions to that general principle are: \n a) using a hyphen when the prefix ends in the same vowel as the first letter of the root word, as in: \n anti-intellectual cf. antireligious \n  de-emphasize deactivate \n As these examples show, there’s no apparent difficulty when a different vowel follows the prefix, at least in longer and established words. However in short words such as de-ice and re-ink, a hyphen seems desirable to prevent misreading. \n b) introducing a hyphen in formations which would otherwise be identical with another word. So the hyphen in re-cover (the furniture) helps to distinguish it from recover, just as one in re-mark differentiates it from remark etc. \n c) using a hyphen when the following word involves a change in typography, such as capital letters, numbers, to or from italics, or quotation marks: \n  anti-Fascist post-1954 \n pre-perestroika un-“macho” \n Complex words with suffixes are almost always set solid, witness: \n advertisement chauvinism \n rationalize resourceful \n A hyphen is still sometimes inserted where the root ends in a vowel and the following suffix begins with a vowel, particularly in formations which are new or not commonly seen in print. So more-ish is preferred by some to moreish (which violates the general principle of dropping -e before suffixes beginning with a vowel; see -e). Some writers also prefer a hyphen before -ed and -ing in ad hoc verbs such as quota-ed and to-ing and fro-ing. Alternative devices are discussed under -ed (section 3). \n 2 Compounds. The use of hyphens with compounds at large seems rather unpredictable. Yet within certain grammatical groups, especially verbs, adverbs and adjectives, there are regular principles. Noun compounds (see below, [d]) are the most varied group of all. \n a) Compound verbs are either hyphenated or set solid, depending on their components. Those consisting of a noun + verb, such as baby-sit, gift-wrap, red-pencil, short-list are typically hyphenated. Those consisting of an adverb + verb, such as bypass, outlast, underrate, upstage are set solid. \n b) Compound adverbs are usually set solid, witness examples such as the following: \n  barefoot downstairs \n overboard underground \n upstream \n c) Compound adjectives are typically hyphenated, but see the exceptions (both set solid and spaced) below. The typical pattern is seen in established cases such as: \n tone-deaf red-hot all-embracing \n home-baked icy-cold labor-saving \n nuclear-free open-ended \n Hyphens are also used in ad hoc compound adjectives, as in open-door policy and red-carpet treatment, to ensure they’re construed as intended by the writer. They are also used regularly in compounds which contain numbers written as full words, for example four-part, two-state, as well as in fractions used in adjectival roles: two-thirds majority. See however the last exception below, when numbers are written as Arabic numerals. \n Exceptions to the hyphenated pattern are: \n *a few very well-established adjective compounds which are set solid. They usually consist of a simple adverb + verb, such as everlasting, forthcoming, underdone, widespread. \n *compounds with an inflected adverb or adjective as their first element, which are normally spaced. So there’s no hyphen in expressions such as the following: \n badly displayed goods \n fully   fledged scheme \n higher level units \n best known examples \n *adjectives involving more, most, less, least. \n Hyphens are only used if there is some danger of ambiguity – for example more expert staff could be read as either (more expert) staff or more (expert staff) – and then only if the sentence cannot be reworded to clarify the issue. Writers should avoid having their meaning hang on a hyphen. \n *compound adjectives which are institutionalized concepts, such as: \n equal opportunity employer \n city council elections \n high school teachers \n twelfth century manuscript \n *compound adjectives which embrace items with a change of typography, including Arabic numbers, capitals, italics and quotation marks. For example: \n Year 12 students \n the US Airforce base \n their haute cuisine menu \n his “do” or “die” attitude \n Style manuals including the Chicago Manual (2003) and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) recommend against using hyphens in foreign phrases used as compound adjectives, whether or not they are italicized. So there would be no hyphen in expressions such as de facto marriage or dernier cri footwear. Foreign phrases are read as units, and their components do not need to be linked with hyphens. \n d) Compound nouns can be written with hyphens, spaced, or set solid, depending somewhat on what they consist of (see below). Yet quite a number of them have different settings according to different dictionaries. Noun compounds, more than any others, are subject to the well-known principle that they begin life spaced, become hyphenated, and are finally set solid. See for example: dark room, dark-room, darkroom. However authorities often differ over how well advanced the integration of the two components may be, with British dictionaries often prolonging the use of the hyphen, and their American counterparts preferring to join up the components or else keep them spaced. \n Of all the major grammatical types, noun compounds are least likely to need a hyphen (or solid setting) to ensure that their components are read together. The great majority of them have the qualifying component first and the qualified component second, so they can be read like any ordinary sequence of adjective plus noun. Many may just as well be left spaced, and dictionaries the world over show that this is the normal practice with some types particularly: \n ∗ those consisting of two polysyllabic words, e.g. geography teacher, unemployment benefit \n ∗ those whose first component has more than one syllable, e.g. buffer state, concert pitch, customs house \n ∗ those with strong stress on both components, e.g. damp squib, green ban, tree fern \n Apart from these considerations, the internal grammar of the compound can often suggest how it’s likely to be set, as follows: \n i) those consisting of a simple adjective + noun, such as black market, red tape, are usually spaced. The exceptions are elliptical expressions such as bigwig, redneck, which combine to qualify another (understood) entity. \n ii) those consisting of adverb + verb, or verb + adverb, such as downpour, runoff, are usually set solid – except that a hyphen is used to separate an otherwise distracting sequence of letters, as in go-ahead, shake-out. Hyphens are used as a connecting device when there are inflections on the verbal first element, as in: \n goings-on hanger-on \n passer-by summing-up \n iii) those consisting of verb + noun or noun + verb, such as rattlesnake, snakebite, may go one of two ways. When the verb component comes first and is inflected, the parts are usually left spaced, as in flying saucer, helping hand, revolving door. When the inflected verb is the second component, the compound is usually set solid: \n mindreader wordprocessor \n glassblowing sightseeing \n iv) those consisting of noun + noun can often be left spaced, as in dial tone, trade union, traffic jam. But they are set solid when the second component is a common and general word which depends on the preceding word for its specificity. See for example: \n policeman anchorman chairman \n marketplace birthplace commonplace \n letterhead bulkhead figurehead \n tigerfish jellyfish lumpfish \n roadwork wickerwork earthwork \n The few sets of noun compounds that regularly have hyphens are structured differently from all of the above. They are: \n ∗ those in which the two components are very much equal terms, e.g. city-state, owner-operator, secretary-stenographer \n ∗ those with rhyming or reduplicative components, e.g. culture-vulture, hanky-panky, sin-bin \n ∗ those with a specifying phrase following the head noun, e.g. ambassador-at-large, mother-in-law, theatre-in-the-round. Outside the US (in Britain, Canada and Australia), there are more in this category, e.g. editor-in-chief, lady-in-waiting, prisoner-of-war. \n ♦ For the use of hyphens in placenames involving French saints, see Saint section 1."

(Note that linguists sometimes use the term hypernym for the superordinate.) \n The relationship between hyponyms and their nearer or more remote superordinates is important in the cognitive structures of thinking and writing.

	{
		"title": "I",
		"explanation":"When can I be used in writing? It depends on what’s being written. Personal letters, diaries and autobiography are the natural medium for I, talking about opinions, attitudes and feelings (“I think,” “I know,” “I feel” etc.). I occurs naturally in scripted dialogue and many types of fiction. But in professional writing we conventionally avoid I even when expressing individual opinions. Thus a reviewer is less likely to say: \n I was delighted by the freshness of the performance . . . \n than \n The performance was delightfully fresh. \n Personal opinion is less obvious in the second sentence, where it’s blended into the description with an attitudinal adverb (“delightfully”). It implies that anyone viewing the performance would see it that way, as if there’s a weight of opinion behind the comment. By avoiding the use of I, the writer masks the subjectiveness of the reaction. \n The need to sound authoritative and professional no doubt underlies the convention of avoiding I in academic and bureaucratic writing. It also applies in science, though it was not always so. Newton and other pioneering scientists used I quite freely. The pronoun was not regularly suppressed in science writing until late C19 (Halliday, 1988), since when an impersonal style replete with passive verbs has been conventional for scientific writers. Yet one school of scientists – the US Council of Biology Editors – has since the 1960s actively encouraged the use of I, and others are allowing it back in. In the UK a study of science and engineering writing by Kirkman (1980) found a sprinkling of the pronoun I in many of the papers published in academic journals. The study also showed that scientists hardly noticed low levels of I, though they reacted negatively to its frequent use, finding it either amateurish or arrogant. Kirkman concluded that “judicious” use of I was no problem. \n More systematic use of I can be found in other contexts. In some government departments, ministerial letters bearing the chief ’s signature make strategic use of the first person. The motivation may be as much to project the image of a strong executive head as to avoid an impersonal bureaucratic style. Proactive editors of academic manuscripts sometimes make a point of turning every “it was found that” into “I found that,” in the interests of readability. This practice can however impair the line of argument which the author has built in (see further under topic). \n So the reasons for using I in writing, or suppressing it, are complex and vary with the context. Writers who avoid it may be adhering to older convention, or trying to divert attention from the lack of evidence for their opinion. Saying “This is not acceptable” sounds much more powerful than “I cannot accept this,” whether or not there’s anything to support it. Let the reader beware! \n Grammatical notes: choosing between I and me I is the nominative form of the pronoun, used for the subject of the verb: I wanted to walk. Me serves for the accusative, when the pronoun is the object of the verb: They wanted me to walk. So far so good. The choice is less obvious when: \n  *the pronoun complements the subject, after the verb be. Traditional grammarians argued that It is I was the only correct form, whereas conversational usage has long endorsed It’s me. Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) shows that both appear freely in contemporary news and fiction, but in different constructions. It’s me is far more common when the pronoun is final (i.e. nothing following it), whereas the opposite holds when the construction has a following relative clause introduced by who, as in it’s I who suggested it. This explains why It is I as a simple sentence sounds so very formal. \n *the pronoun is used after as or than. Me appears much more often than I in conversation, where as/than take prepositional roles, as in better than me. When a verb is added, they become conjunctions as in X did better than I did, and the use of I goes with its being the subject of the following clause. Neither construction is common in nonfiction writing, according to the Longman Grammar (see further under than). \n *the pronoun is coordinated with another noun, pronoun or name. In theory the choice of I or me still depends on the grammar of the clause: X and I used for the subject and X and me for the object. Compare: \n John and I liked them \n with \n They liked John and me. \n Yet in conversation me is sometimes used for I when it’s the first coordinate of the subject: Me and my wife were there first. It often happens when the coordinated phrase is appositional to the clause, as in: \n You and me, we’re a great team. \n In examples like these, the case of the pronoun seems to be neutralized within the phrase (Wales, 1996); and me rather than I is used as the conversational option. I is still strongly preferred in all kinds of writing, from everyday news to academic prose, by the evidence of the Longman Grammar corpus. \n  Hypercorrect use of between you and I is discussed at between you and me. For other issues with the first person singular pronoun, see me. \n ♦ For the ordering of I/me and other personal pronouns, see person."

		"title": "i before e",
		"explanation":"The well-known rule of English spelling “i before e except after c” needs some fine-tuning to make it fully reliable. What about science, conscience, conscientious, for example? Not to mention their, height, weight and weird – among others which do not obey the “rule.” \n Both kinds of exceptions can be accounted for if we add an extra line to the rule: \n i before e except after c, when it sounds like “ee” \n In this fuller form, the rule doesn’t claim to cover any of the exceptional words above, because none of them has the ie/ei sounding exactly like “ee.” The rule is still a useful guide for spelling words like ceiling, deceit, receipt (ei after c); and for achieve, belief, grief, niece, piece, relieve, siege (i.e. because there’s no preceding c). The only common exceptions to the rule in its fuller form are seize, leisure (for many North Americans), and either/neither (for those who pronounce them with “ee” rather than “eye”). These variable pronunciations suggest further fine-tuning of the rule: \n i before e except after c, when it always sounds like “ee” \n Put that way, the only exception is seize, apart from chemical terms like caffeine and protein."

		"title": "i/y",
		"explanation":"Large dictionaries register spellings with either i or y for a handful of English words: \n cider/cyder cipher/cypher \n dike/dyke gipsy/gypsy \n kibosh/kybosh pigmy/pygmy \n silvan/sylvan siphon/syphon \n sirup/syrup stimy/stymy \n  tire/tyre \n Usage everywhere converges on the i spelling for cider and kibosh, and the y spelling for gypsy, pygmy, stymie/stymy, sylvan, syrup (see individual headings). The others vary in spelling in either the UK or the US. Where Americans have settled on the i spelling in cipher and siphon for both noun and verb (by the evidence of CCAE), the British still make use of cypher and syphon, which appear in 30% to 40% of all instances of those words in the BNC. The American preference for i is underscored by two other cases (dike/dyke and tire/tyre), in which spelling intersects with meaning. The i spelling serves in the US to differentiate dike (“embankment”) from dyke (“lesbian”), while British writers tend to use dyke for both (see dike or dyke). The tables are turned with tire/tyre – where the British distinguish tire (“become weary”) from tyre (“rubber wheel cover”), and Americans write both as tire (see tyre or tire). The net effect is to make i spellings more visible in American English. \n Other words with i/y spelling variation are classical and neoclassical, such as dyad, dyarchy, dysfunctional, tyro (see under individual headings). The alternate spellings intersect with meaning for calix/calyx (see under that heading). \n Alternation between i and y once affected a very much larger number of English words. In the first century and a half of printing (until mid-C16), i was routinely replaced with y in words like ship (spelled as shyp[pe]) because of the flimsiness of i in early printers’ fonts. Since then, i has steadily recovered its ground, and i/y alternation persists only in the words mentioned above, and as a regular change before certain suffixes. See further under -ie > -y-, -y > -i-. \n Note that the equivalence of i and y is still exploited in surnames like Smyth and Whyte, though the spelling is fixed for the individuals who bear them. Anyone who writes to them or about them must take care."

In the development of scientific nomenclature, it was used in naming medical conditions such as anorexia, aphasia, hernia, insomnia; and in myriads of plant names such as aubrietia, camellia, fuchsia, wisteria. These and specialized abstract words such as utopia and academia embody a neo-classical singular (feminine) suffix -ia, with roots in both Latin and Greek.

Often the answer is no. Those paired in that list do not differ significantly in meaning, though one may be more current than the other, as with botanic(al) and poetic(al), or enjoy some degree of regional preference (see individual headings). Only for geographic(al) and obstetric(al) do these preferences run in opposite directions (see individual headings). Other things being equal, the shorter form recommends itself. Yet the extra syllable could enhance the rhythm of a phrase for those with an ear to their prose. \n In cases such as comic/comical, electric/electrical, lyric/lyrical, the two words have slightly different applications, discussed under their respective headings. Typically the -ic spelling corresponds more closely to the core meaning of the stem, while the meaning of the -ical spelling is rather generalized. Some others show greater divergence, notably economic/economical, historic/historical, politic/political, as discussed in their individual entries. \n In past centuries (from C15 to C17) there were many more such pairs derived from classical sources – grammatic(al), identic(al), organic(al), tragic(al) – where time has selected one or the other for us, but not consistently -ic or -ical, as those examples show. The form with -ical has been the survivor when there was a comparable noun in -ic(s). This explains why we now use logical, musical, physical, rhetorical, tactical, all of which had counterpart adjectives ending in -ic in earlier centuries. \n Adverbs for -ic/-ical adjectives. The parity of adjectives in -ic and -ical helps to explain why the adverbs for both types end in -ically. So, for example, the adverbs for organic and tragic are organically and tragically. Even though the -ical forms of the adjectives have long since disappeared, their ghosts appear in the adverbs. The effect is there even for adjectives which never had a counterpart ending in -ical. So barbaric, basic, civic, drastic and others become barbarically, basically etc., and it’s as if -ally is the adverbial ending for them. This has become the general rule for all adjectives ending in -ic except public, whose adverb is still normally publicly. (See further under publicly or publically.) In centuries past there were others like it: franticly and heroicly appear in the classics of English literature. But they too now form adverbs with -ally (frantically, heroically); and with a sprinkling of publically in both British and American source material, we may speculate on whether the one remaining exception will be brought back under the rule."

Those ending in -ic are much older words going back to the medieval curriculum, whereas those ending in -ics are modern academic disciplines. Yet whether formed with -ic or -ics, the word normally takes a singular verb: \n Mathematics has something in common with logic. \n Note that this does not apply when the word is modified in some way so as to restrict its field of reference. \n His mathematics were those of a shopkeeper. \n The mathematics of gambling are based on probability theory."

The spelling ikon is mostly found in writing concerned with the Eastern orthodox church, and it keeps the word closer to the original Greek (eikon transliterates it exactly). The use of icon (but not ikon) as a computer graphic adds to its range, and to the reasons why it’s overwhelmingly preferred by writers in both BNC and CCAE.

Perhaps this reflects the power of the Microsoft Manual of Style (1998) which recommends against iconize and prefers “shrink to an icon” – though the very recommendation suggests that iconize enjoys some popularity among software writers. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) lists iconize, but only with the meaning “form into an image,” which died in C17. Iconify (with the computer meaning) is the only one registered in New Oxford (1998)."

In British data from the BNC, identical to outnumbers identical with by more than 2:1, and in American data from CCAE the ratio is more than 12:1.

		"title": "identify with",
		"explanation":"This expression has been used reflexively for 200 years, as in \n He identified himself with the working class. \n But its elliptical counterpart (he identified with the working class) seems to have attracted negative attention in the later C20, probably because it was disputed by Gowers in his 1965 edition of Fowler’s Modern English Usage, and by American commentators from Follett (1966) on. Gowers’s objections seem to be that identify with belongs in psychology, and that its meaning becomes casual in fashionable idiom. He inserts it into Fowler’s list of “slipshod extensions,” and crossreferences it to other “popularized technicalities” and “vogue words.” Judgements apart, the elliptical construction has become increasingly common since World War II, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989); and its currency is recognized in both Merriam-Webster (2000) and New Oxford (1998). The latter updates the Oxford Dictionary (1989) where it’s still labeled “obs(olete),” with no citation after 1834 – which would explain Gowers’s discomfort over its C20 revival."

But crossreferencing from ideograph to ideogram in recent British and American dictionaries (New Oxford, 1998, Merriam-Webster, 2000) suggests that ideogram is now preferred. Figurative uses of ideogram (but not the other) also help to show that it’s the more lively of the two.

An idiom in this sense is a fixed unit whose elements cannot be varied. Neither a red fish nor a reddish-colored herring can capture the meaning of the idiom a red herring. The meaning resides in the whole expression, and cannot be built up or extracted from its parts. \n The word idiom is sometimes extended to include the conventional and arbitrary collocations of the language. English idiom makes it hit by (a car) but hit with (a hammer) – hence the comment that “hit with a car” is not idiomatic English."

		"title": "idiosyncrasy or idiosyncracy",
		"explanation":"The second spelling seems more likely, and yet the first is the standard everywhere in the English-speaking world. The element -crasy is the Greek word for “mixture,” and taken literally idiosyncrasy means “one’s own-together-mixing,” i.e. that special blend of things that make up a unique entity. Yet -crasy appears in no other English word, and not so surprisingly people are inclined to write idiosyncracy, with the ending they know from autocracy, democracy etc. (see further under -cracy). Examples of its use date back to C17, and an article in Word Study (1957) reported almost a score from C20, in both academic and general publications, edited in the US and elsewhere. The evidence was powerful and Webster’s Third (1986) registers idiosyncracy as an alternative to idiosyncrasy. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) acknowledges it with the label “erroneous,” though its several citations are from literary and linguistic writing. Here, as elsewhere in British English, etymology holds sway over analogy; while American English allows for analogical reinterpretation and reconstruction."

		"title": "i.e., ie. or ie",
		"explanation":"This common abbreviation stands for the Latin phrase id est (“that is”), used when offering further explanation or a paraphrase of a previous statement. For example:  \n He came into contact with Free Churches, i.e. ones not tied to either the Church of England or the Roman Catholics. \n Note that i.e. is not used to introduce examples, which is the function of e.g. (see e.g.). These days i.e. is usually set in roman, not italics. \n The conventional punctuation for i.e. is to put stops after each letter, according to both the Chicago Manual (2003), and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002). In practice this is done more consistently in the US than the UK, by database evidence from CCAE and the BNC. In the latter case, i.e. was fully stopped in only about 70% of examples. Among the rest, around 20% had no stops at all (ie), and 10% had just one stop (ie.) \n Traditionally i.e. was framed by punctuation marks – preceded by a comma (or else a dash, colon or an opening bracket), and followed by a comma. Yet both Fowler (1926) and Gowers (1965) allowed for discretion, and these days the following comma is usually omitted. About 95% of BNC examples of i.e. (and ie.) did without it. It was however much more evident when the abbreviation itself was left unstopped: almost half of the examples of ie were followed by a comma. The comma thus becomes a curious substitute for the stop that the abbreviation might otherwise have. Some kind of delimiter thus seems to be felt necessary, despite the broader British trend to reduce stops in abbreviations. In both British and American English there is usually some punctuation mark preceding i.e. In BNC data this was almost always so with i.e., and held for 85% of examples with ie. also. \n Like other Latin abbreviations, i.e. is increasingly accepted without paraphrase in many kinds of document. Style manuals have traditionally confined such abbreviations to footnotes and parenthetical references, but the Chicago Manual (1993) notes their increased use in technical writing of all kinds. The British view as expressed in Copy-editing (1992) is also accommodating of i.e., and British editors are cautioned against routine paraphrasing of i.e. The Australian government Style Manual (2002) echoes the Chicago Manual on the now widespread use of the abbreviation; and Canadian English Usage (1997) observes it in “running text of all kinds.” In BNC data i.e. turns up in many kinds of informative and academic prose, and in interactive discourse: \n Does it complete the nitrogen cycle, i.e. convert nitrate into nitrogen? \n These goals will be for weight and also possibly for size, i.e. your “vital statistics.” \n “I’m surprised that someone like you can have such a fixed view of someone else, i.e. me.” \n With i.e. established in standard usage, most writers and readers are comfortable with seeing the abbreviation in print. No longer should it be subject to automatic paraphrase by the editor. \n ♦ See further under Latin abbreviations."

The change happens when -ing is added to the stem, as in dying, lying etc., and clearly it avoids awkward-looking forms like “diing,” “liing” which would result from simply applying the regular rule of removing final e before -ing (see -e).

	{
		"title": "-ie/-y",
		"explanation":"In colloquial references to certain kinds of people, these two spellings often alternate: \n cabbie/cabby hippie/hippy \n junkie/junky kiddie/kiddy \n In cases like these, either spelling may be used for the suffix, which is a “familiarity marker,” in the terminology of the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). The core use of such terms, illustrated by kiddy, is hypocoristic, i.e. to provide a “pet” name for people within the family circle (see hypocorisms). Other examples are daddy, granny, mummy/mommy, which would explain why kiddy is generally preferred to kiddie for this usage in British English, by the evidence of BNC. This leaves kiddie free – at least in American English – to serve as the adjective meaning “strictly for kids, childish” as in kiddie pool, kiddie show. \n Most newer words with -ie/-y are outside the family circle, as the other examples show, but they are still apparently motivated by the need to express familiarity. Here the -ie ending is usually the commoner of the two, as is true of cabbie, hippie, junkie in American English (by the evidence of CCAE), and of cabbie, junkie – but not hippy – in British English data from the BNC. (Does this make the hippy more part of the family, you may ask!) Many words of this kind have only been recorded with -ie (bookie, chappie, groupie, rookie, townie etc.). The -ie spelling allows instant recognition of the fact that they are colloquial nouns, whereas with -y they just could be adjectives (see further under -y). \n In some cases the use of -ie clearly serves to distinguish the colloquial noun from an existing adjective ending in -y. See for example: \n chalkie (Aus/NZ) chalky “containing or covered with chalk” \n hippie “bohemian” hippy “having large hips” \n junkie “one addicted to something” junky “valueless” \n The -ie suffix is no longer restricted to people, but increasingly put to use in familiar names for entertainments, among other things. In footie/footy (“football”), soapie (“soap opera”), talkie (“talking picture,” i.e. movie with soundtrack), the underlying compound is trimmed down to its most essential syllable. This makes it less transparent to the outsider, but strong on solidarity for insiders. Many -ie words used freely by Australians (e.g. pokie for “poker machine”) would be opaque to others; and some used by the British would be unfamiliar to Americans – who make least use of this type of word formation. \n Personal names with -ie or -y In the spelling of popular names and abbreviations of names there’s sometimes a choice between -ie and -y, as in Chrissie/Chrissy, Johnnie/Johnny for example. Celebrated names are nevertheless often fixed, e.g. Billy Connolly, Willie Carson, Andy Warhol, Nellie Bly. And whenever such names are actually given names, as often with Kellie/Kelly, Kerrie/Kerry among others, the point needs to be checked. The bearer will be very conscious whether the name has been spelled their way or not."

		"title": "if",
		"explanation":"The ambiguities latent in if are easily resolved by intonation in speech, but need careful handling in writing. When if is used as a substitute for whether, the implicit meaning is “whether or not” – which may be what was intended in: \n You’ll let us know if you’re coming . . . \n That sentence could become a question or an indirect command, depending on the intonation. Either way, it seeks to clarify whether people are coming or not, but it’s not really clear. The words themselves could be taken to mean that people are expected to reply “if and only if ” they intend to come. To prevent misunderstanding (especially over the lack of communication when it was expected), the sentence would be better expressed as: \n Would you let us know whether or not you’re coming? \n This leaves no room for misunderstanding, though the casualness of the original is lost. \n If can also be a source of ambiguity when combined in a phrase with not: \n There was a short if not hasty consultation with the coach. \n In such a string of words, if not could mean either “short although not hasty,” or “short as well as hasty.” In other words, if not could be either contrastive or additive (see further under conjunctions). Writers no doubt use if not sometimes to opt out of making a judgement and keep things ambiguous. But if the writer’s judgement or meaning are important, if not is best avoided. \n If and the subjunctive. In conditional clauses, if serves to express things which might be. Some are real contingencies, others purely hypothetical. The two kinds of possibility can be distinguished by the choice of verb: \n If she were more forgiving, they might have reached an agreement. \n If he was back from New York he’d lend a hand. \n In the first sentence, if is coupled with the past subjunctive were to express an impossible condition (see further under subjunctive). In the second the ordinary indicative form of the verb (was) is used to express a condition which is a real possibility. This distinction is not always clear-cut however; and the indicative tends to replace the subjunctive in less formal styles, as noted in the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). Even the fixed phrase if I were you gets casually rephrased as if I was you. The absence of past subjunctive forms for any verbs other than be is another reason why the distinction is breaking down. The use of were after if he/she/it is now a matter of formality of style rather than grammar."

		"title": "-ify/-efy",
		"explanation":"These verb endings are identical in sound and meaning, yet are attached by convention to different verbs. The less common ending by far is -efy, which makes its appearance in only four words: liquefy, putrefy, rarefy, stupefy. But -ify is the ending for many, of which the following are just a handful: \n amplify beautify clarify \n classify exemplify fortify \n  glorify gratify identify \n justify petrify purify quantify \n simplify vilify \n The reason why words have either -efy or -ify is a matter of their individual history. In C21 English it seems quite arbitrary, and so the minority group with -efy are sometimes spelled with -ify. It happens especially with liquify (no doubt because of liquid). In American data from CCAE, more than 30% of occurrences of the word were liquify, and the rate is close to 40% in data from the BNC. \n Many dictionaries present liquify as an alternative to liquefy, whereas only the largest recognize alternatives for the others. Webster’s Third (1986) registers putrify and rarify, and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) has stupify as well, but indicates that all the -ify alternatives became obsolescent in the latter half of C19. In fact there’s a sprinkling of rarified in the reference databases – about 8% and 18% of the total British and American citations respectively. Stupified occurs just once in the BNC and is greatly outnumbered by stupefied; but CCAE data show that it’s relatively more common in American English. No doubt the analogous adjective (stupid ) – and common pronunciation – seem to support it. The same things apply with putrify, but there’s too little data to confirm it. The forces of analogy are still evidently at work here, nudging the -efy verbs into line with the much larger set formed with -ify. \n Note that -ify is always the spelling for new and ad hoc formations, such as countrify, funkify, gentrify, yuppify (not “countryfy” etc.). Here the -ify shows the normal change of y to i when it becomes bound by a suffix (see -y > -i-). It obviously helps to dissimilate the two ys (see further under dissimilate)."

Illegitimate is best known in the cold phrase illegitimate child, i.e. one born outside the laws of marriage. Apart from this illegitimate is also used in academic discussion, to describe an argument, conclusion or inference which is unsound by the laws of logic. Illicit is applied to activities which are not permitted by law, e.g. illicit gambling, an illicit love affair or keeping an illicit still. Among those who are privy to such things, they are a well-kept secret, and so illicit has more than a whiff of enjoying forbidden fruits."

		"title": "illiterate and illiteracy",
		"explanation":"Essentially illiterate means “unable to read or write.” Even in societies with compulsory schooling, there’s a small percentage of adults with no command of the written word, and so illiterate has some application in that sense. \n Yet because reading and writing are taken for granted by the majority, the threshold of “literacy” is often implicitly raised beyond the basic command of letters. Thus literate comes to mean “well acquainted with book learning,” and illiterate “showing little acquaintance with books” or “ill-educated.” Only in this second sense can a person’s writing be described as “illiterate.” Those who use the word this way no doubt count themselves among the literati (see litterateurs or literati). \n Fowler’s (1926) use of illiteracy – to refer to one of a somewhat arbitrarily chosen set of divergent expressions – is an even narrower application of the word. It makes it a count noun (an illiteracy, illiteracies), which can be increased and multiplied to suit the commentator. If illiteracy in this sense seems less old-fashioned than “vulgarism,” the judgement is just as dismissive (see under vulgar)."

		"title": "image and imagery",
		"explanation":"In C21, few would question the use of image to mean the “total impression given by a person, institution, company or product etc.” This sense was first recorded in 1908, but gained little currency until the late 1950s. After that it enjoyed such a vogue as to raise anxiety in style commentators, hence Burchfield’s (1996) equivocal remark that it has “seeped into the vocabulary of every articulate person in the land.” We need hardly be surprised at the public person’s preoccupation with image when the mass media are pervasive in society and culture. Use of the word simply reflects its importance for any person or product whose success depends on mobilizing public opinion. \n The image generated by publicity, and the image which a writer creates are somewhat different. The first is rather abstract, like the sophistication and glamor which is supposed to accompany drinking that glass of wine held by a manicured hand. The poet’s image is much more tangible, when he says “Drink to me only with thine eyes,” and conjures up the very act of drinking and toasting. Another difference is that the image of the advertised product is already a composite of ideas, whereas the images raised by a poem or piece of writing usually serve to develop its imagery sequentially. Yet both the publicity image, and the writer’s imagery put a particular coloring or set of values on whatever they present, so as to influence people’s thinking. \n ♦ See also analogy, and metaphors."

		"title": "imaginary or imaginative",
		"explanation":"These words express different attitudes to imagination and the products of our imagination. Phrases such as an imaginative approach and an imaginative solution show that imaginative is often a positive quality, and that the imagination is seen as a constructive and creative resource. \n The word imaginary affirms that something has been imagined and is fictitious, such as an imaginary conversation or an imaginary illness. The adjective has negative connotations if what is imagined is used to deceive or to manipulate others, but otherwise it’s neutral. So David Malouf ’s novel An Imaginary Life (on the life of Ovid) is a perfectly acceptable fiction. The book is also highly imaginative, but the author leaves it to readers and critics to apply that word."

		"explanation":"This word appeared first in scientific English in the form impacted (as in impacted tooth), based on the Latin adjective impactus. Impact as a noun was derived from it late in C18, and is now the commonest form of the word by far. Instances of the noun run into thousands in the BNC, where there are less than 100 of impact as a verb. It first appeared in early C20, again in scientific writing, but has since been taken up in the discourse of business and government, as in: \n The housing market impacts on consumer spending in two ways. \n The policy was impacting men and women alike. \n These constructions are registered without demur in Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997); and the Canadian Oxford (1998) goes out of its way to note that they are well established despite the objections of some. New Oxford (2000) distances itself from them, as “Chiefly American,” and warns that some in the UK react negatively to impact on as a verb (it doesn’t comment on the other construction). Verbal use of impact on is evident in a variety of informative British writing in the BNC, suggesting that its currency is growing.

		"title": "imperial, imperious or imperative",
		"explanation":"With the decline of empires and emperors, there’s less for imperial to do – not that imperialism is dead. The word remains as a monument to former empires in phrases like imperial Rome, and to former emperors in the Imperial Palace to be visited by tourists in China and Japan. Imperial College London and the Imperial War Museum preserve the name despite the commutation of the British Empire into the (British) Commonwealth. In corporate nomenclature such as Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) it’s a sign of the longevity of the firm. Most other British imperial institutions have disappeared, or been renamed. Gone are the days when the webs of portly tropical spiders could interrupt an imperial dispatch, according to a BNC citation. The most widely known surviving imperial institution is the imperial system of weights and measures, on which see the next entry. \n Neither imperious nor imperative have any connection with empires. Yet imperious implies the will to make others do your bidding, as in: a loud imperious knocking on the ceiling, or the sharp, imperious police whistle. Imperious is usually applied to human behavior, imperative to circumstances which force us to do something: \n It was imperative not to get embroiled in politics. \n Note that imperative also serves as a noun: \n In Keynes’s view the great imperative was public works. \n For the grammatical use of imperative, see under that heading."

		"title": "imperial weights and measures",
		"explanation":"The imperial system of weights and measures is gradually being replaced by the metric or international system everywhere in the English-speaking world. Britain’s membership of the EU has accelerated the changeover, and metres and litres are well represented in BNC data when standard lengths and volumes are quoted, as in: \n 400 metres to the terminal building \n the kit (L29.99) covers four to six square metres \n one million litres of milk \n a lighter car with an engine of less than 6.75 litres \n Still yards and gallons/pints continue to be used, especially in casual references: a couple of hundred yards, downed a few pints. The juxtaposition of metric and imperial measures, as in a capacity of 230 litres (50 gallons), and of temperatures in degrees Celsius as well as Fahrenheit, are a reminder that the change is still going on. \n In the US, change to the international system is an “officially recognized goal” (Chicago Manual, 1993), most evident in the military, scientific and sporting domains. But in ordinary discourse the imperial gallon is used 20 times more often than the liter, by their relative frequencies in CCAE; and the yard outnumbers the meter in a similar ratio. In Canada the metric system is much more fully implemented, being the point of convergence between anglophones and francophones. In Australia the imperial system was officially replaced by the metric system back in 1970, and in New Zealand in 1987. Younger people absorb the metric system as part of their schooling, even if their elders still calibrate things in imperial measures, putting distances in miles, and human weight in pounds and stones. The key terms of the imperial system include: \n ∗ for length: inch foot yard chain furlong mile \n ∗ for mass: ounce pound stone hundredweight ton \n ∗ for volume: fluid ounce pint quart gallon \n Some of these linger in common idiom: \n a six footer wouldn’t budge an inch \n miles from anywhere \n drinking whisky by the gallon \n Imperial measures persist in a number of specialized fields of sport and industry the world over. A tennis net is set at 3 feet or 1 yard (= 0.914 metres) above the ground, and a cricket pitch is still a chain or 22 yards in length (= 20.12 metres). Printers calculate the dimensions of a piece of printed text in picas, which measure just on one sixth of an inch. The screws used by engineers and carpenters are normally calibrated in terms of so many turns to the inch, and by British Standard Whitworth norms, rather than the ISO-metric system. The altitudes at which aircraft fly are given in feet (e.g. 37 000 feet), and nautical usage maintains its own standard units for depth (fathom), speed (knot) and sea distance (nautical mile). \n ♦ For the metric system of units, see metrication.

It may hide the character and attitudes of the writer, so that the information seems detached from both sender and receiver of the message, and shows no human perspective on it: \n  The Library will no longer open on Sundays, as of March 1. \n Impersonal style like that is often produced in the name of an institution, when the writer becomes an official voice, addressing a vast, mixed audience whose reactions are not known. \n Writing can also seem impersonal when it avoids referring to human participation in the action it describes, as in: \n It was decided that the meeting should be adjourned. \n This is of course typical of the way in which the minutes of meetings are recorded. It can be frustrating if you want to know who prevailed in the debate. But the impersonal “it was decided” embodies the democratic principle that the majority decides the issue, whether or not there were dissenting votes from influential individuals. In science writing it’s also conventional for experimenters to report their work impersonally, on the assumption that what was done (rather than who did it) is what other scientists need to know: \n  A small piece of sodium was added to the flask of water. \n This preference for passive was added instead of the active “I [the experimenter] added a small piece of sodium . . . ” is now being questioned by some scientific bodies (see further under I). \n For the moment, impersonal style serves a number of conventional purposes, bureaucratic and scientific. But in other contexts – where communication needs to be lively, human and sensitive to the individual – the impersonal style with its official and academic overtones is to be avoided."

		"title": "imply or infer",
		"explanation":"The distinction commonly drawn between these two words makes them reciprocal. A writer or statement may imply something (i.e. convey a suggestion), which readers may or may not infer (pick up). But usage commentators note the persistent habit of using infer rather than imply in sentences like the following: \n The correspondent inferred in his letter published in June that you were biased. \n This use of infer, making it synonymous with imply, is recognized in all modern dictionaries although they attach warning labels to it, dubbing it “colloquial” or “loose usage.” The Harper–Heritage panel of the 1970s almost all rejected it, and the second edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1989) adds a note that it is “widely considered to be incorrect.” Webster’s English Usage (1989) confirms that the stigma developed in the course of C20, and that infer was used quite freely in this way earlier on. \n The use of infer for imply may well be a hypercorrection generated by the fine reciprocal line that has been drawn between them. (The same problem besets other reciprocal pairs like substitute/replace and comprise/compose.) Imply is much more common than infer according to the evidence of English databases everywhere (by a factor of 4:1 in BNC data). Their patterns of distribution are also very different. Imply occurs freely in speech and writing, across all genres of discourse, while infer is strongly associated with the more formal styles of bureaucratic, legal or academic prose, and scarce in speech. The relative rarity of infer suggests that its use where the “rule” requires imply is a sign of writers/speakers overzealous about correctness, reaching beyond the word that comes easily. \n Another complicating factor noted by Webster’s English Usage is the logical use of infer with a nonpersonal subject, meaning “indicate” or “have or lead to as a conclusion,” a use which originated more than four centuries ago, according to the Oxford. Though rare, it’s acknowledged in contemporary dictionaries, and exemplified in database evidence such as:  \n The witness gave evidence which inferred that Drew was a violent man. \n This use of infer stands between the reciprocal uses of imply and infer distinguished above, and overlaps with the use of imply with a personal subject. The shift from nonpersonal use of infer (“indicate”) to personal use as “imply” is no great move, as the examples show. In conversation and debate many people do not distinguish between these constructions; and in context it’s usually quite clear whether infer is intended to mean making an active suggestion (=“imply”), or a deduction made from something else. As often, the distinction is more important in writing, and writers may be reassured by the general facts of usage outlined above: that the word they need most of the time is imply. Like other shibboleths of language, the issue needs to be defused. (See further under shibboleth.)"

Only by analysing the composition of words can we tell which prefix is there. Doubt as to which prefix is there lies at the heart of the problem with inflammable (see further under flammable). \n In both sets of words, the im- form is used regularly before “b”, “m” and “p”. The in- form goes with any other consonants except “l” and “r,” where the prefixes are il- (as in illegal, illuminate) and ir- (as in irrational, irrigate).

In some cases such as in-/unarguable and in-/unsanitary there are regional differences (see inarguable, insanitary). In others, the prefix is fixed by a mixture of history and convention. The in- prefix is from Latin and generally goes with Latin formations, while un- is Old English and goes with English formations, even when the same root is involved. So we have: \n incomplete vs uncompleted \n indiscriminate vs undiscriminating \n inedible vs uneatable \n Other points to note from these examples are that the English un- is often prefixed to words ending in -ed, -ing, -able, whereas the Latin in- heads words ending in -te, -ible and -ent, (i)al, -ive, -ous. For the choice between impractical and unpractical, see under practical or practicable. \n Note finally the special sets of Latin adjectives which do not use in-, but rather un-, dis- or non-:  \n unimaginative unindustrious \n  unintelligent unintentional \n disincentive disinfectant \n disingenuous disintegrate \n nonimperialist nonindigenous \n noninfectious nonintoxicating \n For some of the dis- words, it’s arguable that the prefix dis- is needed to express reversal rather than straight negation (see further under dis-). But in all those examples the complicating factor is that the stem begins with in-, and to prefix the negative in- would be distracting (‘inintelligent,” “iningenuous,” “ininfectious”). The use of un-, dis-, non- helps to dissimilate the prefix from the stem. See further under dissimilate or dissimulate."

In neither is the action directly contingent on the in case clause. The prepositional phrase in case of can be used to express both contingent and open conditions. Compare: \n In case of fire, do not use the lift. (contingent) \n  Bring an umbrella in case of rain. (open) \n The familiar official warning of the first sentence urges action in the event of a fire (i.e. contingent on one), whereas the second is quite open: you should take an umbrella whatever the weather. In British English contingent uses of in case of are largely formulaic – in case of need/accident or injury / damage to property – and their contingent meaning is often underscored by “only”:  \n . . . go out only in case of necessity \n In American English in case of is used freely in contingent and in open conditions, so that it’s possible to say: \n Bring an umbrella in case of rain. (open) \n In case of rain the game will take place on April 18. (contingent) \n The two uses are usually distinguishable by the internal logic of the sentence, but the second is much less familiar to the British, and they may mistake it when it occurs in mid-sentence, as in the following from American newspapers: \n Children would be sent home from school in case of nuclear disaster.  \n . . . hostages to execute in case of an American attack \n . . . with the consent of both parents (the custodial parent in case of a divorce) \n American English, though it is not yet acknowledged in Webster’s Third (1986). For example: \n The machine should be turned off in case the red light comes on. \n The sentence makes no sense as an open condition – you would never turn the machine on! But as a contingent condition it is eminently sensible. All this highlights a discrepancy in usage, a point on which American writers must beware, and British readers might recognize that British English is somewhat circumscribed. The conjunction lest provides an unambiguous alternative (see lest). \n The phrase in the case of is often censured in style manuals as wordy and overused. In academic prose it’s overrepresented, according to the Longman Grammar (1999), but less evident in other kinds of writing. Academics may defend it on the grounds that it serves to signal a change of topic in complex discourse, as in the following sentence: \n In the case of that abusive letter, I would ignore it. \n This upfront use of in the case of makes it a topicalizing device, a means of spotlighting an item in a series of sentences that would otherwise submerge it.

Both derive from Latin inchoatus, earlier incohatus, meaning “just begun” or “hitched up” (cohum being the word for a yoke strap). In legal usage inchoate refers to a preliminary offense, such as incitement or conspiracy; and to a document which is not yet made specific and operative. In the latter usage it effectively means “not valid,” and its legal opposite choate, used of a valid document (choate lien), confirms that the prefix is understood as a negative rather than an intensive (see further under in-/im-). In general usage inchoate also seems to be somewhat misunderstood. It is used tautologically as in “inchoate beginnings,” and as if the stem had something to do with chaos, hence the sense “disorganized, confused, chaotic,” as in apparently orderly systems become inchoate, disorderly. This sense is questioned in some dictionaries, but accepted straightforwardly in others such as Webster’s Third (1986) and New Oxford (1998). (See further under folk etymology.) \n Inchoative is used by grammarians to refer to verbal structures that express the notion of an action beginning.

		"title": "incredible or incredulous",
		"explanation":"In formal English, only a person can be incredulous (i.e. “unable to believe something”), whereas facts and events are incredible (i.e. “unable to be believed”). An Australian television series about bizarre happenings was titled That’s incredible! But exclamatory usage like this can also be applied to people, as in You’re incredible, where incredible means roughly “amazing or extraordinary,” though its connotations of intense surprise outweigh any particular denotation. This sense of that which is “beyond what one might have conceived as possible” is quietly acknowledged in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), though labeled “informal” in New Oxford (1998). In BNC data, this use of incredible is much more frequent than the restrained sense, in both written and spoken sources. The writing that presents it is typically interactive and sometimes extravagant, witness: \n  On the windward side you will reach an area of incredible beauty. \n . . . the incredible production rate at United Biscuits \n I had been presented with an incredible opportunity. \n The shows in New York were incredible. \n Like other words used to express attitude, incredible is becoming increasingly uninformative, and leans on others for specific meaning. In easy-going discourse this is no problem, but it doesn’t earn its keep in tightly worded prose. \n Attitudinal use is also very common with the adverb incredibly, in interactive and affective narrative: \n They were incredibly strong. \n I felt incredibly tired. \n Again the word has little denotation, and becomes no more than a rather bulky intensifier.

The reasons are natural enough. Apart from the fact that the prefixes in- and en- have alternated for centuries in English words (see en-/in-), en- is the usual prefix in the much more common (and deceptively similar) words encumber and encumbrance. In fact incumbent and encumber have quite separate histories. Incumbent is formed out of the Latin verb meaning “lean upon,” while encumber derives from French and means roughly “obstruct.” Yet as the incumbent of an office, you may be encumbered with particular duties, and this coincidence no doubt encourages the identification of the two words."

Both indention and indentation refer to the practice of indenting: leaving a space at the beginning of a line of print. Indention is the more widely used term, endorsed in the Chicago Manual (2003), the Australian government Style Manual (2002), and in the UK by Butcher’s Copy-editing (1992), although the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) prefers indentation. (For more about indenting practices, see indents.) \n The term indenture was originally applied to legal contracts contained in documents with identical notches cut into the edge. The uniqueness of the notches was intended to prevent false copies of the document being drawn up. Nowadays indenture is still a contract or agreement (especially between an employer and an apprentice), but the documents are no longer notched."

The standard indent for paragraphs is 1 or 2 ems, varying with the length of the line. For line lengths over 26 picas, the longer indent is needed. \n Regular indenting may be suspended in certain circumstances: \n 1 In textbooks and reference works, the line immediately following a heading or subheading is often not indented, but set flush with the left margin. This practice is noted in the Chicago Manual (1993) as well as the Oxford Guide to Style (2002), as is its use at the beginning of a chapter. Yet the decision is partly a matter of looks, and needs to be coordinated with the size and placement of the headings: are they centred, flush with the left margin, or indented? Daily newspapers indent the first line under both headlines and subheadlines. \n 2 The first line of a block quotation is not usually indented, provided it’s clearly set off from the main body of the text, either by italics, or change of type size, or by block indenting. \n 3 In fully blocked letter format. See under letter writing, and Appendix VII.) \n Hanging indention is the reverse of regular indention: the first line is flush with the left margin, and the second and subsequent lines in the same unit are all indented 1 em, as a block. Note that while hanging indention is the term used by British editors (Butcher, 1992), it’s flush-and-hang in the Chicago Manual. The technique is often used in lists and indexes (see indexing section 2); and sometimes for setting out a series of points in the body of a text. The runover/turnover lines are also indented. \n 1. xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx \n 2. yyyyyyyyyyyy yyyyyyyyyyyyyy \n In statistical tables, hanging indents are used in the stub for runover/turnover lines of subheadings.

		"title": "indexing",
		"explanation":"An index is an asset for almost any nonfiction book whose material is not already presented in alphabetical order. It helps both committed readers and browsers to access the book’s fine detail, and is always a useful complement to the table of contents or chapter headings. By convention and convenience it’s the last section of the book – since it cannot be started until the rest of the book has been paginated. The index is usually set in slightly smaller type than the main text (e.g. 2 points smaller), and usually in double columns, unless the book is in large format, in which case it may be in three or four columns on a page. Indexes tend to be longer and more detailed in academic and technical books, and may indeed be specialized for particular aspects of the book. Hence the varieties of index such as: Index of Names and Places, and Subject Index etc. as well as the General Index. Whenever there’s more than one index, the most comprehensive one goes last. \n The labor of making the index may fall to the author of a book, or be done by the publisher or a professional indexer. Indexing software is increasingly available for personal computers, which can be used by anyone. But creating the index raises a number of questions. \n  What items should be entered in the index? The aim is to cover all the key concepts and terms used, as well as any specific references which readers might look for. The indexer needs to anticipate the nontechnical terms which browsers might use as their first port of call in the index. Established synonyms for concepts (and synonymous phrases), and alternative official and personal names will need to be entered. Crossreferencing within the entries should allow the reader to move from the specific to the general and vice versa. At the same time, the index should enable the reader to get information about a topic in one place, as far as possible. \n 2 How should index entries be set? There are two established methods for presenting the entries: \n ∗ broken off \n ∗ run in or run on (the first term is American style, the second British) \n The methods differ in the way they treat subentries. The broken-off method has each subentry on a separate line, indented 1 em and with turnovers indented 2 ems. The run-in/run-on method blocks all subentries together, indented 1 em, with individual subitems separated by a semicolon: \n broken off \n  brackets 102–6 \n curly brackets 105 \n round brackets (parentheses) 102–4 \n  slash brackets 104 \n square brackets (in mathematics) 106, (in linguistics) 105 \n run in/on \n brackets 102–6; curly brackets 105; round brackets (parentheses) 102–4; slash brackets 104; square brackets (in mathematics) 106, (in linguistics) 105 \n On the matter of page spans, see numbers and number style section 1. As the examples show, the run-in/run-on method takes less space, requires fewer word breaks, and is easy to set. It is however less easy for the reader to consult. The broken-off method always takes more space, especially if used for subentries as well as sub-subentries, when the text contracts to the right-hand side of the column. In some indexes the two methods are combined, with broken-off setting used for subentries, while sub-subentries within them are run in/on. \n 3 Should the indexed words be alphabetized letter-by-letter or word-by-word ? These alternatives are discussed at alphabetical order. The letter-by-letter system is more straightforward for the indexer or computer to produce. However the reader will locate entries more easily if word-by-word order is used, especially when there are many closely related words."

		"title": "Indian",
		"explanation":"This adjective reflects the old Persian word Hind for India (see further under Hindi and Hindu), and, unqualified, the word’s primary reference is still – in most contexts – to the Indian subcontinent and its culture and people. In British English, this is certainly so. \n The word Indian has however been applied to other peoples in many parts of the globe. During the European colonial era, it was used of the natives of the East Indies, and of indigenous peoples in the Philippines. In the same way the Spanish used Indianos to refer to the indigenous peoples of the American continent, though this is often explained by the tradition that Columbus believed his first landfall in the Caribbean actually was the East Indies. The inhabitants of the West Indies are of course still West Indians. The English too used Indian for the indigenous people of North and South America, usually with some qualifying word as in Plains Indians, Amazonian Indians, Mexican Indians. The term Red Indians is also a relic of this, though it smacks of frontier fiction and the Hollywood western. \n Within the US, native American Indians use the simple term Indian as a means of affirming their distinctive culture and social practices. This facilitates its use without qualification in American English generally, in official terms like Indian reservation, Indian lands, Indian rights. Indian boarding schools were those to which American Indian children were consigned under earlier government policies of relocation and reacculturation. In Canada the term Indian stands alongside Inuit and Metis, as a way of identifying the three First Peoples. Canadian legislation also distinguishes between the Status Indians (also called Registered or Treaty Indians) and the so-called Non-Status Indians. Against those bureaucratic constructs, Canadian Indians not unnaturally prefer to use their Aboriginal group names. The term Amerindian refers to the original inhabitants of any part of the Americas: North, South and Central. \n International English has just a few stock phrases in which the simple adjective Indian refers to North American Indians. They include Indian corn i.e. maize, Indian file (walk in single file as did American Indians on the move), and Indian summer. This phrase is recorded at regular intervals in C19 America as a way of referring to a period of sunny, stable but often hazy weather at the end of autumn. It is explained through the fact that such weather was typical of the inland areas then inhabited by American Indians, which differed from the changeable cool climate of the coasts settled by Europeans."

		"title": "indict or indite",
		"explanation":"In Middle English indite was the spelling for two different verbs, meaning: \n ∗ “compose or write a literary work” \n ∗ “bring a legal charge against [someone]” \n The c was introduced into indict for the legal verb around 1600, as a way of distinguishing it from the other, and as a visual link with its Latin forebear indictare. The pronunciation has never adjusted to the changed spelling (as with some other respellings of the English Renaissance: see spelling, rules and reform section 1). \n Both indict and the related noun indictment continue to be used in law, and outside it, to mean “condemn/ation,” as in: \n a terrible indictment of all those involved in the whaling industry \n Meanwhile indite (“compose”) has become obsolete. The Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) last citation was from 1800, apart from two (probably archaistic) instances from the pen of Disraeli. With the start of C21, it’s time to reappraise the anomalous spelling of indict, given that the need for it has disappeared with the death of the other word. We could well accept the verdict of history, and allow indict to revert to indite, in keeping with its pronunciation. In doing so we’d rid English of one more trap for the unwary."

		"title": "indigenous or Indigenous",
		"explanation":"This word is sensitive for socio-political reasons in English-speaking countries such as Canada and Australia, and now needs a capital letter for some applications. Both Canadian English Usage (1997) and the Australian government Style Manual (2002) advise this when the term refers to the original habitants of the continent and their descendants, as in Indigenous people(s) in Canada, Indigenous Australians. In the same way the phrase Indigenous peoples is used to refer to the first inhabitants of lands anywhere in the world, as in land rights of Indigenous peoples. The capital letter accords with its use in related ethnic terms such as Aboriginal, and, in Canada, Native. See further under capital letters section 1. \n But in its generic senses (“original,” “belonging to the place”), indigenous needs no capital: \n Changes to their habitat threaten many indigenous species of bird. \n Occasionally the presence/absence of the capital is critical to meaning. See for example, indigenous publishing in Australia (by locally owned publishers – not multinational), which contrasts with Indigenous publishing (publishing by Aboriginal groups)."

However the genetic relationship with even the more remote branches, such as Celtic and Indo-Iranian, can be seen when you line up their basic vocabulary. The numbers used for counting in each language provide the most striking evidence of common origin.

Inducement is an everyday term for circumstances (material, financial, psychological, political) that motivate or provide an incentive for a particular action, as in: \n The railways secured huge government land grants as an inducement to build. \n Despite every inducement, the anxious shag could not be persuaded to get its feet wet. \n In the practice of law, inducement is also a technical term for the explanatory material that prefaces the pleading of a case.

		"title": "induction",
		"explanation":"This is the process of reasoning whereby we draw a general proposition or generalization from a series of instances or examples. The inductive process underlies much everyday communication, and is easily seen in newspaper headlines such as: \n RENTS ON THE RISE IN BIRMINGHAM \n A generalization like that is presumably based on evidence gathered by the reporter, and we read on to see what it was. As in that case, the generalization is often stated before the examples that support it. The soundness of the generalization depends on whether it’s based on plenty of examples, and on how representative they are. If the headline above was based on a few prices quoted by two estate agents (realtors) in two suburbs of Birmingham, it’s potentially misleading and a rash generalization. \n Inductive generalizations both rash and reasonable are made all the time as people exchange ideas and information. Not often are they “perfect” inductions, i.e. ones based on all instances or entities which lend themselves to it. Even a perfect induction can only be said to support a general proposition, not to prove it in the philosophical sense of guaranteeing its truth. \n Modern science owes a great deal to inductive reasoning, and it’s the foundation of scientific method. Scientific laws are induced from recurrent instances of natural behavior, or tested and confirmed by them. In fact induction is the only logical way to validate many a statement. If someone says, Ash trees grow best in open settings, the only way to verify the statement is by seeking instances in which this is so, as well as ones in which the opposite holds (e.g. where the tree suffers in dense vegetation). Statements like that, whose validity must be tested inductively are called synthetic statements; whereas statements which are self-validating (i.e. true by virtue of the way they are formulated) are analytic statements. An example of the latter is No maiden aunt is an only child. Analytic statements are also a kind of tautology. \n ♦ Compare deduction."

Its older denotations of persistent and energetic application to a task are embodied in industrious meaning “hard-working,” established in English five centuries ago. Industrial implies a connection with industry in its more recent sense of a manufacturing concern or branch of business. It probably reflects French use of industriel, and found ready application in the impacts of the industrial revolution, from late C18 on. Two centuries later industrial is very much more common than industrious, outnumbering it by almost 1000:1 in BNC data. The distance between industrious and industrial is clear in the ironic fact that industrial action means something other than industrious behavior on the part of the workers concerned."

		"explanation":"This suffix appears on both adjectives and nouns in English, with variable pronunciation and some variation in its spelling. As an adjective ending it’s used to mean “made of,” as in crystalline, or “associated with,” as in tangerine (a fruit originally imported from Tangier). The examples show two of the possible pronunciations for this suffix in English, to rhyme with “wine” or “wean.” As a noun ending -ine has a minor role marking the feminine form of some masculine names, as in Josephine and Pauline. The latter shows a third pronunciation, rhyming with “win.” \n In C21 English the spelling -ine varies with -in in the names of certain household chemicals, notably: \n gelatin(e) glycerin(e) \n  lanolin(e) saccharin(e) \n Americans prefer -in for all, by both dictionary and database evidence – except when saccharine serves as an adjective (“sugary”), as in a handful of saccharine songs. The British agree on lanolin and on the different applications of saccharin/saccharine; but they like to see -ine in gelatine and glycerine as well (see under gelatin, and glycerin). Australian preferences are like the British (Peters, 1995), whereas Canadians come closer to Americans in using -in for gelatin: see Canadian Oxford (1998). \n The use of -ine and -in was standardized for professional chemists in C19 by A. W. von Hofmann, whose classification was published in Watts’s Dictionary of Chemistry (1866) and subsequently adopted by the Chemical Society. Hofmann reserved the -ine spelling for alkaloids and organic bases, such as: \n caffeine morphine quinine strychnine \n He assigned -in to neutral substances (including glucosides, glycerides and proteids): \n albumin gasolin gelatin globolin glycerin \n But Hofmann’s system stands less clearly than it might (especially for the nonchemist), because -ine and -in have other uses in chemistry. A number of chemical elements (the so-called “halogens”) are spelled -ine: \n bromine chlorine fluorine iodine \n Meanwhile -in is the ending of a number of enzymes and hormones: \n adrenalin insulin pepsin rennin \n and of some well-known drugs and pharmaceutical products, such as: \n aspirin penicillin streptomycin \n Chemists of course have specialist knowledge and access to chemical formulas which would resolve any question about the suffix. For ordinary users, they are simply fixed elements of the spelling. \n For two household chemicals, -ine varies with -ene: both gasoline and gasolene, kerosine and kerosene are registered in dictionaries. American, Canadian and Australian dictionaries all prefer gasoline for the first and kerosene for the second, and database evidence bears them out – however arbitrary that seems. Contemporary preferences in Britain run the same way, by the evidence of the BNC. Yet the Oxford Dictionary (1989) prefers -ene spellings in both cases. It gives gasolene priority over gasoline, apparently for historical reasons; and kerosene is preferred on the basis of common usage, although kerosine has official backing from technical bodies in Britain and America (British Institute of Petroleum, American Society for Testing Materials, and the American Standards Association). Fortunately the choice of -ine or -ene makes no chemical difference for gasoline and kerosene, whereas with benzine/benzene and fluorene/fluorine it does. See further under those headings."

Garner (1998) argues for a shift to inferable since mid-C20, and what little evidence there is in the BNC would support this. Neither inferible nor inferrible appears in BNC or CCAE, nor is there any historical justification for such latinized or “mongrel” forms, as the Oxford calls them. Why not keep the word English? (See further at -able/-ible.) But both BNC and CCAE provide instances of inferrable, which correlates with the more straightforward pronunciation of the word, stressing the second syllable as for inferred and inferring, and reflected in the doubled r (see doubling of final consonant). \n Either inferrable or inferable could be justified, depending on whether its stress is like that of inferring or inference.

		"explanation":"The basic nonfinite forms of verbs such as (to) ask, (to) go, (to) decide are called infinitives.

The infinitives of the second column are then the to-infinitives, whenever the two kinds have to be distinguished. Alongside simple infinitives such as those, compound infinitives such as the perfect infinitive can be formed with have, and the passive infinitive with be: \n I wouldn’t have gone I’d like to have gone (perfect) \n you will be asked you have to be asked (passive) \n Here again the examples show that infinitives are not necessarily formed with to. Historically it was not part of the infinitive, but was formally attached to it in C18 grammars. Not so surprisingly, the anxiety about split infinitives dates from the following century. See further under that heading. \n 1 Infinitives in other kinds of phrase. The infinitive serves as complement to words of other classes than verbs: \n ∗ adjectives eager to please easy to undo ready to go sure to fly. \n ∗ nouns, especially abstract nouns which embody verbal ideas: \n decision to leave \n desire to come \n invitation to abscond \n and indefinite or general nouns: \n moment to catch \n someone to love \n something to remember \n  time to reflect \n way to go \n Yet another role of the infinitive is to serve instead of a verbal noun as the noun phrase/subject of a finite clause: \n To err is human. \n 2 Infinitives in nonfinite clauses. In their combinations with modal and catenative verbs (will ask, wanted to ask), infinitives create one of the most familiar types of nonfinite clause. Infinitive clauses formed with to-infinitives are very common in fiction, according to the Longman Grammar (1999), especially with verbs such as want, try, seem, begin. Want to and try to are also the commonest catenatives in news reporting and conversation, whereas it’s seem to in academic prose. \n Beyond these complementary uses of infinitives, they also form quasi-adverbial nonfinite clauses that formulate a purpose: \n We walked fast to beat the rain. \n The teachers brought bags to collect the bottles. \n In more formal styles, the to is sometimes expanded into in order to or so as to, but most of the time the infinitive with to says it all. \n ♦ See further under modality, catenatives and nonfinite clause."

		"title": "inflectional extras",
		"explanation":"One small point of divergence between British and American English grammar lies in British preference for giving someone’s years as aged 16 where Americans would have age 16. The British form is inflected like an adjective (see further under -ed section 2), while the American stands like an ordinary numerical compound, as in grade 7 student (see hyphens section 2c). \n This difference affects numerous compound adjectives ending in -ed. In British English they are normally inflected, in American English not so. For example: \n ∗ -ed British: fine-toothed, golden-haired, mattfinished, snub-nosed, spine-tailed, 10-roomed (house) American: fine-tooth, golden-hair, matt-finish, snub-nose, spine-tail, 10-room \n It also affects noun compounds with descriptive modifiers. Compare: \n ∗ -ed British: barbed wire, iced tea, skimmed milk, striped shirt American: barb wire, ice tea, skim milk, stripe shirt \n ∗ -ing British: dialling tone, diving school, sailing boat, sparking plug American: dial tone, dive school, sail boat, spark plug \n Another inflectional extra of some British compound expressions but not the American counterparts is the plural −s.Where the British use antiques shop, drugs overdose, departures lounge etc., Americans have antique shop, drug overdose, departure lounge. Those used to the British forms tend to find the American ones curt, although some of them are being adopted in the UK. For those used to the American, the British seem a tad rococo. \n Similar differences emerge in pairs such as cookery book / cook book, where British English uses a derivational suffix and the American has none. (See further under suffixes.) Different conventions for dates, where the British use ordinals (11th September) and Americans use cardinals (September 11), again show the British preference for suffixes. \n ♦ for more on the writing of dates, see under that heading."

		"explanation":"Inflections are the suffixes which add particular grammatical meanings to words of a particular class (nouns, verbs etc.).

The most familiar ones are: \n ∗ for nouns \n -’s possessive/genitive \n -(e)s plural (see further under plurals) \n ∗ for verbs \n -(e)s 3rd person singular, present tense \n -ing continuous/imperfect aspect \n -ed past tense / perfect aspect (see further under irregular verbs) \n ∗ for adjectives and adverbs \n -er comparative \n -est superlative \n they effectively form new words.

		"title": "inflicted or afflicted",
		"explanation":"In passive constructions inflicted is sometimes substituted for afflicted (not the other way round). This is not hard to explain, given the fact that: \n ∗ they are similarly pronounced, differing only in the first unstressed syllable \n ∗ their meanings can be almost reciprocal. Compare: \n the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians \n the plagues with which he afflicted the Egyptians \n ∗ both inflicted and afflicted imply negative forces beyond one’s control \n ∗ inflict once meant afflict. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) has citations from C16 and C17, but notes its rarity with one from C19. \n Though far from common, the BNC does contain examples where inflicted appears for afflicted, as in citizens had been inflicted with uncanny storms that ripped tiles from roof. The combination “inflicted with” is the sign of interference between the two constructions, since inflicted is normally complemented by on, and afflicted by with (or by). But the odd combination hints at supernatural forces punishing the uninsured householder – like the unwary Egyptians."

		"title": "informal style",
		"explanation":"We typically use an informal style when talking impromptu with others. It consists of relaxed, easy-going language and ordinary colloquialisms rather than scholarly or academic words: put up with rather than “tolerate” or “endure”; get rather than “purchase”; trim rather than “abbreviate.” Concrete examples and images come more naturally than abstractions: tool rather than “implement”; job rather than “appointment”; date rather than “engagement.” Abbreviated forms of words, such as mike for “microphone” and TV for “television” are natural elements of an informal style, as are contracted forms of phrases, such as: I’m, they’re, wasn’t. The informal style allows free and frequent ellipsis of the standard grammatical elements of a clause, so that sentences may be no more than: \n Don’t know. A great idea. To show the flag. \n Because informal language is associated with conversation, its overtones are friendly and expansive, sometimes offhanded. A hundred years ago, informal style would hardly have appeared in writing, except in the dialogue of novels, and informal language was almost synonymous with incorrect language. Nowadays informal features of style are seen as useful resources if used in moderation, especially for writers who want to avoid putting unnecessary distance between themselves and their readers. A few informal touches can help to ensure this, without undermining the purpose of the document or letter. One would of course avoid referring to grave or seriously contentious matters in an informal way. As always, it’s a matter of deciding on the appropriate level of formality/informality for the item concerned. See further under formal words."

		"title": "information focus",
		"explanation":"One of the arts of writing is keeping the reader with you. Amid the flow of words, readers can be distracted or diverted onto marginal things and miss the intended point or emphasis. Not all words in any text are equally important. Those which embody its themes need to stand out against those which are simply the ordinary medium. \n There are several ways of spotlighting a word or words in an English sentence. It can be done by means of a focusing device, such as only, even, also, too, as well. For example: \n He wished only to publicize the problem. (not to deal with it) \n They had even brought the phone book with them. (How well prepared can you be!) \n Less marked versions of the second sentence would be: \n They had also brought the phone book. \n They had brought the phone book too. \n They had brought the phone book as well. \n As the examples show, the focusing words sometimes go before and sometimes after the one in the spotlight. Too and as well usually follow it, whereas the others usually precede. (For more about the position of only, see under that heading.) A bifocal spotlight can be achieved when also and only combine in the correlatives not only . . . but also, drawing attention to two things of equal importance in parallel structures. \n There are less dramatic but more pervasive ways of using English sentence order to provide a particular focus. The reading of any sentence is affected and framed by whatever it begins with, and the effect is cumulative. In a detective narrative, many a sentence will begin by referring to the hero: \n Bond opened the door slowly. He stepped cautiously into the room . . . \n The repeated and prominent mention of the hero naturally focuses the reader’s attention on him. Nonfiction writers can use the start of a sentence to draw attention to a new focus: \n From then on, he presents problems rather than solutions. \n Thus skilled writers of both fiction and nonfiction use their sentence openings strategically, to establish, maintain and change the focus. (See further under topic and dangling participles.) Both phrases and subordinate clauses at the start of a sentence may help to refocus the reader’s attention. See for example: \n If any further action is required, we will call a meeting. \n Though grammatically subordinate, the clause becomes prominent in its prime position in that sentence. For more about subordinate clauses, see clauses sections 3 and 4."

		"title": "informer or informant",
		"explanation":"Being similar in meaning and form, these words are sometimes substituted for each other. But because the connotations of informer are unpleasant, it’s an unfortunate choice of words where the context is meant to be neutral. \n Informer has been used for centuries (since early C16) to refer to someone who gives information to legal authorities against another person. The more recent word informant was also used this way for about 100 years until later C19. But its common use nowadays is to refer to someone who gives information in response to an inquiry, whether solicited in a casual encounter (e.g. Which way to the station? ), or in the name of social and linguistic research. Informant is definitely the one to use if you wish to avoid depreciating the help received."

		"title": "-ing",
		"explanation":"This familiar suffix is found on English verbs, adjectives and nouns. For all verbs, regular and irregular, it serves to form the present participle, and appears in many a compound verb: \n it was wandering \n they had been whistling \n These -ing forms have long been seconded from the verb to work as adjectives: \n a wandering albatross \n a whistling kettle \n In [heard] the kettle whistling for all it was worth, the -ing word may be seen as adjectival (introducing an adjectival phrase) or participial (introducing a nonfinite clause), depending on your grammar. (See further under phrases and nonfinite clause.) \n The same -ing suffix forms verbal nouns in English: \n Its whistling interrupted the conversation. \n The fact that the verbal noun and adjective/participle are identical has caused a remarkable amount of anxiety in the last 200 years, over constructions in which it could be interpreted as either: \n They heard the kettle whistling. (participle) \n They heard the kettle’s whistling. (noun) \n (For more about this controversy, see under gerund and gerundive.) \n Verbal nouns have been readily formed in English with -ing since C13, before suffixes borrowed from French and Latin such as -al, -ance, -ation, -ence, -ment were put to the purpose. The long history of -ing words has allowed many of them to develop distinctive meanings, shifting away from the verbs on which they are based to materials used in the process, or the object of the process: \n bedding clothing drawing \n dwelling icing mooring \n roofing scaffolding seasoning \n stuffing \n This transition into full nouns is most obvious when the -ing becomes plural, as in: \n diggings earnings findings \n innings lodgings makings \n savings shavings surroundings \n takings \n The -ing suffix is set solid except when attached to a short word ending in -o. In cases like to-ing and fro-ing, the hyphen helps to ensure that they are read as two syllables."

		"title": "ingenuous or ingenious",

Ingenious means “inventive, clever,” while ingenuous implies simplicity and a lack of guile or circumspection, so that it can mean “naive” as in ingenuous acceptance of the contract, or “candid” as in an ingenuous smile. Ingenious is far more common than ingenuous, by a factor of more than 10:1 in British English, by the evidence of the BNC. \n The opposite of ingenuous is disingenuous, whose connotations are usually negative. A disingenuous apology is felt to be false or feigned, and a disingenuous proposal is seen as devious, and not be taken at face value. A disingenuous proposal might nevertheless be seen as ingenious, by those who thought that the end justified the means. \n The noun ingenuity goes with ingenious in terms of meaning, in spite of its original link with ingenuous. Ingenuity has in fact meant “inventiveness” since C17. A new abstract noun had to be found for ingenuous, and ingenuousness (“naivety”) has been in use since C18."

		"title": "inoculate",
		"explanation":"This word was originally a technical term in horticulture, meaning to “engraft a bud into another plant.” But it has long been used in medicine, to refer to the practice of immunizing people against a disease, using a dead or weakened virus. In earlier C18, inoculate simply implied scratching the patient’s skin to implant the protective virus, the technique which Edward Jenner perfected in 1796. The virus used by Jenner was derived from infected cows and called a vaccine (vacca being Latin for “cow”) – hence the term vaccination. \n In C19 medical practices, both inoculate and vaccinate came to be applied to any process of immunization that implants a protective form of a virus in a patient, whether by scratching the skin, injecting it under pressure, or consuming it orally. \n The different spellings of inoculate and innocuous (“harmless”) reflect their separate origins. Inoculate embodies the prefix in- (“in, into”) and Latin oculus meaning “eye” or “bud”; while innocuous means “not nocuous or noxious,” involving the negative prefix in-. (See further under in-/im-.) But they impinge on each other in so far as inoculations can ensure that future attacks of the disease will be innocuous."

	{
		"title": "inquire or enquire, and inquiry or enquiry",
		"explanation":"The English-speaking world is at sixes and sevens over the use of these spellings. Some writers use both, giving them different applications: others simply use inquiry (and inquire) at all times. The distinction maintained by some is that inquiry/inquire refer to formal and organized investigations, whereas enquiry/enquire are used of single and personal questions. This division of labor was endorsed by Fowler (1926), but gains no support in the Oxford Dictionary (1989) which simply presents the two spellings as equal alternatives ( inquire, enquire; inquiry, enquiry in that order) for all meanings. New Oxford (1998) distances itself from both Fowler’s position and that of the big Oxford, proposing instead that there are regional differences, associating the enforms with British English, and the in- forms with American. This squares better with actual usage in the US than the UK. American data from CCAE shows that inquire and inquiry are strongly preferred, and used in 97% and 88% of instances respectively. The facts correlate well with Webster’s Third (1986), which makes inquire and inquiry the primary spellings, and enquire/enquiry the also-rans. \n British data from the BNC presents a complex picture, with enquire outnumbering inquire by 2:1, while inquiry outnumbers enquiry in the same ratio. The paradox could be explained by Fowler’s semantic distinction, if the verb was more often used for personal/individual questions (=enquire), and the noun for nonpersonal/institutional applications of the word (= inquiry). Closer inspection of BNC citations shows that the spellings often seem to reflect the Fowlerian distinction, but it doesn’t capture the full range of usage. On the one hand there are examples with enquire applied to questions which are societal and intellectual: a [legal] duty to enquire; enquire about prisoners of conscience; Aristotle did not enquire into the mental process. On the other, inquire is sometimes used for the strictly personal questions: he doesn’t inquire into what it involved; there was no need to humble herself and inquire if he had returned to work. And though inquiry is regularly used of official investigations, enquiry sometimes turns up there unexpectedly, as in Committee of Enquiry, Maria Colewell Enquiry. Burchfield (1996) also presents nonconforming examples. So while many British writers practice what Fowler preached, some use the two spellings interchangeably, as the Oxford still allows. \n Elsewhere in the world, there are further intricacies. Australians seem to use inquire/enquire interchangeably, but official and house-style dictated uses of inquiry make it much the more common in print (Peters, 1995). Canadians prefer inquire, but use both inquiry and enquiry, the latter used particularly for intellectual endeavors as in scientific enquiry (Fee and McAlpine, 1997). In fact it’s unnecessary to differentiate the spelling for particular applications, because the context normally clarifies what kind of investigation or question is at stake. \n Neither inquiry nor enquiry represents the original form of this word in English. It was borrowed from French as enquery/enquere, and was then gradually respelled under Latin influence in C14 and C15. Enquiry represents a halfway stage, while in inquiry the latinization of the root is complete. Uncertainty about its spelling has no doubt been perpetuated by the general vacillation over en- and in-. See further under en-/in-. \n International English selection: Given no consistent ways of differentiating the two spellings, and the fact that differentiation is unnecessary, it makes sense to consolidate the use of one or the other. Inquire and inquiry recommend themselves as the spellings made first among equals by the Oxford Dictionary, and the fact that they are strongly preferred in North America."

For example: \n Northern’s faster pack made ever greater inroads. \n We all know what inroads a big family makes. \n The particle following is usually into, as in made inroads into Soviet universities. \n  With inroad the collocation with make is less strong – used in about 60% of citations – and the word is more often postmodified: \n The inroad of foreign capital means some loss of independence. \n This case represents a major inroad on the exclusionary rule. \n As the examples show, inroad works as a legal and academic term, whereas inroads can go almost anywhere."

By origin it’s the plural of Latin insigne meaning “distinguishing mark,” first used in C17 English to refer to the badges of office. Latinists would prefer it to be used with a plural verb, as in no insignia were handed to the person ordained. But like other Latin loanwords ending in -a, it tends to become a collective noun in modern English (cf. bacteria, candelabra, data), helped by the fact that insignia take different forms in different institutions: \n Why is the Royal Victorian Order insignia decorated with a rose?  \n . . . [in camouflage] no rank insignia was visible \n Instances like these with singular agreement are commoner in BNC data than those with plural. In American English this process of anglicization has gone further, and the Webster’s Third (1986) entry for insignia allows the regular English plural insignias. CCAE data provide plenty of evidence for it, in examples such as baseball insignias, gang insignias, school insignias, military insignias – not to mention insignias of local motorcycle clubs, insignias from Pepsi, Merrill Lynch and Marlboro, and the three-arrowed insignias [used] for “recyclable.” In these various applications insignia has become a cover term for ordinary badges of membership and commercial logos, and much less exclusive in its implications."

In data from the BNC, install outnumbers instal by more than 40:1 (with most examples of instal coming from transcribed speech). The gap is almost four times greater in CCAE. Instal is thus rare in British English and hardly there at all in American. \n This contrasts interestingly with the fact that British writers strongly prefer the spelling instalment for all applications of the noun. In BNC data it outnumbers installment by more than 50:1. It is a relatively recent (C20) preference, since the original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) set them as equal alternatives. But New Oxford marks installment as “US”, suggesting the underlying reason for this polarization. Webster’s Third (1986) meanwhile gives priority to installment, and American writers in CCAE support it to the hilt. \n The British preference for instalment is shared by both Canadians and Australians, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Macquarie Dictionary (1997). Yet installment has much more to recommend it, being consistent with both the verb install and the other relevant abstract noun installation. \n ♦ Compare forestallment. \n International English selection: Installment is the spelling to prefer for the noun because of its consistency with the almost universal use of install for the verb."

While instantly is at home in both speech and writing, instantaneously is too bulky for casual conversation and much less common even in writing. But instantaneously carries the special sense of “happening only a split second afterwards,” and so emphasizes the close timing of two events: \n The pilot touched down and passengers cheered instantaneously \n Instantly often means just “straightaway,” as in: \n I’d go instantly if I had no appointment this afternoon. \n Thus instantly seems to be losing its sense of urgency, just like the adjective instant, in unremarkable things such as instant coffee and instant solutions."

		"title": "instill or instil",
		"explanation":"While Americans and Canadians prefer instill, British and Australian writers plump for instil. Yet the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) citations show that instil is a latter-day British spelling, first appearing in C19, with the hardening up of “rules” over final l. (See further under single for double.) Dr. Johnson used instill, which accords better with instillation and the word’s Latin stem instillare. Data from the BNC suggests that the changeover is still going on in the UK, where 1 in 7 are still using instill. Among American writers in CCAE, more than 99 in 100 use instill. The choice between instillment and instilment naturally turns on one’s spelling of the verb. \n The particle used after instil(l) is normally in everywhere in the world, with into coming a long way behind. The following examples from the BNC and CCAE show the common pattern: \n It’s the same reaction we want to instil in children. \n The fear these smugglers instill in people is incredible. \n But data from the corpora show much less convergence after instilled. British writers make almost as much use of instilled into as instilled in, and rather more use of instilled into in passive constructions such as: \n . . . the uncompromising principles instilled into her by her Quaker family \n Very occasionally instilled is followed by with – a faulty construction according to Fowler (1926) and some later usage commentators. Yet both BNC and CCAE provide examples of it such as: \n  . . . all members of a meritocracy. . . are instilled with ambition \n  . . . several humanitarian arms of the UN have been instilled with a sense of urgency. . . \n In passive constructions using with, the subject is typically human, and the particle following couldn’t be in or into. This is the alternative passive allowable with various ditransitive verbs which have both human and nonhuman objects (direct and indirect/prepositional; see predicate section 3). Fowler’s examples show he was concerned with “object shuffling” in active constructions, but his criticism has been overgeneralized as if with could never combine with the verb instil(l). Perhaps the insistence on using in or into owes something to the idea that the particle following a Latin verb should match the prefix (as argued for compared with and different from). At any rate passive use of instilled with is grammatically justifiable, and even the active instil(l) with seems to accord with dictionary definitions of it as “imbue” or “infuse” – though neither corpus provides any examples."

Instinctive is the older and much more common word, used since C17 to mean “prompted by instinct.” It’s often used of actions and feelings which are intuitive, as in an instinctive liking for her, where the instinct involved would be hard to identify. Instinctive is thus too ambiguous to serve the psychologists’ need for an adjective meaning simply “relating to human instincts” – hence the coining of instinctual in the 1920s. It remains the more academic and formal of the two words."

		"title": "institute or institution",

These are typically long-established entities, whereas more recent foundations in both the US and UK tend to use Institute, a trend noted by Fowler in the 1920s. This may be because institution also serves as a euphemism for a place of confinement, especially a mental asylum, as when someone is put in an institution. \n Yet institution maintains several other roles. It can refer to a familiar practice, as in:  \n Friday wine-tastings are an institution in their office. \n It also provides the abstract noun for the verb institute, as in: \n The institution of regular on-site meetings kept them better in touch with construction problems. \n Thirdly, institution is the generic word for organizations of all kinds, as in:  \n . . . a risky move for a financial institution  \n . . . dissatisfaction with Congress as an institution IMF officials don’t like to think of their institution in such terms. \n The family is in deep trouble as an institution This allows institution to be used as a paraphrase for Institute, as when speaking of the Women’s Institute as a nineteenth century institution."

Whereas intense is used to characterize individual behavior and attitudes, as in intense gaze and intense concentration. \n In intensive care we would of course hope to find that the patient is keenly watched by the nurse. But from the hospital’s point of view it’s a matter of the constancy of medical monitoring, rather than periodic visits by the nurse, as in other wards."

		"title": "intensifiers, amplifiers and emphasizers",
		"explanation":"An intensifier is an adjective or adverb (word or phrase) which amplifies the force of others, pushing them further up (or down) a notional scale. The most familiar example is very, as in a very good product – which is clearly better than a good product. Very is thus a booster, according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985), rather than a maximizer like absolute(ly), complete(ly), extreme(ly), utter(ly), which push the reference to the top of the scale. Compare an absolute masterpiece / absolutely brilliant. \n These amplifiers are somewhat different from emphasizers such as real(ly), which underscore the writer’s/speaker’s conviction about the word or phrase used, as in a really good speaker – rather than modifying the notional point of reference on a scale. Emphasizers add more to the interpersonal aspects of the text (see under that heading), and are available in various styles. The standard repertoire includes actually, certainly, definitely, surely, while their colloquial equivalents (awfully, incredibly, mega, terrifically etc.) are subject to fashion, and change from one generation to the next. Swear words such as bloody, damn(ed) and others are more durable,but suitable only for very informal styles of writing. In everyday speech, emphasizers serve to pinpoint significant words, and give the speaker a few more microseconds of time in which to develop an utterance. \n ♦ Compare hedge words."

		"title": "interjections",

Seen as “natural ejaculation[s] expressive of some feeling or emotion” (to use the Oxford Dictionary’s [1989] terms) – or as the tangential comments hurled by an unsympathetic listener at a speaker – they do not seem to contribute to the fabric of discourse. They were however recognized by the earliest Greek grammarians as a special class of words, purely emotive in meaning, which could stand as independent sentences. \n The traditional definition is echoed in many grammars and dictionaries, and their examples are confined to words such as Wow! Ouch! Great! Hell! But grammarians these days tend to analyze as interjections a variety of other words that function as mini-sentences to communicate an attitude or social orientation. These “reaction signals” and “formulae” include: \n ∗ reaction signals Yes, No, Right, Okay, Thanks \n ∗ expletives Damn, Jeez, Shit \n ∗ greetings and farewells Hello, Hi, Cheers, Goodbye All these, as well as backchannels such as Mm, Uh-huh, and pause-fillers such as Ah, Er, Well, are now accommodated in the category of interjections, by the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). The Longman Grammar (1999) does likewise, but under the label of inserts, to prevent confusion with the traditional interjection. \n English interjections can of course consist of more than one word, and these too are now recognized as members of the same grammatical class. Natural candidates are two-word greetings such as Good evening, as well as standardized reactions and formulae like Hear, hear! Good lord! Bottoms up! Break a leg! With little or no referential content, they are more like interjections than exclamations such as What a surprise! – though both are fragmentary sentences (see sentences section 2). \n Beyond the grammar of interjections, their role in interactive discourse is now beginning to be recognized. So whether it’s the collaborative Of course offered by one person to support another, or the skeptical Tell us another! designed to undermine the speaker, interjections are an important element of communication. Some now find a place in parliamentary records."

		"title": "international English",
		"explanation":"Against our heightened knowledge of variation in English around the world, the idea of a region-free, go-anywhere English has much appeal and is increasingly talked about. Its value is obvious for publishers and others who seek to market English language products. What could be better than a type of English that saves you from having to re-edit publications for individual regional markets! Teachers and learners of English as a second language also find it an attractive idea – both often concerned that their English should be neutral, without British or American or Canadian or Australian coloring. Any regional variety of English has a set of political, social and cultural connotations attached to it, even the so-called “standard” forms (see standard English and dialect). Regional associations can indeed be quite distracting, witness the effect (in translating a Buddhist dialogue) of making the guru say “Sure”! For non-Americans this puts an American accent on oriental wisdom. As that example shows, regional character can come through the printed word, even though it’s usually much more muted there than in live speech. As soon as we start to converse, we reveal what part of the world is home. \n So the idea of a fully fledged, regionally neutral form of English is somewhat idealistic. We can however get closer to it in the written medium, by identifying the variants of English usage that have the widest distribution. Thousands of words are in fact written in the same way everywhere in the world – like all those used so far in this paragraph. They make up the core of international English, though there are subtleties in terms of the set of meanings which are attached to a word in one region but not another – the subject of various entries in this book. Also challenging are words whose spelling or form diverges in British and American English, though an international variant can often be found where the sole variant for one variety is a familiar alternative in the other. Consider for example the spelling catalogue, which is standard in British English and a common alternative to catalog in American English. Spellings and usages such as these which are current on both sides of the Atlantic, are sometimes called “common English” (Benson et al., 1986). They are good candidates for international English, since the chances are that the same relativities between variants will hold for Englishes outside the US and UK (e.g. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa). The international English selections presented at the end of various entries in this book recommend themselves for this reason. \n International English is harder to maintain in informal style, since many colloquialisms have only local currency. But in standard styles of writing as used in newspaper articles printed in Canberra, New York, Singapore and London, regional identity may not be obvious, provided there are no references to local institutions. Writing that avoids the local and the colloquial may well qualify as “international.” See further under English or Englishes, and mid-Atlantic English. "

This is because they are defined in articulatory terms, i.e. by the speech organs used in producing them. The IPA symbols are indispensable whether we are attempting to describe sounds in a foreign language, or to pinpoint pronunciations of English words. A chart of the symbols used for English can be found in Appendix I. \n The symbols of the IPA are mostly drawn from the ordinary Roman alphabet, with permutated forms of them used to extend the inventory. A handful of others come from the Greek and Anglo-Saxon alphabets. Perhaps the most remarkable symbol of all is schwa represented by an upside-down, back-to-front e, which stands for the indeterminate vowel so often heard in English, and so variously written.

The global digital network it now refers to grew out of a more local system developed by the US military during the 1970s as part of a defense strategy, which was simply the internet. But in the following decade it began to connect with civilian and commercial organizations, and with ever-increasing numbers of participant institutions and global reach, it has become (the) Internet – the only one in the universe! In corpus data, a small number of writers dare to write it without a capital (around 5% in the BNC, less than 1% in CCAE). Though Internet dominates in British and American English at the turn of the millennium, it can only be a matter of time for it to be decapitalized, as noted in the Australian government Style Manual (2002). In phrases such as internet connection where it becomes a modifier, the lower case form is already more visible. There is no capital on the complementary term intranet (a digital communications network using the same technology but confined to a particular institution). Related terms such as website, web page do without a capital: see further under website. \n International English selection: Given that internet had no capital letter in the first place, and the generic nature of its use, the decapitalized form makes sense."

		"title": "interpersonal",
		"explanation":"Writers do not always think of themselves as setting up a relationship with their readers. They may not know who their readers are likely to be, and tend to forget about them when the subject itself becomes all-consuming. If the writing is technical or philosophical this may not matter, though the style may still seem rather “dry.” For writing which is intended as individual or private communication, it’s much more of an issue. A shortage of interpersonal elements then seems both dry and insensitive to the reader. It could undermine the very purpose of communicating. \n The interpersonal aspects of language or writing are all those elements which establish a particular relationship with the reader – as opposed to those which express information, or help to structure the text (the referential and textual aspects, respectively). The interpersonal effect is strong and direct in the first and second person pronouns (I, we, you), and in grammatical structures such as questions, commands and exclamations. Both contribute to a sentence such as: \n You really won’t believe how great the acting is! \n The interpersonal dimension in that sentence is also expressed through the use of the contraction won’t (likewise any word or structure which smacks of conversation); and the word great, which invites the reader to share a value judgement. Attitudinal adverbs and intensifiers/emphasizers such as really call for a reaction from the reader. Other words which have an interpersonal effect are those which mediate degrees of obligation, permission and possibility (modal auxiliaries such as must, should, can, as well as the adverbs which paraphrase them: necessarily, perhaps etc.). Words which express the writer’s judgement on the likelihood of something are again ones which call gently upon the reader. \n He’s likely to arrive on Friday. \n The word likely highlights the fact that the statement is an estimate, one which the reader may either accept or re-evaluate. (See further under modality.) \n Note that some words and expressions combine an interpersonal effect with their referential meaning. The word great has both when used in reference to someone’s acting, though the interpersonal effect is hardly there when it refers to the size of a crowd. \n ♦ See also textual."

		"explanation":"The weight of Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations suggest that interpretative has hitherto dominated the scene; and Fowler (1926) argued from Latin word-forming principles that it was the more legitimate, though he elsewhere argues against unnecessary syllables. American English now clearly prefers interpretive – which is not only shorter but more patently linked with the verb interpret. According to Webster’s English Usage (1989), this is a trend of the last few decades, and its strength is measured in CCAE data by the fact that interpretive outnumbers interpretative by about 10:1. In contemporary British English from the BNC, interpretative outnumbers interpretive by just on 2:1 – which could mean that interpretive is on the rise there too. The older British preference for interpretative still seems to be echoed in the Canadian Oxford (1998) and Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997), both of which give it priority over interpretive among the run-ons (see further under run in or run on).

Its potential is discussed in Webster’s Style Manual (1987), but it makes no showing in the Microsoft Manual of Style (1998).

		"title": "interrogative",
		"explanation":"This is the traditional grammarians’ name for the form of verbs that expresses a direct question: \n Are they coming to the barbecue? \n When will he decide? \n Do you like red wine? \n In English interrogative constructions, the normal subject-verb order is inverted, and the subject they/he/you follows the first (auxiliary) part of the verb. Compare the order in they are coming, he will decide etc. The third of these sentences shows how a simple verb like acquires an auxiliary (do) in the interrogative. In C16 it too could be made interrogative by inverting subject and verb: Like you red wine? But modern English always brings in do to form the interrogative when the verb is not itself an auxiliary. \n Modern grammars (e.g. Comprehensive Grammar, 1985) apply the term interrogative to the particular “sentence function” or “clause type” that expresses a question, rather than the distinctive verb form. (See further under mood and questions.) This recognizes the fact that an interrogative construction can express other speech functions, such as the imperative. In the US and elsewhere, the sentence Why don’t you open the door? is a polite way of instructing someone to do something."

Interrogative pronouns double as relativizers in relative clauses and complementizers in noun clauses. For example: \n The man who came to dinner went away amused. \n I asked them who else had been invited. \n Interrogative adverbs are used as subordinators in adverbial clauses: \n They went where no human being had ventured before. \n See clauses section 4."

But in practice the solid form into is quite often used where in to might be justified, and not too much is lost. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) confirms that into served both roles in earlier centuries; and even today it is not systematically contrasted with in to by all writers – though nice distinctions can be made, as between tucking someone into bed and tucking in to the pancakes. As that example shows, the need for in to might be argued particularly in relation to idiomatic verbs involving in. On the other hand, there is no requirement for into to refer to physical movement in space, and the object settles what kind of tucking is meant in each case. Metaphorical uses of into such as He’s turned into a monster and She’s into astrology confirm the general tendency to prefer the unspaced form. \n ♦ Compare onto or on to."

		"title": "inversion",
		"explanation":"Any departure from the normal word order used in a clause (subject–verb–object/complement) can be called inversion. Inverting subject and verb is a regular feature of certain English grammatical constructions, for example: \n ∗ in direct questions: Have you finished? \n Are they on their way? \n ∗ following an adverb which highlights the timing or location of an event at the start of a sentence: \n Here comes the bus. \n Now is the time to run for it. \n Down came the rain. \n There stood a surprised passenger. \n ∗ following a negative adverb or adverbial phrase: \n No sooner had he reached the bus than he found he’d lost his keys. \n Never had a man felt so embarrassed. \n Under no circumstances could he return home. \n As the last three examples show, inversion following a negative adverb/adverbial always requires an auxiliary verb immediately after. Exactly the same construction occurs after hardly and scarcely. Note that in all these constructions the subject is inverted after the auxiliary – whether it’s a pronoun or a noun phrase (Hardly had they / the bus arrived . . .). But after a simple verb, a pronoun subject cannot be inverted: “Here come they” is not acceptable, whereas Here comes the bus is fine. Other specialized uses of inversion include: \n ∗ stock phrases identifying the speaker in dialogue: \n “I’d like you to focus on my other side” says he. \n “Here we go again,” said the cameraman. \n ∗ clauses expressing an impossible condition may use inversion of the subject and verb instead of a conjunction: \n Had I known, I’d have been there (= If I had known . . . ) \n Were I an expert on computers, I’d have solved the problem. \n All the inversions so far, involving subject and verb, can appear in standard written or narrative prose. The inversion of object and verb is not often found in writing, but it’s common enough in conversation: \n Avocados they adore. Artichokes they hate. \n Inversions of this kind give special prominence to the object as the topic of the clause (see further under that heading). The use of object–verb inversion by poets seems to serve the same purpose: Brothers and sisters have I none . . . , although one suspects that it’s often motivated by the demands of rhyme and metre."

They include: \n erroneous extraneous instantaneous \n miscellaneous momentaneous spontaneous \n There are Latin models also for aqueous, igneous, ligneous, vitreous, and for the large number of biological names like farinaceous. (See further under -acious/-aceous.) \n Three special cases with -eous are advantageous, courageous, outrageous, all spelled that way because of the need to preserve a soft “g” in them. (See further under -ce/-ge.) \n Confusion between -ious and -uous. On occasions -ious is used by mistake for -uous, so that one hears and sees “presumptious” and “unctious,” instead of presumptuous and unctuous. This problem happens because of the related nouns in -ion (presumption, unction) from which -ious adjectives could be generated (compare cautious/caution above). \n All adjectives ending in -ious, -eous and -uous are members of the larger set ending in -ous (see further under that heading)."

		"title": "ipse dixit",
		"explanation":"This Latin phrase meaning “he himself said it” was originally used in Greek by the acolytes of Pythagoras to refer to the utterances of the master. In C18 English it became a way of referring to authoritarian statements about the language, alongside its more general meaning of “an assertion made on authority but not proved.” The ipse dixit rules of C18 grammarians met the cultural needs of the century (sometimes called “the age of correctness”), and were used to condemn the idiom of earlier authors, as well as ongoing changes in English usage. Some of the pronouncements, e.g. those concerning the uses of shall and will, have been transmitted through English language curriculums of C19 and C20 to become the linguistic fetishes of contemporary English.

The anglicized spellings Irak/Iraki are registered as alternatives in Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989), but citational evidence shows that this is mostly an older spelling, used in later C18 and earlier C19. Since 1921, when Mesopotamia became the kingdom and then the republic of Iraq, the spellings Iraq/Iraqi have become the standard, and Iraki is captured in one solitary citation since then. The Arabic form of the word has prevailed in English, despite its rather un-English use of q without a following u, probably because it’s a proper name. \n ♦ For common nouns in which q and k vary, see q/k."

		"title": "Ireland and Irish",
		"explanation":"Only in geography – and jokes – can Ireland/Irish refer to the whole of “the Emerald Isle.” The 1921 split into Northern Ireland (the northeastern segment sometimes called “Ulster”) and a larger southern dominion, first called the Irish Free State, then Eire from 1937 to 1949, and now Republic of Ireland, makes for complications in the use of both noun and adjective. References to the government, its people and their language(s), must qualify the name in some way for precise communication. \n The official names Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland (less formally Irish Republic) are neutral and usable anywhere. The use of Ulster for Northern Ireland is informal and not-so-neutral, suggesting a commitment to the connection with Great Britain, as in Ulster Defence Association. The fact that three of the nine provinces once part of Ulster now belong to the Republic also complicates the use of that name. Neither Ulster nor Eire (for the Irish Republic) are necessarily familiar elsewhere (not in Canada, according to Canadian English Usage, (1997). \n Names for the people of Ireland also present a challenge. Irish Republican and Northern Irishman mark the difference, though they are not established terms. Ulsterman (for the latter) is not entirely accurate or politically neutral, as explained. Both Irishman and Ulsterman would sound sexist elsewhere in the world, if not at home (see further under nonsexist language). That leaves Irish Republican and Northern Irish. \n The original Celtic language of Ireland is known to scholars as Irish; but in ordinary usage it’s Gaelic, a reminder of its close similarity to the Celtic language of Scotland. The English of Ireland diverges into three varieties, according to McArthur (1992): \n ∗ Anglo-Irish, developed out of the variety brought by English settlers in C17, and used across most of Ireland by middle- and “working”-class Irish \n ∗ Hiberno-English, a chiefly working-class variety originating with those whose forebears spoke Irish Gaelic, used by the Catholic population of Ireland (including Northern Ireland) \n ∗ Ulster Scots, the English associated particularly with Protestants in Northern Ireland, based on the Lowland Scots brought by Scottish settlers in Ulster. \n The term Irish English is often used to cover all three varieties, though it rides roughshod over significant regional and cultural differences.

In the BNC ironic outnumbers ironical by more than 8:1, and in CCAE by a factor of more than 20:1 – so the British preference for ironic is a much stronger commitment for American writers. But whatever the frequency, the two appear to be interchangeable in meaning and grammar.

		"title": "irony",
		"explanation":"This much-used concept originated on the Greek stage, in the duality of meaning created by the character whose words had a simple, immediate meaning as well as another, discrepant meaning for the audience who saw them in the context of the whole play and of the common culture. \n From there the notion of irony has been extended to the similar effect achieved in modern forms of literature – when there’s a discrepancy between the immediate meaning of a writer’s words, and the shades of meaning they take on in a broader context. The effect may be gentle as in Jane Austen’s works, or biting, as in those of Jonathan Swift. Either way the effect is cerebral, and depends on the comprehensiveness of the reader’s response. In this respect irony differs from sarcasm, which uses taunting words to launch a direct and explicit attack on another person. \n Irony is also to be seen in real-life situations and events which turn out contrary to what one might expect. It might for example seem ironic to appoint an emotionally unstable person to counsel others with emotional problems. \n ♦ For the choice between ironic and ironical, see previous entry."

		"title": "irregardless",
		"explanation":"This is a contentious blend of irrespective and regardless, with the same meaning as either. Irregardless has negative affixes at both ends, and thus has a built-in double negative. The effect is redundant rather than rhetorical, as with other double negatives, but it helps to explain objections to it (see further under double negatives). \n The redundant negative in irregardless goes with its use in informal discourse, and the few examples of its natural use in American and British databases (CCAE and BNC) are from transcribed speech or casual journalism. These are greatly outnumbered by examples in which it’s the focus of formal linguistic admonition, suggesting that it has become fetishized (see fetish). Irregardless came into the spotlight in the US amid the emotive public debate that accompanied the publication of Webster’s Third New International Dictionary in 1961. The dictionary marked the word as “nonstandard,” but its presence in the headword list was mistakenly or perversely used by critics to imply that the dictionary endorsed its use, and was out of touch with language standards. The debate gave the word much more attention than it deserves. \n ♦ Compare ain’t."

		"title": "irregular verbs",
		"explanation":"An important minority of English verbs are irregular in the way in which they form their past tense and past participle. Regular verbs simply add -ed for both the past forms, whether they go back to Anglo-Saxon, or are later acquisitions from French and Latin: want(ed), depart(ed), precipitat(ed). The irregular verbs are remnants of several groups that existed in Anglo-Saxon, as well as once regular verbs which have developed their own idiosyncrasies over the centuries. \n The common irregular verbs are grouped below according to the number of changes that their stems undergo to form the past tense and past participle. The great majority are conjugated in exactly the same way for British and American English. But where the paradigms diverge slightly, as when a verb is irregular for Brits but not necessarily for Americans (e.g. burn), or vice versa (e.g. dive), it appears in the irregular class that covers its changes. Note that the classification is based on spelling, not the sound of the word; and so the doubling of a consonant, the loss of a final e or the alteration of a vowel from two letters to one would qualify as a change. All those in bold are discussed further in individual entries in this book. \n Irregular verbs by class \n 1 Those which use the same form for past and present: \n burst cast cut hit hurt let \n put quit read rid set shed \n shut slit split spread thrust \n The verbs bid meaning “declare (a wager),” and cost (“assess the value of ”) can also be included here, as well as spit (for American usage: cf. section 3 below). Beat belongs here in terms of its past tense, and informal zero past participle: with the standard past participle beaten, it has more in common with section 7 verbs. See also section 7a for bid (“utter [a greeting]”). Other verbs of this type appear under section 9. \n 2a) Those which keep the stem vowel as written and replace d with t: \n bend build lend rend send spend \n  Two special cases are have and make, where d replaces other stem consonants. \n 2b) Those which simply add t, such as deal and mean. This also applies, for some British, Canadian and Australian writers, to a number of other verbs including: \n burn dream lean leap learn spoil \n Others in Britain and Australia, and North Americans at large would keep such verbs regular. See further under -ed. \n 3 Those which have a single vowel change for both past forms: \n bleed breed feed meet speed (ee>e) \n bind fight find grind wind (i>ou) \n cling dig fling sling slink spin stick sting string (i>u) \n Special cases are win (i>o), shoot (oo>o), sit (i>a), hold (o>e), hang (a>u), all one-off examples of the same kind. In American English spit>spat is a further example. Note also come and run, which form past tenses by changing the vowel to a, but revert for the past participle. \n 4a) Those which change the stem vowel and follow it with t: \n creep feel keep kneel sleep sweep weep (ee>e) \n 4b) Those which reduce a double consonant to single and add t: \n dwell smell spell spill \n For dwell, this is the dominant pattern worldwide, whereas the other three are kept regular by Americans, Canadians and some Australians. (See under -ed.) \n 4c) Those which change the stem vowel and follow it with d: \n  sell tell (e>o) \n A similar one-off example is do which becomes did. \n 5 Those which change the stem vowel and one or more of the consonants, as well as adding t: \n bring>brought buy>bought \n catch>caught leave>left \n seek>sought teach>taught \n think>thought \n Special cases of verbs which change vowels and consonants (but do not add t) are stand>stood and strike>struck. The verb sneak with its alternative or colloquial past tense snuck, used in North America and elsewhere, belongs to the same set. \n 6 Those with two different stem vowels for the past tense and the past participle: \n begin drink ring shrink sing \n sink spring stink swim (i>a>u) \n Most of these can be found with u for the past tense in some linguistic and stylistic contexts: see individual entries. See further under section 9. \n 7a) Those with a different stem vowel for the past tense, and the present tense vowel for the past participle, with (e)n added on: \n awake forsake shake take wake (a> oo/o >a) \n blow grow know throw (o>e>o) \n Others of the same kind are give, forgive (give>gave>given). One-off examples are bid (“utter [a greeting]” with bade/bidden, eat (ate>eaten), fall (fell>fallen), draw (drew>drawn), and see (saw>seen). \n 7b) Those which use a different stem vowel for both forms of the past (past tense and past participle), and add (e)n to the latter: \n break freeze speak steal weave (ea>o) \n bear swear tear wear (ea>o) \n Note that for bear the past participle is borne. Others which belong here are get and forget (get>got>gotten), though the use of gotten with get is not found in all varieties of English. The verbs bite and hide are further members of the set. \n 7c) Those with two different stem vowels for the past tense and the past participle, plus -en added on: \n drive ride rise strive write (i>o>i) \n  Stride has different forms for past tense / past participle in British English, but works with just one (strode) in American English. Strive is conjugated as a weak verb by some in both the US and the UK (see section 9). The American conjugation of dive with dove as past tense would fit here, although it has no past participle with -en. Other special cases are fly ( flew>flown) and lie (lay>lain). \n 8 Those which borrow forms from other verbs to make their past tense (sometimes called suppletive verbs). The outstanding cases of this are go (went) and be (was/were>been). The verb be has more distinct parts than any other English verb. See further at be. \n 9 Unstable irregular verbs and hybrids. Changes are still going on for some verbs with irregular parts. Some with two different forms for the past tense and past participle work increasingly with just one. This is happening with shrink >shrank>shrunk (now often shrink>shrunk) and almost all section 6 verbs, aligning them with fling, slink and other section 3 verbs. These reduced patterns are already quite common in speech, and will no doubt become unremarkable in writing, sooner or later. \n Other verbs showing ongoing change are reverting to the regular pattern with -ed for the past tense/participle. This is true for verbs such as bet, knit, shit, sweat, wed, wet. It can be seen with: \n light (lit) now often lighted \n shear (shore>shorn) sheared \n shine (shone) shined \n shoe (shod) shoed \n speed (sped) speeded \n strive (strove>striven) strived \n weave (wove>woven) weaved \n In some cases, e.g. shine, weave, the regular past form has a slightly different meaning from the irregular one (see under the individual headings). In others (e.g. strive) the shift is more advanced in the US than the UK. This also holds for verbs such as hew, mow, which have long since acquired a regular past tense, but their -n past participle stands firm, at least in the UK. \n The number of verbs reverting to the regular pattern is much larger than that going the other way. This opposite process can however be seen with hang and sneak (for both past forms), and saw and show (for the past participle only). See individual entries."

		"title": "irrelevance or irrelevancy",
		"explanation":"Irrelevancy had a 40 years headstart on irrelevance in C19, but the latter has more than made up the ground in the following century. Dictionaries everywhere give it priority, and irrelevance outnumbers irrelevancy by more than 10:1 in BNC data, though in CCAE it’s more like 2:1. Neither database suggests any division of labor that would make irrelevance the more abstract of the two (see further under -nce/-ncy). Only irrelevancy can be made plural (irrelevancies), yet both words can be made countable in the singular (an irrelevancy, an irrelevance). British writers rarely seem to qualify irrelevancy, whereas they give pen to various kinds of irrelevance including (an) expensive / humorous/quaint/virtual irrelevance. In American English, either word can be qualified in this way, but the more rhetorical adjectives go with irrelevance, witness comments on the stunning/stupefying/cosmic/terminal irrelevance.

		"title": "-ish",
		"explanation":"This Old English suffix has been used for a thousand years and more to create ethnic adjectives out of proper names. Modern examples are: \n British Danish English Finnish Flemish \n Irish Jewish Polish Swedish Turkish \n A similar and equally old use of the suffix is to create adjectives which connote the qualities of the noun they’re based on: \n bookish boyish childish churlish feverish \n fiendish foolish freakish girlish owlish \n popish priggish prudish selfish sheepish \n stylish waspish \n The examples show that these words are usually built on stems of one-syllable – though standoffish proves otherwise. Many such words have negative implications, and writers who are concerned about them in, say, childish will resort to the neutral childlike instead (see further under -like). \n In informal language -ish is highly productive, adding a tentative quality to the words formed with it. Adjectives like greenish, whitish, brownish are not quite the color named in them; and lowish, tallish, thickish hint at a particular quality without asserting it. In indicating age or time, we may use -ish words to avoid sounding too strict about the matter: \n His wife was thirtyish. \n Let’s have dinner about eightish. \n The use of -ish after “about” is of course redundant, but its informality and tentativeness are important in some situations."

Islamic serves as the all-purpose adjective for referring to the political, legal and cultural institutions of Islam, as well as the Muslim world generally. It thus comes close to being synonymous with “Arabic.” \n ♦ See also Muhammad and Muslim."

		"title": "island or isle",
		"explanation":"The first and longer spelling is more frequent by far, in both geographical names and common usage. Very few of the countless islands named in the index of any atlas are Isles, except those belonging to the British Isles, witness the Isles of Man/Wight/Anglesey, not to mention Mull/Islay/Skye/Iona. Fair Isle knitted products are a reminder of another in the Shetlands. There is also a sprinkling of placenames with Isle in North America, partly thanks to French occupation, as indicated in names such as Belle Isle, Presque Isle, Isle au Haut, Isle Royale. Isle is also caught up in a few unmistakably English placenames – Deer Isle, Pine Purple Isle, Isle of Palms,– reflecting later Anglo-Saxon occupation. Island is otherwise the standard geographical term, and the one used in translating names from other languages. \n Yet isle still serves here and there as a simple paraphrase for island especially in American English. Ellis Island, the historic gateway for immigration to the US, was also the Isle of Hope / Isle of Tears. Some American writers use isle as a hyponym of island, speaking of the Isle of Guernsey among the Channel Islands, and Garden Isle in the Hawaiian group, though these are unofficial names. Travel writers sometimes use isle in reference to that paradisal place for the ultimate vacation in Greece or the Caribbean. The word still lends something to the imagination that island cannot. The phrases desert isle and tropical isle are still found very occasionally among American writers in CCAE, where their British counterparts in the BNC always use desert/tropical island. \n The fondness for isle goes back to the beginnings of modern English literature with Shakespeare’s “this sceptered isle” and frequent use of the word in C17 and C18 poetry. Its single syllable lent itself to the demands of poetic meter, as it still does to newspaper headlines – TRAGEDY ON A CARIBBEAN ISLE – though its chances of appearing in the news report below are pretty small. In earlier centuries part of the appeal of isle was its Frenchness, although its spelling (a C15 respelling of ile) represents more antiquarian interests. The silent s in isle (and in island) is the contribution of Renaissance scholars who wanted the word to reflect its origins in the Latin insula. They were right about isle – but not island, which is a strictly tautologous Germanic compound ieg land (“island + land”). (See further under spelling section 1.)"

		"title": "-ism",
		"explanation":"This suffix has come to us through early Christianity in Greek words such as baptism.

Words based on -ism are not uncommon in medicine, to describe particular conditions such as astigmatism, monogolism, rheumatism. \n A further role of -ism is to refer to the features of a given speech style, especially a distinctive word or idiom: \n archaism colloquialism genteelism \n malapropism neologism provincialism \n solecism truism vulgarism \n witticism \n Similar terms are formed with proper names to identify a regional or language-specific expression: \n Americanism Gallicism Hellenism Scotticism \n They can even get personal, in ad hoc creations such as a Clive Jamesism. \n Apart from attaching itself to almost anything, -ism sometimes assumes a life of its own, as a count noun: \n Postwar affluence has fostered hundreds of isms among younger people. \n When it stands on its own as an abbreviated word, ism is negatively charged."

		"title": "Israel",
		"explanation":"This name links both ancient and modern Jewish tradition. Since 1948 it has been the name of the Jewish state in the eastern Mediterranean, established after the horrors of World War II. The land was of course occupied by Jews in biblical times, though the area was then known as Palestine, and while Israel was the northern section, Judah was the southern. The word Israelite also goes back to biblical times, whereas Israelitish is a medieval word. Neither is in common use nowadays except in historical references, and instead the word Israeli serves to identify both the citizen of Israel and its culture. \n The creation of the modern state of Israel was the culmination of half a century’s work by Zionists. The Zionist movement was both mystical and practical; and with its emphasis on Jewish ethnicity and Hebrew culture, it united Jews scattered across Europe. Within contemporary Israel, Zionists continue to develop the common language and culture, though their emphasis on Jewish nationalism is felt by some to displace the essential Jewish religion. \n The words Jew and Jewish seem to have outlived the pejorative associations which hung around them through centuries when anti-Semitic attitudes prevailed. Jewish now serves to mark the religious identity of Israelis and others round the world, and thus corresponds to Christian, Buddhist etc. \n The word Hebrew is used to name the official language of modern Israel. Again it’s a link between past and present, being the name of the ancient Semitic language of the scriptures, as well as its updated and expanded counterpart. Yiddish is used more informally among Jewish emigrants from eastern Europe. It is a dialect of German, with elements from Slavonic languages and Hebrew added in."

Many of the words are Latin and French loanwords, but others are simple English formations: \n archeologist artist botanist \n cartoonist chemist columnist \n dentist diarist economist \n flautist harpist humorist \n organist pianist soloist \n violinist \n Apart from its use to designate fields of expertise, -ist also serves to create words which refer to particular attitudes or habits of mind: \n anarchist conservationist defeatist \n escapist humanist materialist \n nationalist perfectionist theorist \n Proper nouns as well as common names can provide the base, witness Marxist and Peronist as further examples. \n As with -ism, -ist attaches itself to both nouns and adjectives, and this sometimes results in double coinings. For example: \n agriculturist agriculturalist constitutionist \n constitutionalist conversationist conversationalist \n educationist educationalist horticulturist \n horticulturalist \n The longer (adjective-based) forms are preferred in all varieties of English for constitutionalist and conversationalist, but there are divergences over the other pairs.

(See further under coherence or cohesion.) \n But elsewhere it is simply a slot-filler in the syntax of the clause. In statements like It was raining or It’s almost midnight, it serves as the grammatical subject without referring to anything in particular. Modern grammarians emphasize its emptiness, calling it a “dummy” subject (Longman Grammar, 1999) or “prop it ” (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985). \n Other structural uses of it are as the anticipatory device for extraposed constructions, for example: \n It was important to reach agreement. \n It was agreed that the meeting should be adjourned. \n Set phrases like it was important/impossible to and it was agreed/found that are among the commonest four-part “lexical bundles” in academic prose, according to the Longman Grammar. They are the stuff of the impersonal and often passive style found in reports and formal documents – not their most appealing feature. They make for repetitive and rather weak sentence openings, effectively delaying the topical item, rather than contributing to meaningful topical progression (see further under topic). \n But it is also a strategic device for altering the focus of discourse, in cleft sentences like the following: \n It was only last Christmas that we decided to go. \n There it picks out as its complement one particular constituent from the following clause, making it the topic of interest and subordinating the rest. (See further under cleft sentences.) Cleft it cannot however be used very often, or it becomes a mannerism. In any case it needs watching when it turns up at the start of adjacent sentences.

Even in specialized fields such as art and architecture, Italian technical terms such as fresco, loggia, pergola and portico are given English plurals.

Wordprocessors now offer them as a supplement to the main font, though their availability on the printer may be the key to whether they can be part of your repertoire. Italic characters are not part of the basic ASCII font used for internet transmission, and quote marks may be needed to highlight the occasional word. In handwriting, and on typewriters and wordprocessors where italics are not available, underlining serves the purpose. \n As the alternative typeface, italic helps to make a word or string of words stand out from the carrier sentence. But on the computer screen it’s less distinct than on the printed page because of lower resolution (Whitbread, 2001). Webdesigners and the authors of electronic documents therefore minimize the use of italics, and use boldface or color contrast instead. Underlining is not recommended because of its use in hyperlinking. \n Like any contrastive device, italics work best when used sparingly, and are not very effective for whole sentences. Their use also raises certain questions and anomalies, which are dealt with in the final section of this entry. Note that italic (noun, singular) is the standard term for the font in the UK (Copy-editing, 1992; Oxford Guide to Style, 2002). But elsewhere – in the US, Canada and Australia – the plural italics is used. \n Common uses of italics \n 1 With English words: \n (a) to emphasize a particular word in its context: That’s not a rhetorical question! \n (b) to draw attention to an unusual word or one being used in an unusual way, such as an archaism, malapropism or neologism. \n (c) to highlight technical terms or words which are themselves the focus of discussion. Technical terms are usually italicized for first appearance only, whereas those under discussion would be italicized regularly. \n 2 With foreign words. Italics are often used to highlight borrowed words and phrases which are not yet fully assimilated into English. However judging the extent of their assimilation is a vexed question, and one on which it’s difficult to be consistent. Dictionaries themselves wrestle with the problem, and their conclusions are sometimes inscrutable. Why should a fortiori and carte blanche have italics but not a posteriori and carte-de-visite (in the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors, 1981)? Instead of providing a canon of words to be italicized, other authorities leave it to individual writers and editors to decide, depending on the readership. The Chicago Manual (2003) advises against italicizing any familiar foreign words when they are used in an English context. But if the loanword needs its full quota of accents or diacritics, e.g. piece de r ` esistance, vis- ´ a-vis ` , it probably needs italics too (Bliss, 1966). Once the accents disappear, as in debris and debut (formerly debris ´ and debut ´ ), they might as well be printed in roman. Any reduction in the number of accents, as from two to one in resume,´ is also grounds for not using italics. \n 3 With Latin abbreviations. These are no longer set in italics, though special exceptions are made by some editors (see under Latin abbreviations). \n 4 With individual letters. Italics are one way of setting off single letters against accompanying words, e.g. “minding yourps and qs.” (For other ways, see under letters as words.) \n 5 With the titles of compositions. By general agreement you italicize the titles of books, periodicals and newspapers, of plays, films, works of art (including sculpture), and opera and music: \n Angela’s Ashes \n Radio Days \n Six Degrees of Separation \n The Creation \n The Phantom of the Opera \n The Statue of Liberty \n The Independent Time \n An important exception is the bible and its various books, and other sacred texts such as the Koran, which are always in roman. \n In the mass media, italics are now used generally for the titles of both TV and radio programs. But when it comes down to the names of individual segments or episodes, many style manuals recommend using roman font plus quote marks (Chicago Manual; Oxford Guide to Style, 2002; Australian government Style Manual, 2002). This practice is analogous to the distinction made traditionally between the title of a book and the names of individual essays or poems within it. Yet the Chicago Manual also advises that italics can be used for both the larger work and the items within, when the two are juxtaposed repeatedly in critical writing. In any case, the distinction is not always easy to make. \n 6 With official names: \n a) the official titles of legislative acts and statutes are set in roman (e.g. the Copyright Act, the Constitution) in the UK, Canada and the US. But Americans do use italics when referring to them in their published form, according to the Chicago Manual. Australian style, by contrast, uses italics for both full and abbreviated references to acts and statutes, according to the government Style Manual – except that the titles of Bills before parliament are styled in roman. \n b) the official names of court cases are italicized, as in Kramer v. Kramer. British style is to put the v. separating the names in roman (see Copy-editing); whereas Australian government style prefers italics. North American style allows either italics or roman (Chicago Manual; Editing Canadian English, 2000), provided it’s consistent within the text. \n c) the names of trains, ships, submarines, spacecraft and other special vehicles are italicized: \n Flying Scotsman \n HMS Frolic \n CSS Shenandoah \n Challenger \n Note that the prefixes are not italicized. \n d) the Latin names of plants and animals, both genus and species (as well as subspecies and variety), are italicized, as in: \n Nyssa silvatica Falco peregrinus \n But when the generic name is used as the common name, as for example with “camellia” and many other plants, it’s printed in roman. \n 7 With performing directions. In the texts of plays or movie scripts, stage directions are printed in italics to separate them from the dialogue. In musical scores, italics are likewise used for references to the dynamics of performing, to separate them from the words of the score. \n Questions and conundrums with italics. Italicized words raise the question as to what to do when they need to be made plural or possessive. Should the apostrophe s or plural (e)s ending be in italics or roman? The traditional answer for the possessive ending has been roman, and this is still preferred by the major style guides. When it comes to plural endings, the s goes into italics when attached to a foreign word, e.g. several touches, ´ but stays in roman if it’s a title, e.g. two National Geographics. \n Any punctuation mark immediately following an italicized word is usually in italics too, for the congruity of line. This is of course less important for a full stop than for a semicolon or question/exclamation mark. Note however that accompanying brackets, whether square or rounded, are still in roman. \n Finally, how can items normally italicized be identified within italicized titles or headings? Italic within italics is somehow needed. Lacking that, editors and writers resort to quotation marks, go back to roman, or stay with italics for it (thus leaving it undistinguished). Quotation marks are usually given to titles within titles, and roman to Latin biological names. But Copy-editing notes the rather self-conscious effect of giving quotation marks to foreign words in titles or headings, commenting that it’s best to leave them in italics just like the rest."

		"title": "-ite",
		"explanation":"Though ultimately from Greek, -ite is a lively suffix – whether you think of socialite or dynamite. It serves in both common and scientific usage to make nouns which refer to someone with a particular affiliation, and to form the names of certain minerals and chemical substances. \n In common usage -ite normally attaches itself to proper names. Cases such as socialite and suburbanite are the exception. Much more often it picks up a place name, as in Brooklynite, Canaanite, Muscovite; or that of a notable person, as in Ibsenite, Thatcherite, Trotskyite; or that of a party or movement, as in Labourite and pre-Raphaelite. The suffix sometimes seems derogatory, though not all the examples given would show this. At any rate, the -ite word tends to be used by those opposed to the person or party named, while supporters and adherents are unlikely to apply it to themselves. Darwinite is probably less neutral than Darwinist or Darwinian. (See further under -an and -ist.) \n In scientific usage, -ite has several functions. In geology it serves as a regular suffix for naming minerals, such as anthracite, dolomite, malachite; and for the names of various fossils: ammonite, lignite, trilobite. In chemistry it’s used for naming explosives such as dynamite and melinite, as well as the salts of certain acids (those whose names end in -ous), for example nitrite and sulfite. The fictional name kryptonite (the only substance that can reduce Superman to a trembling heap) seems to carry the aura of several of these scientific uses."

	{
		"title": "its or it's",
		"explanation":"Separated only by an apostrophe, there are few pairs in English which cause as much trouble as these. The usual problem is that it’s is put where its is needed – people insert the apostrophe just in case. \n Its without the apostrophe is a possessive pronoun/determiner, pure and simple, as in left the dog on its own. Like the other pronouns in those roles (his, hers etc.), its has no apostrophe. What confuses the issue is the fact that nouns do have apostrophes when they are possessive, as in the dog’s breakfast or a baker’s dozen, suggesting that it’s is the possessive pronoun for it. The mistake is common in unedited writing, on paper or the internet, but can also be seen in small press outputs, circular advertising and occasionally in major newspapers (Wales, 1996). In fact it’s was used interchangeably with its for the possessive pronoun until around 1800, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). \n It’s with the apostrophe is a contraction of it is, or occasionally of it has. The apostrophe is a mark of omission, not possession (see further under apostrophes). Note that because it consists of a pronoun plus a verb, the contraction is often used to introduce statements: \n It’s true. It’s unexpected. \n (Compare its truth, its unexpectedness when the possessive pronoun/determiner is needed to preface a noun.) It’s replaced ’tis as the regular contraction for it is during later C18 – having previously been regarded as “vulgar,” i.e. the nonliterary contraction. When contracted it’s began to appear in writing, the possessive pronoun had to be distinguished from it, hence the insistence on writing it without an apostrophe. \n From its debut in early C19, contracted it’s has become increasingly common in everyday writing (see contractions section 2). It compacts the space occupied by the functional words of the sentence, and like French c’est (“it is”) enhances the flow of expository prose. It’s therefore appears from time to time in the text of this book."

		"title": "-ity",
		"explanation":"This is the ending of many an abstract noun which embodies the quality of a related adjective. As ethnic is contained in ethnicity, so circular is in circularity, and readable in readability. Many other nouns ending in -ity are not really English formations but words borrowed direct from French (e.g. falsity) or modeled on Latin (e.g. sincerity); and in some cases (e.g atrocity, hilarity) the abstract noun was current in English quite a while before the related adjective. But their large numbers have helped to foster English formations of the same kind. \n The most productive types in modern English are those like readability, based on adjectives ending in -able (accountability, respectability) or -ible (compatibility, feasibility). (See further under -ability.) Such words are surprisingly popular, in spite of all their syllables: the earlier unaccountableness has given place to unaccountability, unavailableness to unavailability and so on. The inventory of -ity nouns is 33% longer than that of those ending -ness, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). Nouns ending in -ity outnumber those ending in -ness by more than 4:1 in newspapers and 9:1 in academic writing. See further under -ness."

But both spellings are used in the UK, and BNC data shows organisation occurring in almost twice as many texts as organization.

The choice between -ization and -isation depends on the same issues as those discussed in the next entry (-ize/-ise)."

	{
		"title": "-ize/-ise",
		"explanation":"In American English, spellings with -ize are standard for the many verbs with that ending, whether they’re as old as baptize or as recent as energize. The same holds in Canada. But in British English, it’s possible to use either -ise or -ize, and the arguments are almost equally balanced. New Oxford (1999) gives priority to -ize spellings, in keeping with the Oxford tradition, while BNC data shows that the -ise spellings are actually more popular with contemporary British writers – witness the following frequencies: \n realise 3898 realize 2234 \n recognise 3641 recognize 2104 \n organise 1273 organize 824 \n emphasise 964 emphasize 661 \n In these cases and others like them, the -ise spellings outnumber those with -ize in the ratio of about 3:2. In Australian English, the difference is still greater (often 3:1, by frequencies in the ACE corpus), and the tendency has been reinforced by official endorsement of -ise by the Australian government Style Manual since 1966. The Australian Oxford (1999) prioritizes the -ise spellings. Choosing between the two was clearly vexing for Fowler (1926), and many of the issues are still with us. The preference for -ize may be underpinned by linguistic factors, such as: \n ∗ ( phonological ) -ize seems to represent better the “z” sound of the suffix. This point is somewhat undermined by the fact that in rise or applies, the letter s also represents “z.” But at least z represents just one sound rather than two. Arguably it helps to take some of the load off the letter s. \n ∗ (etymological ) -ize correlates better with antecedents of the suffix in Greek (-izein), and in late Latin (-izare). Scholars have in the past tried to give -ize to words which go back to Greek or Latin, and thus distinguish classical loanwords from similar ones borrowed from French with -ise. Yet often it proved impossible to know whether the source was French or classical. This impasse prompted the present-day resolution of the problem – to use either -ize or -ise for all. Either way, it downplays what’s known about the etymology, and the trained etymologist will find -ise anachronistic in classical examples, and -ize unsatisfactory in French loanwords. These loans are in fact a minority in comparison with modern English formations with -ize/-ise – which outnumber all other verb coinings, in both academic prose and conversation (Longman Grammar, 1999). For new derivatives, the spelling of the suffix is arbitrary. \n There are reasons both practical and etymological for choosing -ise, as Fowler found. If we apply the -ise spelling to all susceptible words of two or more syllables, we are left with a single exception: capsize (see under that heading). But if you choose -ize, the list of exceptions which need the alternative spelling is as least as long as the following: \n advertise advise apprise chastise \n circumcise comprise compromise despise \n devise excise exercise franchise \n improvise incise revise supervise \n surmise surprise televise \n Apart from these, which are all verbs, the problem arises with other words such as enterprise and merchandise, which are acquiring verbal roles (as in enterprising, merchandising). Etymology dictates that -ise should be used in such words, and the policy of using -ise everywhere makes them part of the general pattern. With an -ize policy they are yet more special cases. The argument of fewer exceptions would explain why British English has inclined to -ise during C20. Fowler observed it in a majority of English printers in the 1920s; and BNC data shows it in the 1990s \n But the “fewer exceptions” argument loses some of its force in the US, where dictionaries already allow some of the words in Fowler’s list to be spelled with -ize (e.g. advertize, apprize, comprize), and where -yze is used instead of -yse in analyse etc. (see further under -yze/-yse). If and when all such words can everywhere be spelled with z, the chief argument for choosing -ise would evaporate. Even now the regional distribution of -ize spellings makes it the better option for all but Fowler’s exceptions. It is more broadly based than -ise, as the standard spelling in North America and the alternative spelling of a still largish community of writers/publishers in Britain, and some in Australia. Scientists the world over tend to use -ize, according to the CBE Manual (1994). \n International English selection: The systematic use of -ize spellings recommends itself on distributional and phonological grounds, despite some exceptions, as discussed."

		"title": "Jacobean, Jacobite, Jacobin and Jacobian",
		"explanation":"The first three words relate to different historical periods, and to a different James or Jacques (since the Latin Jacobus underlies both the English and French names). The fourth embodies the name of Jacobi, the C19 German mathematician. \n Jacobean relates to the history and culture of James I’s reign in England (1603–25), particularly its literary and architectural heritage. The spelling cannot be varied with -ian (unlike other words ending in -ean: see under -an) because of the mathematicians’ claim on Jacobian – not that anyone is likely to confuse Jacobean tragedy with the Jacobian (determinant) in equations. \n Jacobite connects with James II, who abdicated / was overthrown in 1688, and whose descendants and supporters led unsuccessful Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1745. The suffix seems to carry the negative or alien associations of some other similar formations with proper names (see further under -ite). The suggestion (noted in Gowers, 1965) that Jacobite could also be used for “devotees of the [American] writer Henry James” would be most likely to come from the pens of James’s detractors. \n Jacobin is French in origin, connecting with the radical Jacobin revolutionaries who originally met in the Dominican convent near the church of St-Jacques in Paris.

The County Gaol was a conspicuous Victorian institution, and HM Gaol still makes the backdrop for the occasional television show filmed on location. But C20 British writers use jail, which outnumbers gaol by about 5:1 in BNC data. The Oxford Dictionary has always given priority to jail, borrowed from Central French and used in English since C17.

Those able to use jargon with confidence enjoy a sense of solidarity with others who do the same. Jargon is thus inclusive in its effect for some – and very exclusive for others. Its power to exclude is what gives jargon its negative connotations. The word is quite often used to express the resentment felt by those who cannot “talk the lingo” and feel disadvantaged by it: \n I couldn’t get a word in. They talked economic jargon all through dinner. \n Those who use jargon can be unaware of how specialized it is or how dependent they are on it. The jargon habit becomes ingrained in writing if you write only for a restricted audience or within a particular institution. In bureaucracies, acronyms can become part of the jargon. \n Jargon has something in common with occupational slang, though it differs in being standardized.

		"title": "jaw's harp, jaws harp or jew's harp",
		"explanation":"These are all names for a small folk instrument which originated in southern Asia (in India, Borneo and New Guinea) as well as Europe. It has little in common with a harp, and consists of a single strip of vibrating metal, set in a frame which is held between the teeth, and plucked with a fingertip. The mouth itself acts as resonator, and as modifier of the pitch. Thus the plain names jaw’s harp or jaws harp highlight the method of playing, as for other instruments, e.g. viola da gamba (“viol for the leg”). Grove’s Dictionary of Music (1879–89) speculated that jaw’s harp was the original name, and that jew’s harp was a corruption of it. Yet things seem to be the other way round. The instrument was in fact known as a jew’s harp or jew’s tromp from C16 on, centuries before the first reference to the jaw’s harp in Grove’s Dictionary. The Jewish element is built into the English name for the instrument as well as one of the German ones (Judenharfe). Yet the instrument has no special connection with the Jews; nor is it necessarily a poor man’s means of making music. Some of the jew’s harps exhibited in museums are exquisitely worked in silver.

Canadians use both spellings with about equal frequency, according to Canadian English Usage (1997), whereas Australians clearly prefer jewellery. \n No surprises then that the retailer of jewels is usually spelled jeweller in UK, while jeweler is standard in US.

That apart, it still carries the kinds of social prejudice that Jew and Jewish used to carry (see further under Israel). Webster’s English Usage (1989) queries whether it may be less offensive in American than British English. But Webster’s examples are almost entirely from Jewish writers, which would only show that it is one of those terms that can be used innocuously by insiders but not the outsider.

Generic words such as attorney, chemist, clerk, educator, engineer, lawyer, jurist, optician are applied in different ways in North America, the UK, Australia and New Zealand (see for example educator, lawyer, optician). None of them translates very well from one region to another. \n Within any country, occupational classifications are often rather broad and non-specific. Very different kinds of work may be done by bearers of the title assistant, clerk, officer, secretary etc., depending on the institution and the level of seniority. The thrust to replace sexist job titles with ones which are gender-free has produced some very abstract alternatives, e.g. server for “waiter/waitress” in Canada (Canadian English Usage, 1997), and cleaning operative for “cleaning lady” in Australia (Peters, 1995). See further under man. \n Where people are free to choose their own job titles (in private industry, and among the self-employed), you might expect them to be as specific as possible. But for some it’s tempting to find a euphemism to dignify the job with a formal name – and who are we to object if the makeup artist prefers to style herself a “cosmetologist,” and those who install burglar alarms as “security executives”?

Jonathon is a recent variant, borne by individuals christened under the influence of the new suffix -athon, which is a formative element in a number of recent English words (see -athon). Jonathon is certainly being seen in both American and British English. Database evidence suggests that it’s rather more common in the UK, since Jonathon/Jonathan occur in the ratio of about 1:35 in CCAE and 1:8 in BNC. More than half of the 200-odd examples in the BNC are embedded in transcriptions of speech, showing that Jonathon is the intuitive spelling for many transcribers – though not its correctness for the person referred to. Some of the instances in written texts are definitely mistakes by the writer/editor, witness opera director and connoisseur Dr Jonathon Miller, and publisher Jonathon Cape. Yet Jonathon Porritt (of Friends of the Earth) is correctly identified with -athon. Clearly it’s a detail on which editors have to check with the person, as with Philip/Phillip, Geoffrey/Jeffrey etc. \n With lower case, jonathan/jonathon are also alternative spellings for a red-skinned type of apple, helped by “greengrocer’s spelling” (analogous to “greengrocer’s punctuation”: see apostrophes section 4). This application of the name originated in the US in the 1870s. Most dictionaries associate it with Jonathan Hasbrouk, an American jurist who died in 1846.

The best journalism is interesting and original in its expression, making readers more aware of the resources of the common language. It is achieved most often in the personal editorial columns of newspapers, by journalists who enjoy the privilege of a guaranteed number of words in which to develop their thoughts. (Cf. the inverted pyramid below.) \n Bad journalism is hack writing with a witch-like power to turn anything into stereotyped dross, partly because it depends so heavily on clich´e (see further under cliches´ ). Predictable as the style is, it almost “writes itself.” Even the awkward three- and four-letter words which are the staple of headlines (such as ban, bid, leak, wed etc.) seem curiously natural in it. This is journalese at its worst. (See further under headline language.) \n Other hallmarks of journalese are the lumpish sentences with overweight beginnings: \n St Edmund’s Catholic Church Youth Orchestra organizer Jane Filomel . . . \n Keen amateur sports fisherman and union Vice President Jeff Bringamin . . . \n The vital information is all there at the start, but so condensed (shorn of articles such as the, a and connecting words) that it can generate its own ambiguities. However capacious the noun phrase is, there are limits on what it can effectively put across (see further under adjectives and noun phrase). \n The inverted pyramid (or triangle) undoubtedly puts pressure on journalists to present everything “up front.” This conventional structure for news articles probably dates back to tabloids of the early C20 (Ungerer, 2002), but gradually spread to quality newspapers in the 1930s. It requires the first, summary sentence to provide the essence of the whole event. This is followed by background information, and details which are increasingly marginal in importance. Readers are often conscious that they get less and less, the further they go in an article. \n SUMMARY LINE ON EVENT \n BACKGROUND DETAIL \n BACKGROUND \n D’L B’GROUND \n The inverted pyramid is certainly not intended to frustrate the thorough reader. Rather it’s to ensure that only less essential details will be omitted, if the journalist’s report is cut short by the subeditor through lack of space on the page."

		"title": "judgement or judgment",
		"explanation":"In British English, both spellings have their place. Judgement is given priority in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), which argues against the “unscholarly habit of omitting the -e,” while allowing that judgment tends to appear in legal contexts. New Oxford (1998) also endorses judgement, and its wide popularity is confirmed in BNC data, where it appears in twice as many source texts as judgment. It is of course the more regular spelling, maintaining the -e of the verb’s stem before the suffix -ment (cf. advertisement and others presented at -ment). Yet judgment has been in general use since C16, and was the spelling enshrined in the Authorized Version of the bible (1611). This early use helps to explain why it’s the standard spelling in American English. Judgment takes priority in Webster’s Third (1986), and dominates in data from CCAE, outnumbering judgement by more than 30:1. In Canada judgment is also the commoner spelling of the two, according to Canadian English Usage (1997), though both are in use. Australians however are more inclined towards judgement (Peters, 1995). \n International English selection: The spelling judgement is preferable for reasons of orthographic regularity, and its consistency with analogous words such as abridgement, acknowledgement and lodgement. Arguments based on its distribution are not so clear-cut, but judgement is the majority spelling in some English-speaking countries, and the minor variant at least in others."

		"title": "judicious or judicial",
		"explanation":"Though both link up ultimately with the work of judges, these words have distinct meanings. Judicial connects with the official role of the judge in phrases like judicial hearing and judicial procedure. It implies something done by a judge, or associated with the courts. Judicial is strictly neutral in its implications, whereas judicious is discreetly positive. It connotes sound judgement in any field of activity, from a judicious comment by a teacher, to a judicious withdrawal by an army commander. In principle, a judicial judgement is also judicious, but if the law is (sometimes) an ass, this cannot be taken for granted."

Junction is much more common and familiar from being used to refer to the place at which roads, railway lines or wires come together. The uses of junction start up late in C18 (two centuries after juncture) and gather steam with the industrial revolution."

		"title": "just or justly",
		"explanation":"As an adjective, just means “fair, impartial or right.” The related adverb is justly, as in: \n The commissioner dealt justly with their complaints. \n However just has other uses as an adverb in its own right. It carries several meanings, including “exactly,” “by a near thing,” “very recently,” “only” and “really” according to context, as in the following: \n It’s just what they wanted. \n The food lasted just long enough. \n They’ve just arrived. \n It’s just an ordinary day. \n The idea was just brilliant. \n In the first three sentences, just has an important interpersonal role expressing immediacy (see interpersonal). In the last two, just could be seen as a hedge word and a kind of intensifier (see under those headings). Some might argue that it’s redundant in such sentences, though it does contribute to their rhythm and emphasis. The examples also show that just works as a discourse marker, spotlighting the word or phrase following (see information focus). \n Using just with verbs raises a small point of style. British usage avoids putting just with the simple past form of verbs when it means “recently,” and prefers the compound form with has/have – at least in writing. It would be: \n It has just come through. \n not \n It just came through. \n Yet the latter idiom (without the auxiliary has/ have) is well established in North America and Australia. Even in Britain, the simple past verb can be used with just in any of several other senses. See for example the use of just = “only” in: \n For the British champion it’s a lean year – he just won two events. \n The meaning of just is intricately bound up with its context, so it seems unproductive to insist on using it to decide the form of the verb. \n ♦ For more on the choice between simple past and perfect verbs, see aspect section 2."

		"explanation":"Many loanwords beginning with a “k” sound may be spelled with either k or c. The k often comes with words of Greek, Arabic or Hebrew origin, and sometimes Chinese.

Among the following, only those in roman are more likely to have k spellings nowadays: \n kabala kadi kaftan kaliph \n kalpak kalsomine karat kathode \n kation kephalin keramic keratin \n ketchup kleptomaniac kola konk \n kosh kosher krimmer kris \n krummhorn kumquat kyanite kymograph \n Note that other letters also vary the spelling of some of those words. See under separate headings for cabala, caliph, carat, ketchup and kosher. \n The tendency to replace k with c can be seen also in the middle of a word: ikon/icon, okta/octa, skeptic/sceptic; and at the end: disk/disc, mollusck/mollusc.

But under apartheid it became a generalized ethnic insult (“Hey Kaffir, get out of the way”), and within South Africa its use is now an actionable offence. Expressions like “kaffir lie” are also unacceptable. There are however some ongoing uses of Kaffir, in the various compounds for things native to South Africa – flora such as the Kaffir lily / melon / lime leaf, not to mention kaffir corn (a type of sorghum, and the staple of kaffir beer). The so-called “Kaffir Circus” deals in South African mining stocks. In American English Kaffir can also be spelled kafir. \n Kaffir/Kafir is a derogatory word in Islamic culture for a non-believer: it originates in Arabic kafir (“infidel”).

In American English the more Arabic form kabob is still given priority in Merriam-Webster (2000), though data from CCAE shows that many Americans have also adopted the Turkish spelling (kebab prevails over kabob by almost 3:1).

		"explanation":"This Chinese loanword was koetsiap (“seafood sauce”) in the former Amoy region, and kechap in Malaya, for which the closest approximations respectively are catsup and ketchup. But the earliest English form of the word was catchup, where folk etymology is visibly at work, trying to make sense of an inscrutable foreignism (see further under folk etymology). Ketchup is the primary spelling in the UK, according to New Oxford (1998), and there’s scant evidence in the BNC of either of the others. \n In the US, usage has been more divided, helped perhaps by the fact that the two major manufacturers (Heinz and Del Monte) were committed to ketchup and catsup, as Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes. Dictionaries too diverge. Webster’s Third (1986) still gives priority to catsup, while Merriam-Webster’s (2000) makes it ketchup. But whatever their brand or dictionary loyalty, American writers now clearly prefer ketchup, which outnumbers catsup by 4:1 in CCAE data.

The Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) first record of the idiom comes from Dickens, in the form put the kye bosk on. It then appears in the more familiar forms kybosh (mostly in British English) and kibosh (in American). But kibosh seems now to be preferred in British English as well, by the evidence of the BNC."

		"title": "kind and kindly",
		"explanation":"Both these can be adjectives, with only a little difference in meaning between them. Both imply sympathy in the person to whom they are applied, but while kindly refers to a generally benign disposition, kind can be related to specific action. Compare: \n He took a kindly interest in my welfare. \n They were kind enough to drive me home. \n As an adverb, kindly expresses the meaning of kind, and so They kindly drove me home paraphrases the second example exactly. The adjective kindly has no accepted adverb because of the awkwardness of a formation like “kindlily.” Instead we say “in a kindly way.” \n Kindly also has formulaic roles, in courteous acknowledgements of someone’s actions: \n While I’m away, the Fathers of the Priory are kindly looking after things. \n The author has kindly agreed to give a lecture. \n And in polite requests and commands, where it’s synonymous with “please”: \n Kindly take your seats. \n Would you kindly take your feet of the chair. \n In these its function is definitely interpersonal.

		"title": "kind of",
		"explanation":"Singular and plural notions come together in kind of. It involves a particular class of objects as well as various examples we know. In formal English either the singular or plural is maintained through the sentence, in extended patterns of agreement expressed in the pronouns, nouns and verb: \n This kind of problem is one to avoid. \n These kinds of problems are ones to avoid. \n The second type of sentence with plural agreement turns the observation into a sweeping statement, overstocked with sibilants – which may explain why writers represented in the BNC make much less use of it than the first type, couched in singular agreement. (See further under agreement.) \n In yet other constructions with kind(s) of, plural and singular combine but with different communicative intent: \n These kinds of problem are to be avoided. \n These kind of problems are to be avoided. \n The first sentence entails an abstract/noncountable use of the following noun (“problem”), and helps to synthesize the discussion in argumentative and persuasive writing (see count and mass nouns). The second is simply a more relaxed form of the full plural construction, and tends to appear in interactive writing and live speech.Objections to these kind of have been stronger in the US than the UK, where Gowers (1965) felt it was one of the “sturdy indefensibles.” Yet its frequency in American English is probably not very different from that of British English. The ratio of these kind of problems to these kinds of problems is 1:3 in BNC data, and 1:4 in CCAE. Much less visible than either is the combination this kind of problems, found only very rarely in impromptu speech. \n Impromptu speech is also the home of a very different use of kind of, as a hedging device: \n It was kind of scary. \n Sergei and I are kind of symbols. \n It’s kind of evolved. \n As the examples show, kind of can be used to hedge almost any element of a sentence – adjectives, nouns and verbs. Its informality is underscored in the merged form kinda, with the same hedging functions: \n They’re feeling kinda hungry. \n Kinda is actually more common in fiction writing than in the speech transcriptions of the BNC. Like other nonstandard spellings, it lends informality to dialogue or narrative. The fact that it’s used in more than 80 British texts makes it more than an occasional Americanism. The extended form of this idiom kind of a (mostly used before nouns), can also be found in BNC data: \n a modest kind of a funeral \n a still, silent kind of a winter day \n into kind of a pre-60s effect \n Again the phrase smacks of laid-back conversation, not pressing the description too hard. The grammar is no more or less explicable than that of indefinite structures that are standard idiom, such as what kind of a / some kind of a / any kind of a.

		"title": "-l-/-ll-",
		"explanation":"Deeply embedded in English there are rules about doubling the final consonant of a word before you add a suffix beginning with a vowel (see doubling of final consonant). The rules are applied with reasonable consistency to most consonants, but l is hauled out for special treatment in British English in words such as traveller, modelling, totalled, creating anomalies which are largely shared by Australian and Canadian English. Approximately 80% of instances in Australian internet documents follow the British pattern (Peters, 1999b). In Canada final l is doubled more often than not, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998), though the pattern varies from east to west, and between book publishers and the press (Editing Canadian English, 2000), where the first have been more committed to doubling than the second. In American English the regular spellings traveler, modeling, totaled are preferred in all dictionaries, and are clearly supported responses gathered in the Langscape survey (1998–2001). Research by Sigley (1999) based on comparative corpora from the 1960s and 1990s showed that the American endorsement of single l had strengthened from 89% to 94%. \n The use of double l in traveller etc. in British style seems all the more erratic when you compare its non-use before other verb suffixes such as -ize (equalize, finalize, generalize). Add in nouns such as medal(l)ist and panel(l)ing which vary over doubling the l, while others like specialist or federalism never do. Some adjective suffixes such as cruel(l)est, marvel(l)ous, wool(l)en show variation, but everyone uses devilish. As these examples show, there is no consistency even in reserving double l for use before inflectional suffixes on verbs and adjectives, and leaving single l before derivational ones (see suffixes). Often it comes down to conventions for individual words. Word history may dictate the spelling, as with crystalline, crystallize and tranquil(l)ize. (See under crystallized and tranquilizer.) \n In American English all such words can be spelled with a single l, and inconsistencies are minimized. Yet because such spellings are identified with the US by regional labels in most non-US dictionaries (Canadian Oxford, New Oxford, 1998; Macquarie Dictionary, 1997), little attention is paid to their merit in terms of regularity. The single l spellings embody some of the most widely accepted principles of English spelling. Those who exempt words ending in l from the general rule make a rod for their own backs with any new words of this kind. New verbs are continually being formed from nouns and adjectives ending in l, to test our spelling principles. Should they be: \n initialed or initialled \n trialed or trialled \n credentialed or credentialled \n Even those who use British spelling may find that what seems “right” in travelled isn’t necessarily so in less familiar words. The longer the stem, the more cumbersome the double l seems. When it comes to paralleled, most British writers stay with single l (see parallel). Internet respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) were systematically more inclined than their paper-based counterparts to use single l spellings. \n Because this is such a productive point of English word formation, it seems important not to perpetuate and proliferate anomalies. Already it affects as large a set of verbs as the following: \n apparel barrel bevel bowel cancel \n carol cavil channel chisel counsel \n cudgel devil dial dishevel dowel \n drivel duel equal fuel funnel \n gambol gravel grovel gruel jewel \n kennel label laurel level libel \n marshal marvel medal metal model \n panel parcel pencil peril petal \n pistol pummel quarrel ravel revel \n rival shovel shrivel signal snivel \n spiral squirrel stencil swivel symbol \n tassel tinsel total towel trammel \n trowel tunnel weasel yodel \n Derivatives of all those such as bedevil, disembowel, empanel are also affected. The broadest rule of English spelling leaves all such words with a single l, and has been adopted in this book. \n International English selection: The practice of using single l at the junction between verb and suffix when there is no stress on the final syllable of the stem is familiar throughout the world as the US spelling. It is more regular than the double l, and natural for new and uncommon words. These are good reasons for using it in established words as well."

		"title": "lack for",
		"explanation":"The verb lack has always taken a direct object as in: \n For most of the game, Spurs lacked enthusiasm. \n This transitive construction is matched by the intransitive lack for, at least in negative statements such as: \n They don’t lack for activities and leisure pursuits. \n With IB and DJ, they will not lack for high-class cricketers. \n One could never lack for advocates in Rome. \n No-one could say the old baggage lacked for courage. \n The lack for construction seems to have originated in American English in late C19, and to have crossed the Atlantic during C20. British examples like those just quoted are to be found in both written and spoken sources of the BNC. There’s no suggestion in New Oxford (1998) that it still has an American flavor."

		"explanation":"Dictionaries all make lackey the primary spelling, and it was indeed the first to be recorded in C16 English.

Both spellings flourished in C17 and C18, but lackey seems to have become dominant during C19 for both noun and verb. Perhaps the French spelling seemed out of keeping with the servile implications of the word in English (see further under frenchification). With no examples of lacquey in the reference corpora, C21 dictionaries can safely discard it. R.I.P."

Compare the difference in: \n The table was laden with fine food. \n The table was loaded with fine food. \n In both cases there is a wonderful excess, but the word laden makes its appeal more aesthetic. Loaded has strong physical connections with the noun load, and with it you can almost see the table straining under the weight of goodies piled on it. \n Laden is the last remnant of an old verb lade, which otherwise appears only in the fossilized phrase bill of lading. It is increasingly a literary word, as is clear when we compare laden with cares, and loaded with responsibilities. Loaded is common and usable in many kinds of context, whether it’s a matter of carrying a load of ammunition, money, responsibilities, or in the colloquial sense “under the influence” (of alcohol or drugs), used mostly outside the UK in North America and Australia."

	{
		"title": "lady or woman",
		"explanation":"Several kinds of social change since World War II have impacted on these words, among them the liberation of women’s roles in society, democratization of the work force, and movements against sexism in language. All have helped to destabilize the choice between lady and woman. The values of courtesy and respect that have been invested in lady to underscore “la diff´erence” are now set against the view that these may serve to disempower women in an unhelpful gender divide. Add to this some skepticism on either ideological front about the motives of the other, and differing reactions from older and younger users of the language, and you have a recipe for hesitation. There are still formal and conventional uses of lady which are uncomplicated, but many call for second thought. \n The word lady comes in fact from humble origins in Anglo-Saxon, originating in the kitchen as (literally) “one who kneads the loaf.” A thousand years later it was “my lady” to whom tea and scones were served in the drawing room. Genteel connotations are there in its more generic use as well: She received the unexpected guest like a lady. The social graces attached to the word are of course underpinned by continuing use of Lady as a courtesy title for women at certain levels of the aristocracy in Britain, women who are the wives or widows of baronets or knights, and otherwise for those below the rank of duchess, according to Debrett’s Correct Form (1992). In other countries such as Australia and New Zealand where knighthoods have been awarded on the basis of distinguished public service, the title Lady is given to the wife of the recipient. \n Lady is also caught up in courtesy titles used for women in other hierarchies. Thus Lady Mayoress is used of the wife of a mayor, or (if female) the mayor herself: \n She will make an excellent Lady Mayoress and Chair of this Council. \n In Canada My Lady has been the conventional form of address for female justices of the superior courts. \n Ceremonial uses of Lady like these are uncontentious, as is its plural use in the formula Ladies and Gentlemen, used in polite address to a mixed audience. This socially unrestricted use of ladies is matched in the use of the singular lady (without capital) to women of any class or status whose names are unknown – in public situations when they become the focus of attention:  \n Give your seat to the lady. \n Would this lady like to join in? \n Come in, young lady. \n In examples like these, politeness is central to the use of the word, in both second and third person applications. That politeness may however be blended with heavy irony, as in Look where you’re going, lady! \n In occupational titles, the so-called “polite” uses of lady are increasingly questioned. Terms like cleaning lady/tea lady are too obviously euphemisms for the person who performs menial tasks in homes and offices. To feminist ears the titles also sound patronizing. Either way job-centred terms such as cleaner and tea attendant are preferable and more neutral. There are similar concerns over the use of lady in professional titles such as lady dentist, lady doctor, though these are also driven by the fact that the gender reference is gratuitous, when for most professional purposes the term dentist, doctor says it all. Steady increases in the proportion of women among the ranks of medicos make it no longer remarkable, and drawing attention to their gender seems to perpetuate older assumptions about gender-roles – about who does what in “normal” society. The same kind of problem can be seen even in polite reference to the fact that sandwiches for the church meeting were made by the local ladies. Perversely perhaps, the term may seem to imply that this is the proper role of women (to provide services), while their presence as members of local committees and boards is glossed over. \n These days, lady and ladies are subject to multiple interpretations, and on the printed page there is no face to show the actual intent (benign or otherwise) of the person communicating. Writers wishing to use it need to be very sure of their readers. In American English lady is becoming something like a “skunked” word, according to Garner (Modern American Usage, 1998), i.e. one whose interpretation is so polarized and disputed that the only safe tactic is avoidance. \n In contrast, woman is increasingly assured among the set of terms available to refer to female human beings. In older usage it was socially differentiated from lady, and its lower class associations are still there if applied to one’s hired domestic help: My woman comes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The implicit social gradient probably lingers most strongly in British usage. But in more egalitarian contexts everywhere, woman is usefully straightforward – unencumbered by genteelism and decadent social assumptions. Research by Holmes and Sigley (2002) based on comparative corpora shows a doubling of the usage of woman between the 1960s and the 1990s in written American English, and comparably high levels in Australian and New Zealand data. \n In major sports competitions, the “ladies singles” or “ladies open golf tournament” are now often referred to as women’s events. For feminists woman is the preferred term whenever it’s felt necessary to refer to gender, as in women writers, women in publishing (see Maggio, 1988). However, the principle of avoiding gender specification in professional titles still applies, as with lady. (See further under nonsexist language.)"

The geological meaning reached Britain not long after, and has taken over from landslip as the common term. In BNC data landslide in the geological sense appears in more than twice as many sources as landslip, though the latter survives in legal and technical texts.

Attempts to create a language academy in C17 and C18 Britain foundered for political reasons; and the American Academy of Language and Belles Lettres, founded by New York businessman William Cardell in 1820, lasted less than two years. Thomas Jefferson was invited to become its president, but declined, noting the dangers of trying to “fix” the language. The proper role of the language academy is always a matter of debate, as well as its membership and their terms of office (Peters, 1992). (Should the academy’s members be there for life, like the so-called “immortals” of the French academy?) Both membership and function have been key issues for the English Academy of Southern Africa founded in 1961, which reconstituted itself in the 1990s so as to represent a broader range of linguistic interests (see under South African English). \n In the absence of a language academy for English at large, the language has maintained its boundaries by consensus, and by reference to local or imported written authorities. These change generation by generation, allowing for continuous updating of usage norms and using newly developed linguistic tools. It may not be a bad alternative."

While large is the all-purpose adjective of size, as in a large apple/book/ room/building, it also serves as its own adverb in verbal collocations such as bulk large, grow large, loom large and the idiom writ large. \n Largely is exclusively an adverb, but has lost its connections with physical size or extent and gained a figurative role as in: \n Health campaigns have largely failed to change behaviour. \n You will be largely responsible for yourself. \n These show its typical use as a synonym for “mostly” or “chiefly.” Grammarians would debate whether it is a degree adjunct or a focusing device (see adverbs section 1), and there’s room for either interpretation.

But largesse has its following among American writers, and appeared in almost 40% of instances of the word in CCAE. Meanwhile British use of largesse was probably boosted in C19 by the taste for things French (see further under frenchification). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) still has the two spellings ordered as largess, largesse, but New Oxford (1998) prioritizes the second.

When they need it, American writers in CCAE again keep it simple: \n . . . the tow boat finally lassos us \n the cowboy who lassos dreams \n PDQ lassos laughs with “Oedipus Tex” \n Among these new figurative uses of the verb, lassos outnumbers lassoes by more than 4:1.

Fowler thought of it as “harmless pedantry”: see further under first or firstly."
	},
	{
		"title": "last or latest",
		"explanation":"These words are often synonyms in informal language, yet they can also contrast in meaning. When they do contrast, last means “final, the one after which there can never be any more”; while latest just means “the most recent.” The two meanings are enshrined in your last chance and the latest fashion. On this basis, someone’s latest book is not necessarily their last book. Yet the distinction is often blurred in comments such as: \n I like this book better than his last one. \n Out of context that sentence is ambiguous. Does it mean: \n I like this latest book better than his previous one \n or \n I prefer this earlier book to his final publication. \n No doubt your knowledge of the author referred to and his various books would help to clarify the comment. \n Last often equals latest in references to time: \n Last Thursday they signed the contract. \n During the last month we have taken on two new editors. \n In official letter writing, last is routinely used this way: \n As I said in my last letter. . . \n In such cases both idiom and context clarify the meaning, and there’s no reason to modify them.

The latest software from X suggests ongoing progress whereas the last software could suggest that the company has wound up."

See for example the late Italian film director, Federico Fellini. Just how long we should continue to use it after someone’s death is a matter of individual judgement. Quotations in Webster’s English Usage (1989) suggest anything from ten to fifty years. Comments on the “ever-to-be-lamented death” of Lord Nelson by C19 newspapers could be taken to extend the period even further. It seems a little superfluous to prolong use of the late for those whose deaths are well known, except that it serves as a mark of respect, as for the late Rev. Martin Luther King. \n The late is sometimes used to mean that a person’s term of office has ended, as in Chaudry, the late prime minister of Fiji. Dictionaries in Britain, Australia and North America all recognize this usage, though it bears some risk of misinterpretation. If the person mentioned is remote or little known, it is more likely to be taken as an allusion to his death rather than his retirement or removal from office. The point intended can be made more reliably with the adjective former or the prefix ex-, as in ex-prime minister Chaudry."

Some of them, like e.g., i.e., etc. are very well known; others like ibid., loc.cit., op.cit. are rare except in academic publishing, and are steadily being replaced (see under individual headings). But many still serve as useful shorthand, as the translations in the list below can show: \n c. or ca. circa “about, approximately” (with dates) \n cf. confer “compare” \n c.v. curriculum vitae “profile of [one’s] life” \n e.g. exempli gratia “by way of an example” \n et al. et alii “and other persons” \n et seq(q). et sequen(te)s “and the following [page/s]” \n etc. et cetera “and so forth” \n fl. floruit “s/he flourished” \n i.e. id est “that is” \n inf. infra “below” \n inst. instante “in the present [month]” \n NB nota bene “take good note” \n pro tem. pro tempore “for the time being” \n prox. proximo “in the next [month]” \n PS post scriptum “[something] written afterwards” \n QED quod erat demonstrandum “[that was the very point] which had to be demonstrated” \n q.v. quod vide “have a look at that” \n RIP requiescat in pace “may s/he rest in peace” \n sup. supra “above” \n ult. ultimo “in the last [month]” \n v. vide “see” \n v. or vs. versus “against” \n viz. videlicet “namely” \n Latin abbreviations are given stops according to whatever editing principle you use for English ones (see abbreviations section 2). In the list above, stops are reserved for lower case abbreviations, or rather the shortened words within them (e.g. al. but not et). When both words in the abbreviation are shortened it’s still usual to give each of them a stop, although the practice of working with just a final stop, as in eg. and ie., is on the increase. \n In older publications, Latin abbreviations were italicized like other foreign loanwords, but the tendency nowadays is to put them in roman. This is recommended for all by the Chicago Manual (2003); and by the Australian government Style Manual (2002) and Editing Canadian English (2000). However British style manuals encourage editors to use roman only for the commonest abbreviations, and italics for the rest. What is “common” then becomes the issue. In Copy-editing (1992), the set is defined as consisting of e.g., i.e., etc., viz.; whereas Hart’s Rules (1983) had it include others as well, notably cf., et seq., q.v. The question of whether to italicize v. when referring to legal cases is discussed under italic(s) section 6b. \n ♦ For the question as to where Latin abbreviations like e.g., etc., i.e. are appropriate, and what punctuation to use with them, see under the individual entries."

		"title": "latinization",
		"explanation":"The influence of Latin is far greater than that of any other language from which English has borrowed. Along with hundreds of thousands of Latin loanwords came exotic patterns of spelling and affixation, now embedded as alternative systems in English (see for example ae/e and Latin plurals). Some of these were actively affirmed in Renaissance English (see spelling section 1), and their effect is still felt in such things as the variation between inquire and enquire, where the process of latinization is incomplete (see under inquiry and en-/in-). In scientific discourse, especially life sciences and mathematics, Latin influence is still visible in the preferred plurals for many neoclassical nouns, which resist assimilation to the English pattern (Peters, 2001a). \n Examples of affirmative latinization can be found in less specialized vocabulary. Flotation is a respelling of floatation, formed in English, and has all but replaced it (see flotation). English suffixes with Latin counterparts may be replaced by them, which explains the variation in words such as convener/convenor, deductable/deductible and others. All these were formed in modern English, but they have been, are being, or tend to be respelled with the Latin suffix – especially in North America – as if they had much longer pedigrees (see further under -er/-or and -able/-ible and individual headings). This use of latinate spellings in English formations shows the power of linguistic analogy, and the long shadow of our classical heritage."

In data from CCAE, the two terms are more or less equally common overall, and often used interchangeably as adjective and noun, compare: \n Hispanics are angry because these errors come at a time when many Latino groups have made a concerted effort to register . . . \n . . . urging Latinos to bypass voting for certain Democrats because they feel the party snubbed Hispanic candidates \n Latino is nevertheless the commoner term on the west coast (and for the Los Angeles Times), whereas the major east coast newspapers (Christian Science Monitor, Washington Post) seem to prefer Hispanic (see under that heading).

Laundromat was the trade mark (1943) of the commercial-sized washing machines at the heart of the business, and some writers capitalize the word even in generic references: we can always work at a Laundromat. But less than half of the 120 instances in CCAE carry a capital. Laundermat is a rare alternative, never capitalized. In Canada and Australia, where laundromat is also the standard term, the word appears without capital in the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n Despite appearances, launderette is not a French loanword (since the French use laverie automatique for the same business). Launderette was coined in post-war England (1949), with deliberate ambiguity no doubt in the suffix -ette, which could be interpreted as either “small” or “[substitute] female” in this context (see -ette). It has become the standard term for those seeking automated help with their washing, written without a capital as far as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) is concerned, and not normally capitalized by writers in the BNC. The two-syllabled form laundrette occurs a few times – apart from its appearances in the title of the movie mentioned at the start of this entry. But it’s very much the minority form, with only 1 instance to every 12 of those of launderette."

It could provide a name for that notional supra-regional variety of English of the northern hemisphere, consisting of the common elements of British and American English – otherwise variously called mid-Atlantic English or common English.

		"title": "lawyer, attorney, barrister, counsel, solicitor or notary public",
		"explanation":"The most general term for one who practises law in Britain, Canada and Australia is lawyer. In the US too, lawyer is widely used in nonlegal contexts, but gives way to attorney or attorney at law, in legal practice. The attorney general is the highest legal authority in the US, and elsewhere in the English-speaking world (Canada, the UK and Australia). But attorney is otherwise mostly confined to institutionalized phrases such as power of attorney. \n Outside the US, practising lawyers may be either solicitors who take on cases for clients, or barristers, those called to the bar to act in court. But within the court itself, the barrister is usually referred to as counsel (in Canada also counsellor), as also in the US. \n The term notary has a historical ring to it for Australians and the British, but continues in North American usage. The notary public is authorized to attest and certify legal documents such as contracts (including marriage certficates), deeds and affidavits, either as a public officer or in relation to private cases. An American lawyer is often also a notary public, and Canadians called to the bar are simultaneously sworn in as notaries public – except in Quebec where the roles are distinct."

The word was earlier used for railway sidings and side-canals in other transport systems. On newer highways the lay-by is usually not just a side lane, but a small landscaped area which serves a variety of social and other respite functions: at lunchtime they pulled in to a lay-by for a picnic. Elsewhere in the world the lay-by is a rest area, also called a rest stop in the US and Canada. \n In Australian English, lay-by refers to a system of buying goods under an installment plan. It can be used of the article bought, and even as the verb for buying it: I’ll lay-by it for Christmas."

		"title": "layman, layperson, lay person and laity",
		"explanation":"The term layman has been put under the spotlight, along with other generic compounds ending in -man, as being susceptible to sexist interpretation, whether or not that’s the intention. (See further under man and -person.) But unlike policeman, businessman etc. it can scarcely be seen as a source of discrimination against women in the workplace. It might indeed seem to discriminate in their favor whenever the phrase to the layman means something like “to the untrained.” Either way the nonsexist alternative layperson would serve, though it has yet to prove popular with British or American writers represented in the BNC or CCAE, where the ratio of layman to layperson is about 18:1 and 12:1 respectively. Layperson is however recognized in this generic sense in New Oxford (1998), Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie dictionary (1997). The Australian government Style Manual (2002) notes that layperson is in fact one of the best established -person words in the set (see further under -person). \n In its traditional sense, the generic layman stood for the laity, i.e. the nonclerical population associated with the Church. Both words embody the French lai, derived from the Late Latin adjective laicus, ultimately Greek laos, meaning “people.” This makes lay people a kind of tautology, though the terms lay person and “people person” are clearly distinct. There is indeed scope to distinguish between lay person and layperson, where the spaced form of the compound could refer strictly to a member of the Church, and the solid form to the nonprofessional in any field – of law, medicine, architecture etc. But distinctions based on space are always fragile, and the dictionaries that register both terms simply make them alternatives. This accords with the mixed evidence of the British and American databases, where layperson is occasionally used to refer to a nonclerical adherent of a church: a layperson with Methodist seminary training; and lay person in reference to other non-professionals/specialists, as in a panel of four doctors and a lay person. Still for secular references, layperson and layman are the usual choices."

The following are just a token: \n bustle drizzle fizzle giggle \n gurgle nibble rustle scramble \n scuttle shuffle sizzle trickle \n  twinkle whistle \n The source of such words is something of a mystery. In odd cases like dazzle we seem to have a diminutive form of daze, but the roots of most of the list above are obscure and unparalleled elsewhere. The consonants in them often seem to suggest the process they refer to, as if some kind of sound symbolism is at work. (See further under phonesthemes.) Some have a playful character, witness bamboozle and boondoggle (rare examples with three syllables), not to mention boggle, bungle, puzzle. \n 2 Two small groups of nouns.

The question itself seeks a yes/no answer, and people being questioned like this can all-too-easily compromise themselves, whichever way they respond. The most notorious use of leading questions is in courts of law, although the defense lawyer is entitled to object to “leading” the witness or defendant in this way. \n  The term leading question is also used more loosely to refer to any embarrassing or pointed question. So a government minister being asked about a confidential decision may resist by saying “That’s a leading question.” Yet it wasn’t, strictly speaking, unless the reporter’s question embodied the very information it purported to seek."

As in that example, the inflected forms do not require the final t to be doubled, and both Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) present them as leafleting, leafleted.

		"title": "leery, leary or lairy",
		"explanation":"Three different words, all of slang origin, underlie these spellings: \n 1 leery (or leary, rhyming with “weary”) meaning “knowing, sly” \n 2 leery (or leary, also rhyming with “weary”) meaning “distrustful” \n 3 leery (or lairy, rhyming with “hairy”) meaning “flashy [in dress].” \n The first leery connects with leer, a verb/noun of somewhat obscure origin, probably connected with Old English hleor (“cheek”), suggesting a sideward glance across the cheek that makes the beholder uneasy. It implies knowing something of which the beholder is innocent or unaware. This usage survives only in colloquial expressions like a leery grin, of which there are few examples in the BNC. \n The second leery (“distrustful, wary”) is widely used in the US and first recorded there in the 1890s, according to Barnhart (1987). But it seems to complement the sense of the first leery, and dictionaries usually present it as a questionable extension of it. (See reciprocal words for other examples where word senses can switch over.) Leery in this second sense commonly appears in the phrase leery of, and in a range of written styles in CCAE. Its productivity can be seen in a growing range of constructions in American English. Alongside leery of we find leery about, and on rare occasions it’s coupled with to or that (i.e. a finite clause). Other developments are to be seen in absolute constructions such as: \n I was a little leery at first. \n . . . has a way of making you leery. \n While optimism about Brazil has never been higher, some experts remain leery. \n Most uses (like all those noted so far) are predicative, but there are very occasional attributive uses (see adjectives section 1). Examples from CCAE include a leery attitude/the leery merchant, and creative compounds such as the libel-leery editor and investment-leery companies. All this confirms that leery is standard usage for American writers, whereas in Britain it remains slang, and scarce in BNC data. \n The third leery originated in Cockney slang, and has provided Australians with the noun lair (“a flashily dressed young man”), and the verb lair up (“dress up in bad taste”). This use of leery (lairy) is unknown in North America."

		"title": "Left and leftist",
		"explanation":"A capital L turns the common adjective left into a broad term for those whose political persuasion runs counter to the conservative establishment, either by being more radical or more socialistic. This usage derives ultimately from the arrangement of seats in the French National Assembly, where the nobles sat on the president’s right, and the members of the third estate (representatives of the common people) on the left. The term Left has long since ceased to be simply a term for the Opposition, since leftist governments take office from time to time. But Left/leftist do still seem to imply a dichotomy of the political scene, which glosses over the specifics of the alternative platform. Leftist first appeared in the 1920s, often juxtaposed with “communist,” which has tended to demonize the word – apart from whatever linguistic disadvantage it suffers through Left being the antithesis of Right. The generalized negative still seems to linger in political reports on how the rightist military fought the leftist opposition (in Chile), or Germany’s eco-leftist Greens. The latter does at least identify a more specific aspect of the Left’s position. But free-handed use of leftist seems to go with simplistic adversarial reporting of political situations at home and overseas. The fact that leftist appears 4 to 5 times more often than rightist in CCAE and BNC shows the asymmetry inherent in the use of such words. \n The Left (and Right) of politics are regularly capitalized, whereas the left/right wing would not be, according to the vast majority of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001). The derivatives leftist (and rightist) do without them, as shown overwhelmingly in data from CCAE and the BNC, and in accordance with New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster’s (2000)."

		"title": "legal, legalistic, legitimate or lawful",
		"explanation":"All four adjectives take the law as their starting point, but their connotations are rather different. Lawful is now rather formal and old-fashioned, being caught up in fixed phrases such as lawful wife or lawful business. It is often a reminder of traditional rights inscribed in the common law of the land. Legal is much more widely used to refer to any provision written into law (e.g. legal access), where a frontier between what’s legal and illegal is being defined. Other general uses of legal are its association with the administration and profession of law, as in a legal conference, a legal issue. \n Legalistic has a negative coloring. It implies an overemphasis on the letter of the law, and a narrow interpretation of it, with too little attention to its broader purpose or how people are affected by it. Legitimate has as many uses outside the law as within it. It can relate things to principles of logic and reasoning, as in a legitimate answer/argument/ conclusion; and its legal uses mostly relate to birthright, as in legitimate child/heir.

Canada has a House of Commons and a Senate, and Australia a House of Representives and Senate.

According to its sources legitimize has been about as common as legitimate (verb) since the 1970s. The trend has continued in the US, judging by the ratio of the two in CCAE, where legitimize outnumbers legimate by about 4:1. In the UK, the ratio is a little closer, judging by BNC data in which instances of legitimize (including legitimise) outnumber those of legitimate by more like 5:2.

		"title": "lend or loan",
		"explanation":"These are sometimes interchangeable, sometimes not. Only lend carries the figurative senses of adding or giving, as in lend strength to the cause or lend color to an otherwise routine event. But for other senses, as when property or money pass temporarily from one owner to another, either word could be used: \n I’m happy to lend him my car. \n I’m happy to loan him my car. \n In American and Australian English, the verb loan is readily used as an alternative to lend in such applications – but not so much in contemporary British English. The word was used in Britain up to C17, but a curious resistance seems to have developed there during C18 and C19, when the Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations are all from the US, and the word somehow acquired provincial associations. Fowler (1926) noted that it had been “expelled” from southern British English, but that it was still used “locally in the UK.” Yet Gowers writing after World War II found it returning to British government writing (1948, 1954), and weighs in against it in his 1965 edition of Fowler as a “needless variant” (1965). This seems to be the basis on which British usage commentators argue that loan must be used only as a noun (except in banking and finance), and lend as a verb. Some British dictionaries (Collins, 1991) and the Canadian Oxford (1998) still echo the inhibition, while data from the BNC shows that many British writers are comfortable with it. Among hundreds of examples, anything from crockery to the machete, from a video to a recording studio can be loaned – even people such as the schoolmaster to act as escort or the photographer from American Vogue. \n While loan as noun or verb can be standard usage for English writers in many places, lend is still largely restricted to a single (verb) role, at least in written English. In very colloquial conversation, it is also used as a noun, as in: \n . . . if I can have a lend of his dishcloth to wipe my fingers \n But the BNC’s handful of examples all come from spoken sources, and there are none in CCAE. \n Just why some words can appear in have a . . . constructions in standard usage, and others not, is quite arbitrary. (See further under light verb.) English allows many conversions of verbs into nouns (see transfers), yet there’s still a stylistic question mark about lend as a noun. It seems especially odd when both loan and lend derive from the same Old English word for “loan,” which was both a noun and a verb. Lend is a mutant of the older verb, formed in a southern dialect of Middle English, with a change of vowel and an extra consonant added on."

New Oxford (1998) and Canadian Oxford (1998) give priority to lenience, whereas in Merriam-Webster’s (2000) and the Australian Macquarie (1997) it’s leniency.

		"title": "less or lesser",
		"explanation":"The difference between these has exercised many a language watcher. Less is a comparative form of little, which makes lesser with -er a kind of double comparative. Both can appear before nouns, and older dictionaries classified both primarily as adjectives. Contemporary grammars distinguish more effectively between them, classing less as a determiner and pronoun, as well as adverb (see determiners). \n Less serves as determiner in examples like less exposure or less demand for premium beef, where it means “smaller in amount.” This is uncontentious, whereas its use to mean “fewer in number,” as in there were less objections, is still contended, despite being common in informal English (see fewer or less). Like many determiners, less is also a pronoun, as in less of a problem. Its other major role is as comparative adverb, and so it can modify adjectives (a less negative reaction), other adverbs (less rapidly) and verbs (worried less than before). \n Lesser is almost exclusively an adjective, meaning “smaller in status, significance or importance.” This is its meaning in a lesser god and the lesser demands of the weekend, as well as Lesser men would have rushed for the exit. Very occasionally lesser works as the adverb in compound adjectives: the lesser known town of Okayama. Note that it’s not strictly necessary to hyphenate such adjectives because the -er ending (like -ly) ensures correct reading of the compound: see further under hyphens section 2c."

Note however that some such “pairs” no longer pair up exactly in meaning. \n faithless (not keeping faith) faithful (loyal) \n  pitiless (showing no pity) pitiful (calling for sympathy) \n shameless (having no scruples) shameful (very regrettable) \n soulless (inhuman) soulful (with deep feeling) \n Not all -less adjectives have counterparts in -ful. Ones like fatherless, headless, homeless, toothless and wireless (originally an adjective) show how -less highlights an abnormal state of affairs, and we do not need a -ful adjective to describe the normal state of having a father, a head or teeth.

		"title": "lest",
		"explanation":"In the US, lest has been in continuous standard use through to the present day. In the UK it was on the stylistic margins in mid-C20, as shown by parallel databases of the 1960s, where it was five times more common in American than British English. It probably was “formal or archaic” then, as the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) declared. But BNC data from the 1990s shows a sea change in the UK, with hundreds of examples of lest from a variety of written texts. So its stylistic status in British and American English is much the same at the start of C21. \n Lest appears in two kinds of construction, to express: 1 a fear of some kind: \n . . . anxious lest Mitzi upset coffee over them both \n . . . feared to probe too deeply lest it should be disillusioned \n . . . worried lest pushing things too far led to quotas \n 2 a negative purpose \n Liberal commitment must also be tested, lest it become an orthodoxy. \n . . . passed the elephant house lest the irreverent onlooker should make comparisons \n . . . declined to give his view lest the debate became a test of loyalty \n The three examples of each show constructions with (i) the (present) subjunctive, (ii) the modal should, and (iii) the (past) indicative, which are found in that order of frequency in BNC examples. The modals might and would are sometimes used instead of should. The use of the present subjunctive with lest is one of the several constructions in which it has apparently revived in British English at the turn of the millennium (see subjunctive). \n In American English lest is used to express negative purposes and fears or concerns, just like those illustrated above. The CCAE data is however remarkable in that there are many examples where lest begins a sentence: \n Lest anyone think that . . . \n Lest it be assumed that . . . \n This very prominent use of lest might help to explain the idea that the conjunction is more American than British. At any rate such caveats are commonplace in ordinary American newspaper writing, whether or not they sound formal to British ears. But if lest seems to come up too often, writers can always vary it with in case to express a negative purpose or condition. See further under in case."

		"title": "let us or let's",
		"explanation":"The difference between these is largely a question of formality, as often with contractions. Compare the ceremonious Let us pray with the informal Let’s pray for rain. The uncontracted let us is useful in formal documents when writers want to maintain an authoritative tone while involving readers in the discussion: \n Let us now turn to the issue of accountability. \n Compare Let’s now turn to . . . , which minimizes the distance between writer and reader. \n Let us and let’s both invite readers to join the writer in the activity proposed, i.e. they involve you and us. This sets them apart from similar constructions exemplified in Do let us pay our way, where let stands as an independent verb meaning “allow,” and us does not mean “you” as well. The us in such a construction cannot be contracted without changing the meaning. Compare Do let’s pay our way. \n The pronoun used after let is always an object pronoun. In let us this is obvious, but not so much in Let George and us decide. Speakers are sometimes tempted to use Let George and we decide, thus changing the construction in midstream. \n In its negative form this idiom becomes either Let us not (go into that), Let’s not (go into that) or Don’t let’s (go into that). Once again they represent degrees of formality. The first has a slightly rhetorical flavor, which might be suitable for a formal document. The second is broadly useful for writing and conversation. The third is definitely chatty. Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes also let’s don’t as an American variant, though it goes with spoken rather than written discourse."

		"title": "letter writing",
		"explanation":"The questions asked about letter writing often focus on format and the formalities. Those things need attention but are really secondary to what the writer actually says and does through a letter. They are the primary substance of communication, through which a relationship is set up or fine-tuned. \n Letters are one of the few writing mediums in which you normally communicate with a single individual, either an acquaintance, or someone with a particular role. What you write in personal letters is a way of maintaining a particular relationship, whether intimate or more distant. \n When corresponding in the name of an institution to an unknown person, ideally you’re also establishing a basis for good relations with them. Institutional letters need to be positive in their tone as far as possible, and to offer a constructive exchange of information or points of view. Avoid correspondence clich´es and stereotyped phrasing (see further under commercialese). Correspondence which sounds like a form letter (or something drafted by a machine) is liable to alienate the reader. \n Letter formats matter most for institutional letters. For personal letters, do as you please, guided only by the level of formality in the relationship. But with institutional letters there are format decisions to make, such as whether to use semiblocked or blocked presentation, and open or closed punctuation. Both these types are illustrated in Appendix VII. The blocked presentation with open punctuation requires fewest keystrokes and is therefore the most cost-effective. Starting everything at the left-hand margin is easy to explain and implement. Yet questions about the look and readability of the letter also arise, especially in longer letters with extended narrative or discussion. Letter writers can and should adapt the standard blocked format in the interests of clear and attractive communication. \n The conventions for beginning a letter are also set out in Appendix VII. The salutation itself varies according to whether or not you know the recipient’s name. (See forms of address section 2.) The closing for most institutional letters these days is “Yours sincerely.” It can be used in any situation where the addressee is named in the salutation, and even when that person can only be addressed through their role (“Dear Manager” etc.). “Yours faithfully” is used only when the sender particularly wants to maintain a formal distance from the person addressed, and to emphasize that the correspondence is a matter of duty. See further under Yours faithfully."

		"explanation":"How to set isolated letters in print raises some questions, because they’re very slight, especially in lower case. Italics are recognized as the most effective device by the Chicago Manual (2003), despite the occasional use of roman. Usually the roman is supplemented by something else. Copy-editing (1992) notes the practice of using roman with inverted commas round the letter, and certainly “g” is more distinctive than just g. Whenever the letter is made plural, an apostrophe inserted before the s serves instead of inverted commas, and this too makes the roman acceptable, as in “dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s.” Yet even the apostrophe is unnecessary if italics are used and the plural s itself is in roman, as in: \n Dotting your is and crossing your ts. \n Upper case letters take care of themselves in roman: \n She had a curious record of three As and two Fs. \n Other conventions with single letters: \n * the letters used for enumerating a series may be either italics (a) (b) (c) or roman (a) (b) (c) \n * when indicating musical notes, a roman capital is used: middle C, the key of D minor. In the US, major and minor key signatures are sometimes distinguished by the use of upper case for the first and lower case for the second (Chicago Manual). The practice is rare in the UK (Oxford Guide to Style, 2002). \n * letters used to represent hypothetical parties in a discussion or points in a description are capitalized, as in: \n If A sues B for breach of contract . . . \n Let C be a point midway on the hypotenuse. \n * letters used to designate shapes are capitalized, as in: \n an I-beam a J-curve a U-turn a V-shaped valley \n For the printing of initials in personal names, and the punctuation associated with them, see under names."

		"explanation":"Despite the traditional British/American divide on the use of the ae digraph (see ae/e), almost a third of the British respondents to the 1998–2001 Langscape survey voted for leukemia. Their vote constituted 31% of the more than 700 British responses, showing the way of the future. The New Oxford (1998) gives them equal status as headwords (leukaemia or leukemia). The American preference is unequivocally in favor of leukemia, backed by 94% of respondents to the Langscape survey. In Canada leukemia is also standard, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998).

		"title": "levy and levee",
		"explanation":"These represent the same underlying French and Latin root lev- (“raise/rise”), borrowed into English for quite distinct purposes. Levy borrowed in C15 was the tax or manpower raised by government decree. The more French-looking levee was used in C17 English to mean a reception held by the king while he got up and was dressed for the morning. It was strictly for men, and this is still central to the word, though the court reception it refers to is now in the early afternoon. Quite independently, levee was borrowed into C18 American English, for the embankment raised along a river either by human efforts or natural processes. It is known but little used in Britain. In the BNC, examples of levee in the geological sense are confined to two texts – apart from a sprinkling of references to the Led Zeppelin composition “When the Levee Breaks.” All three words are pronounced the same way, stressing the first syllable."

Note that its use overlaps with likely to, but that liable to normally refers to a negative event as a general possibility, whereas likely to predicts either good or bad events on the strength of a specific past event. Compare for example: \n That horse is likely to win tomorrow’s race. \n In the pack that horse is liable to bolt. \n Apt to followed by a verb provides a usable alternative for many contexts, not just the colloquial: \n Employers are apt to underestimate the value of direct discussion . . . \n Unorthodoxies are apt to creep in from below. \n The idea that apt to can only be used of people is not borne out by BNC evidence, where about a third of all instances have inanimate subjects, like the second example above."

The verb is license, as in licensed to drive a truck, while licence is the noun: a driving licence (see further under driving licence). In American English, license is used whatever the grammatical role, and it outnumbers licence by about 150:1 in data from CCAE. Australian usage is in line with British, while Canadian is somewhat mixed – sometimes using license for the noun (Canadian English Usage, 1997), while licence is also used for the verb, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). \n The advantage of using license across the board is clear when the verb is used adjectivally, as in licensed premises. At that point other Englishes are quite unsure whether this is a verb or a noun derivative. (It could be seen as based on the noun licence plus -ed [see under -ed section 2], which would justify licenced premises.) In fact most British writers plump for licensed premises rather than licenced premises. The first reigns supreme in written texts in the BNC."

The Oxford Dictionary (1989) lists eighteen different spellings for it since C14, none of which is exactly licorice or liquorice. Common pronunciation still has the final sound as “sh,” and this shows in most of Oxford’s older spellings. Yet modern English has it as either licorice or liquorice, American dictionaries preferring the first, and British ones the second. Contemporary corpus data show an almost absolute divide, with 100% of American writers in CCAE using licorice and about 90% of BNC writers using liquorice. The Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) side with Merriam-Webster’s (2000) in giving preference to licorice. \n The spelling liquorice embodies folk etymology – a spurious connection with liquor. The word was originally Greek glycyrrhiza meaning “sweet root,” which became liquiritia in medieval Latin and licorice in Old French."

		"title": "lie or lay",
		"explanation":"The reason why people confuse these verbs is clear enough when you set their principal parts side by side: \n lie (1) “tell lies” lied (past tense) lied (past participle) \n lie (2) “be in a horizontal position” lay lain \n lay “put, place, set down” laid laid \n The different meanings of lie (1) and lie (2) keep them apart. But lie (2) and lay overlap in meaning and form, the past tense of one being identical with the present of the other. \n The essential difference between lie (2) and lay is that lay takes an object, i.e. you “lay something.” See for example: \n It lays eggs. \n They lay the groundwork for the future. \n In grammatical terms lay is a transitive verb, whereas lie (2) is intransitive – doesn’t take an object (see further under transitive). Without that point they are not easy to separate. Compare: \n They lay the groundwork for the future (= lay transitive, present tense) \n They lay on the ground while bullets whistled overhead (= lie intransitive, past tense) \n The transitive/intransitive distinction and the difference in tense serve to distinguish the two uses of lay. \n Despite these grammatical distinctions, the colloquial trend is to use lay (and laid) where conventional grammar would have lie (and lay/lain). It happens in the present tense with the casual \n If you lay down for a while. . . \n instead of \n If you lie down for a while \n In the past tense, the colloquial They laid on the ground comes up instead of They lay on the ground. For the past participle you’ll often hear I had just laid down when the phone rang, rather than I had just lain down when the phone rang. In fact lain has been falling into disuse since C18. The grammarian Campbell corrects laid to lain in the 1770s, attributing the mistake to French influence. Whatever the cause, the use of lain has steadily contracted since then. In standard C20 databases of 1 million words of British and American English (LOB and Brown), it occurred only 6 times in the first and not at all in the second. Lain survives now only in the most formal or literary style, and been lying (down) takes its place in everyday prose. \n The use of lay as the present of lie (and laid instead of lay [past] and lain) is common in casual talk in all English-speaking countries. Yet the standard forms lie/lay are still expected in the written medium – certainly in edited writing. We may speculate on when the pressure of usage will allow their replacements (lay/laid) to prevail in writing; but for the moment they remain markers of colloquial style. In the longer run they spell the doom of lie (2)."

In the earliest printing fonts, a small weak letter was often cast with a taller one to ensure that it stood in place during the printing process. Ligatures of c and t (ct) or s and t (st) were still quite common in C18. The other source of ligatures was the special vowels of Latin in which a and e or o and e were joined as a single character, although Fowler argued against them (see further under ae/e).

It simply registers the fact of the action (and its present or past tense), while the particular action is expressed via the noun – which is itself a transferred verb (see further under transfers). The noun is almost always prefaced by a. Some constructions are found with both have and take, like the example above, and in such cases British English is more inclined to have and American to take, according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). In Algeo’s research (1995) the difference proved to be a matter of relative frequency rather than an absolute divide."

		"title": "lighted or lit",
		"explanation":"These are alternative forms for two different verbs: \n 1 light “ignite” or “illuminate,” based on the noun light \n 2 light “get down [from a horse, vehicle]” or “land [on]”/ “hit upon,” based on the adjective light. \n Both verbs date back to Old English, and are among the few regular ones that have developed irregular parts in modern English (see section 9 of irregular verbs). Lighted was the original past form in each case, which was challenged by lit only in early modern English, in C16 for light (1), and in C17/C18 for light (2). In modern use lit has overtaken lighted, though in differing degrees in different places. Overall the use of lit outweighs lighted by about 2:1 in American data from CCAE, whereas in the BNC the ratio is more like 10:1. Despite its dwindling numbers, there are citations for lighted in all the same uses as lit: \n light (1) \n verb past: the tramp might have lighted (lit) a fire past \n participle: the windows were lighted (lit) \n attributive: with lighted (lit) cigarettes \n verb figurative: her pale uninteresting face lighted (lit) up \n light (2) \n verb figurative: the author has lighted (lit) on important new material \n But in BNC data the two forms are neck and neck only for that last construction, where lighted on and lit upon seem to be the preferred collocations – perhaps for reasons of rhythm. Otherwise lit prevails in the numbers stakes by huge margins. \n Americans are comfortable with either lighted or lit in all constructions, and likewise Canadians (Canadian English Usage, 1997). Australians agree for the attributive use (Peters, 1995), but they prefer lit when the word is part of the verb phrase. \n Lit has taken over in some compound verbs. Database evidence shows floodlit to be strongly preferred in both British and American English; and spotlit has a comfortable edge over spotlighted in the BNC. However in American data from CCAE, spotlighted dominates, and highlighted is preferred overwhelmingly in both databases. The verb moonlight uses moonlit and moonlighted for the different senses of the word (the literal and the figurative). See moonlight."

		"title": "like",
		"explanation":"Like is arguably the most versatile four-letter word in the English language. Or rather, it’s the coincidence of two words, one of which is the root of the verb “be favorably inclined to” and the associated noun, as in their likes and dislikes. The other like (“similar(ly)”) is the source of the adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and a noun found in set phrases: the like, the likes of (see like[s]). Like also serves as an interjection or pause-filler for some hesitant speakers: I wanted, like, to come and help. For younger English-speakers in both the US and the UK (Levey, 2003), like has also become a device for quoting someone’s words, as in He’s like “Who do you think you are!” which is beginning to be recognized in C21 dictionaries. But for writers, the main issues with like are its roles as preposition and conjunction, which have been the focus of persistent usage critiques. \n 1 Like as a preposition. While there are no strictly grammatical objections to using like as a preposition, concerns about its potential ambiguity have made it untouchable for some. The problem turns on a perceived difference between the use of like: \n a) in idioms and similes such as writes like an angel, built like a tank, where like is said to indicate “resemblance,” and \n b) when it introduces an example or two, as in great artists like Rembrandt or everyday chores like shopping and housework. \n Yet usage commentators are hard put to find serious examples of ambiguity between these uses of like (Burchfield, 1996); and even the more conservative American commentators (Follett, 1966; Bernstein, 1971) are disinclined to worry about it. In fact both uses establish a kind of archetype, the first by reference to the verb phrase, the second to a noun phrase. Distinguished thus by their grammar, there’s no problem in their both using like – and no need to paraphrase the first with “as” and the second with “such as”, as is sometimes recommended. The results of intervention can produce odd and misleading expressions as in “cleans itself as a cat” and “delicate problems as this are pivotal,” noted in Webster’s English Usage (1989). Like would be preferable in each case. \n On the stylistic front, like requires some care in comparative statements, to ensure that the items being compared are properly paralleled. The first sentence in the following pair achieves this, but not the second: \n Like Jane Austen, he creates characters from real life. \n Like Jane Austen, his characters are created from real life. \n Author is compared with author in the first, tightly worded sentence, whereas the second is loosely constructed and oblique in its comparison. Note also that when the comparison centres on a negative statement, the position of the phrase with like affects the meaning. See for example: \n Like Raymond, he would never react. \n He would never react like Raymond. \n The first sentence is about no reaction at all, whereas the second is about a particular kind of reaction. The like phrase in the second affects the scope of the negative. See further under negatives section 2. \n Comparisons with unlike raise the same issues as like, especially when linked with a negative statement: \n Unlike his predecessor, Rick didn’t want a huge office. \n Sentences like that are an obstacle course for the reader. (See further under double negatives.) \n 2 The use of like as a conjunction develops quite naturally out of its role as a preposition. Compare: \n The dogs were howling like wolves to the moon. \n The dogs were howling like wolves do to the moon. \n We accept the parallel roles of preposition and conjunction with other words such as before, since, than, so why not like? Shakespeare did not shrink from using like as a conjunction, nor did other writers up to and including Darwin. The Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) noted that like was used as conjunction by “many recent writers of standing,” in spite of being “generally condemned as vulgar or slovenly.” The evidence of its use abounds. Grammarian Otto Jespersen (1909–49) listed examples from well-published C20 writers such as Wells, Shaw and Maugham. The BNC provides hundreds of examples from written sources of the 1990s. Yet smaller British dictionaries such as Collins (1997) and New Oxford (1998) still keep conjunctive like at arms’ length, with the label “informal” or “unacceptable in formal English.” In American English it’s widely used, and there are thousands of examples in CCAE data from both high- and lower-brow newspapers as well as novels and conversation. American dictionaries record it with no restrictive label. Elsewhere the reaction is mixed. Canadians find it somewhat informal, according to Canadian English Usage (1997); but the Australian response is more accommodating. It turns up in various kinds of Australian nonfiction as well as fiction (Peters, 1995), and is only conspicuous by its absence from academic and bureaucratic prose. The climate of opinion is still the chief variable, rather than different degrees of use in different places. \n Among the various constructions with like, Burchfield (1996) thought that some were more acceptable than others – that its use to mean “(just) as” was better established in the UK than “as if.” Examples of each from the BNC are: \n a) I would wear a dhoti like they do in India. \n b) He starts giving out detentions like they were past their sell-by date. \n The “as if ” meaning is frequently blended with copular verbs such as look, feel, sound: \n It hardly looks like they tiptoed. \n My legs felt like they had been welded together. \n Should they sound like they have sand in them? \n The BNC contains hundreds of examples of these constructions, making “as if ” the commonest sense of conjunctive like in British English, as in American (Peters, 1995). \n With all this evidence of conjunctive use, like seems to have regained much of the ground lost to prescriptivist objections of C19 and C20. They were not in fact endorsed by Fowler (1926), who distanced himself from condemnation at the start with “if it is a misuse at all.” He invites “the reader who has no instinctive objection to the construction [to] decide whether he shall consent to use it in talk, in print, in both or in neither.” There never was a general principle as to why like could not be used conjunctively, and it is now strongly supported by corpus data from around the English-speaking world. Fowler would have smiled."

The two systems entail different punctuation practices, and details of layout are an issue with vertical lists but not horizontal lists. In both, but especially in vertical lists, it’s important that the items listed are parallel in their wording, and that a consistent style is maintained all through. \n  Horizontal lists are best suited for items that consist of one or two words. Those in the list following vary somewhat, and are close to the limits of what can be comfortably presented along the line: \n There are seven major newspapers in Australia: \n the Adelaide Advertiser, The Age, the Australian, \n the Brisbane Courier-Mail, the Canberra Times, \n the Sydney Morning Herald, and the West Australian. \n (For questions about the serial comma there, see under comma.) Such a list could be preceded by abbreviations e.g., i.e., viz., or the words that paraphrase them, prefaced by a comma (see e.g.). But there’s no punctuation at all when the list is the object or complement of the preceding verb, as in: Australia’s seven major newspapers are the Adelaide Advertiser, The Age, the Australian, the Brisbane Courier-Mail . . . \n The commas separating the items in those lists could be replaced by semicolons. Semicolons are essential when you need two grades of punctuation in a list, as in the following: \n Australia’s major newspapers are as follows: in NSW, the Sydney Morning Herald; in Queensland, the Brisbane Courier-Mail; in Victoria, The Age. \n (See further under semicolon.) \n 2 Vertical lists can be used for both shorter and longer items, and are generally necessary for the latter. They are much more often used in nonfiction than fiction or essays, so the decision to turn a set of items into a vertical list depends also on the genre. In informative (or instructional) writing, that list of newspapers could very well be presented vertically for ease of reference. In electronic documents designed for screen-reading, vertical listing is encouraged to promote scannability (see digital style). \n There are seven major newspapers in Australia: \n * Adelaide Advertiser \n * The Age \n * Australian \n * Brisbane Courier-Mail \n * Canberra Times \n * Sydney Morning Herald \n * West Australian \n Note the introductory colon preceding the list, and the absence of punctuation in the list itself, particularly when the items are prefaced by bullets. However a semicolon is conventionally placed after each item (and a full stop after the last one) when the items listed have internal punctuation or are substantial parts of sentences: \n Australia’s major metropolitan newspapers are as follows: \n in NSW, Sydney Morning Herald; \n in Queensland, Courier-Mail; \n in South Australia, the Advertiser; \n in Victoria, The Age; \n in Western Australia, the West Australian. \n The list also shows how the repetition of a small word (“in”) can serve as a listing device. In the same way “to” is often used to preface each of a set of objectives. The items do not need to be capitalized. \n Numbers and/or letters give more specific enumeration to a vertical list, as in the example below. They may be used alternately to distinguish the headings, subheadings etc.: \n Australia’s metropolitan newspapers are as follows: \n 1. Victoria \n a) The Age \n b) Herald-Sun \n 2. New South Wales \n a) Sydney Morning Herald \n b) Telegraph-Mirror \n Note that a closing bracket is all that’s needed with the enumerators in a vertical list, whereas they must be enclosed in a pair of brackets in a horizontal list. (See brackets section 1a.) The items in any vertical list should be worded in parallel, as in the second list above where each item begins with “in” and the name of a state. The list is then much easier to read. Nonconforming items need to be reworded to match up with the rest (so as to make them all verbs, or all nouns preceded by “the,” etc.). Consistency of wording in a vertical list is as important as consistency in the enumeration or punctuation. \n ♦ For the styling and setting of more extended vertical lists, see numbers and number style sections 6 and 7. \n ♦ For information about the indenting of items and runover lines, see hanging indention under indents."

		"title": "lite",
		"explanation":"This 1950s respelling of light has found a useful role for itself in identifying low-fat or low-sugar foods, and low-calorie drinks, especially lite beer. Lite also appears as a kind of suffix to refer to products that are lighter in weight than the standard: hence the types of footware named Trek Lite, Tennis Lite. Cutdown versions of software packages identify themselves in the same way: NetWare Lite, Z-Mail Lite. \n In North American English lite also has a generic role in referring to things deemed light-weight in terms of content and investment, as in references to the space program, where . . . shuttle “lean” is in danger of becoming shuttle “lite” – threatening the safety of the entire shuttle program. The phrase News Lite expresses concern about the excess of “soft news” i.e. personal news used to fill news programs, and the juxtaposition of lite beer, lite acting, lite thinking suggests a critical view of the commodification of art and public life. Yet lite is also used less judgementally, to calibrate levels of entertainment, as in nightclub lite, lite rock, and the Lite Chekov provided by a local repertory group. All these uses found in data from CCAE show that lite has a life apart from commercial nomenclature in the US, whereas it’s still confined to commerce in the UK, by the evidence of the BNC. Its generic uses make lite one of the very few respellings of a gh word to find a place in common usage. See further under gh and spelling, rules and reforms section 5."

		"title": "literally",
		"explanation":"This word has a split personality: plain-speaking and tantalizing. In its primary sense, literally urges you to take a fact “according to the letter,” i.e. word for word or exactly as the utterance has it. Yet for most of the last two centuries it has also been used to underscore figures of speech or turns of phrase which could never be taken at face value: They were literally green with envy. In cases like that, literally defies its literal sense and seems to press for factual interpretation of the idiom, however far-fetched. Readers are tantalized – caught between the urge to believe and disbelief. This use of literally is recognized in all major dictionaries, though some add cautionary labels or usage notes. New Oxford (1998) makes it a stylistic offence: “deliberate non-literal use [of literally] for added effect is not acceptable in standard English.” Examples of such use are readily found in BNC data, not in the most formal prose, but in interactive discourse both written and spoken, where writers/speakers are very audience-aware, and rhetoric overlays content. In media discourse, literally lends impact to quantitative statements (literally hundreds of calls) which do not bear scrutiny. It adds a hyperbolic edge to clich´es, as in: His death quite literally shattered the minister. Yet sensational examples like this don’t outnumber those of a more measured kind in the BNC; and it seems odd to censure the word on the basis of its less responsible users. In grammatical terms it’s an intensifier or emphasizer like “really” – whose use as such is registered without comment in the dictionaries. Webster’s English Usage (1989) leaves literally to the writer’s discretion, as do Webster’s dictionaries. Skilled writers anywhere can capture its essential meaning in serious or playful ways, as in the following from the BNC: \n  The glider pilot literally has the life of the tow pilot in his hands. \n Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars. \n Despite clich´ed use, literally still invites readers to savor the aptness of the writer’s terms of reference."

The word litterateur is masculine in French, its feminine counterpart being litteratrice.

In product labels it sometimes carries other senses of “low,” as in lo-cal (“low calorie”), and on the TV set with Lo, Mid and Hi controls. Lo (“low”) makes little showing yet in noncommercial writing.

In earlier centuries the words came from Latin and other European languages; and since the beginning of the colonial era, they are from languages of all around the globe. Loanwords often bring with them unusual spellings, such as the kh of sheik(h), or the accent of French garc¸on. These “foreign” features are slowly modified (kh becomes k , and French accents disappear), as the words become assimilated in English. In the same way, the foreign plural which comes with a borrowed noun (e.g. kibbutzim) is gradually replaced by an English plural with s (kibbutzes). These processes of assimilation are quite natural, and there’s no reason to preserve the foreign features of loanwords in English, or to continue to set them in italics once they are visibly anglicized.

Yet the printers / the cleaners and other such phrases often seem grammatically ambivalent, and able to be construed with a plural or singular verb (see agreement section 2).

Logotypes put together common sequences of letters, such as in, on, se, th. (They differ from ligatures, in which sets of letters may be combined for reasons of spacing: see ligatures.) \n In C20 English, both logotype and logogram have been applied to the distinctive sign or symbol representing a company name, though this meaning is now firmly attached to logo, first recorded in 1937. Logo is obviously an abbreviation, yet it’s unclear whether it derives from logogram or logotype, and with a dearth of citations from mid-century, the Oxford allows either.

The coin features a Canadian loon, an aquatic diving bird with a yodel-like call. The spelling for the coin varied at first between loony, looney and loonie (Canadian English Usage, 1997), but seems to have settled on the last. At the same time its meaning has developed so that it becomes the general word in financial reporting for the Canadian dollar, contrasting with the US “greenback.” Loonie and loony form one of the relatively few such pairs with different meanings (see further at -ie/-y). \n The words’ origins are remote from each other. Loony (“insane”) is an anglicized abbreviation of the latinate lunatic; whereas the loon from which loonie is derived is a reshaping of loom, an obsolete name for the bird, based on Old Norse lomr."

		"title": "loose, loosen or lose",
		"explanation":"The word loose is most familiar as an adjective meaning “slack or not tight” and “free or not tied up.” Examples of its use are to be found in a loose end, and Let the dogs loose. The latter idiom has effectively taken the place of the verb loose (“set free”), which was in use in older English, but rare nowadays. The verb loosen (“make less tight”) is by contrast very much in use, as in He loosened his grip on the rope. \n For centuries the verbs unloose and unloosen have doubled for loose and loosen. Their negative prefixes do not reverse the meaning of the root (see further under un-). Unloose is increasingly rare however, which explains why unloosen seems to do service for both, as “make less tight” and “untie.” \n “Loose” is also a common misspelling for the quite independent word lose meaning “suffer a loss” or “fail to keep.” While lose comes from Old English, loose is a Scandinavian loanword, but their spellings were unstable until C18. Lose has remained a spelling headache, because of the lack of spelling analogies for it apart from the pronoun “whose.”"

		"title": "lose out",
		"explanation":"Anxieties about lose out probably go back to Orwell (writing in English People, 1947) who used it to support a gross overstatement that “American[s tend] to burden every verb with a preposition.” In Burchfield (1996) it becomes a “slightly risky phrasal verb.” But we should ask whether lose on its own would serve the purpose in examples like the following: \n British children lose out in critical areas of education. \n Neither group of islands will lose out from this arrangement \n Lose out is effectively an intransitive verb meaning “be disadvantaged,” whereas lose itself is usually transitive. Being intransitive, lose out appears freely at the end of a sentence: \n Our viewers will not lose out. \n Its prominence at the end of the sentence, plus the fact that it looks like a “preposition” ending a sentence, would help to explain that ill-defined nervousness about using it (see prepositions section 2). Its origins in C19 America would also explain British resistance to it in some quarters. The BNC nevertheless contains over 250 examples of lose out / lost out, suggesting that it would be hard to give up."

		"title": "lots and a lot",
		"explanation":"These phrases serve their purpose when all you want is an approximate largish number or quantity. Both occur freely in BNC data, lots over 4000 times, and a lot more than 13,000 times. They appear in many kinds of prose, though not the most formal or academic. At home in interactive discourse, they come up in dialogue as well as unpretentious informative writing: \n We have sent lots of messages that we were outraged. \n Tests show that eating lots of fibre has as much chance of prolonging your life as wearing a wig. \n You went to a lot of trouble over the meal. \n It works in a lot of circumstances that defy the standard solution. \n As the examples show, both lots and a lot combine with plural count nouns or singular mass nouns. A lot also has a modest adverbial role: \n It’s been on my mind a lot recently. \n A lot and lots are labeled “informal” in modern British dictionaries, which seems to underrepresent the range of texts in which they currently appear. But if we assume three levels of style, including a stylistically neutral “common” category between formal and informal (as did the original Oxford Dictionary, 1884–1928), the status of a lot and lots can be better explained – as acceptable in informal and standard writing, but not the most formal. American dictionaries put no stylistic restrictions on them. \n Lotta as a merged form of “lot of ” is unquestionably nonstandard in terms of writing, and serves to represent nonstandard speech even though the assimilation it represents is very common and widespread. Both BNC and CCAE provide scores of examples: a lotta trouble, whole lotta action, lose a lotta business, save a whole lotta embarrassment; and it features in the titles of rock ’n’ roll songs such as “Whole Lotta Love” and “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On,” which again help to connect it with counterculture.

		"title": "loud or loudly",
		"explanation":"Dictionaries these days all allow that loud can be either an adjective or an adverb, in certain contexts So apart from qualifying a noun as in a loud voice, it can modify a verb as in: \n Don’t shout so loud! \n They turned the radio up loud. In the second case at least, loud seems to be the only possible word, and in the first it serves to make the imperative rather curt. Compare the more polite \n Don’t shout so loudly. \n Loud is also established as an adverb in idioms such as read/say/laugh out loud, where it replaces aloud. In BNC data, out loud appears more than 30 times as often as out aloud, and in CCAE out loud reigns supreme. The data show an increasing range of verbs coupling with out loud, beyond the familiar ones noted above: \n Nowadays people can speculate out loud. \n . . . tortured himself out loud \n He supposed out loud that 90 percent . . . \n In expressions like these, from both British and American English, the adverb loud refers to the physical production of sound in a situation, where loudly can be more detached and figurative, implying a social judgement about the use of voice: \n They complained loudly about their poor accommodation."

Drawing room and parlo(u)r generally sound dated. \n Americans also use the word lounge for a piece of furniture on which “one person may recline or several sit,” according to Webster’s Third (1986). The standard lounge in this second sense has a headrest at one end, which may or may not extend along the back.

But the second spelling can be confused with a different verb meaning “move down,” in less familiar examples.

The oldest of them luck (up)on meaning “meet [someone] by chance” has been used since C17; but its role is now challenged by luck into, originally referring to the lucky acquisition of something, and now also used in reference to people, witness: \n In the oil business he lucked into some money. \n Baker lucked into a big-name master of ceremonies. \n Luck out is a further contender in American English, appearing in the 1950s with the meaning “be lucky,” as in: \n I lucked out with really good people both times. \n This is its regular use in CCAE data, in a variety of spoken and informal written contexts. It puts luck out in parallel with luck into, both signaling good fortune. \n Yet those unfamiliar with the idioms sometimes take them to be opposites, and assume that luck out means “run out of luck.” The journalist who wrote of someone who “bad-lucked out of the prize winnings” was taking no chances. Some Canadians use luck in instead of luck out for this reason, according to Canadian Oxford (1998). Outside North America the idioms have yet to catch on.

In American English, a midday press conference can also be called a press luncheon / media luncheon, and the word seems to be more generally democratized than in Britain. The idea of a pot-luck luncheon (for American school children) might seem oxymoronic, though it goes with instruction in nutrition, and thus clearly differs from lunch spent milling in the playground.

		"explanation":"This ending serves both adjectives and adverbs in English. It is better known as an adverb suffix, as in coolly, excitingly, quietly, smoothly, where it has clearly been added to a simple adjective (cool etc.). Adverbs with -ly often show some of the standard spelling adjustments of English, such as losing the final -e of the adjective in cases such as simple-i-. Note also that adjectives ending in -ic usually add -ally, as with organic-organically. See further under -ic/-ical. \n In earlier centuries -ly was also often used to form adjectives from nouns, as with friendly, leisurely, lovely, scholarly. Sometimes an existing adjective formed the base, as in deadly, elderly, kindly, sickly. Such words are well established, and can be compared by just adding -er or -est, e.g. friendlier/friendliest, at least when they begin with no more than two syllables. (See further under adjectives section 2.) Note that adjectives ending in -ly do not usually convert to adverbs by adding another -ly. The awkwardness of formations such as friendlily is obvious, and so it’s normally replaced by a paraphrase: in a friendly way. \n A distinctive group of adjectives with -ly are those designating points of the compass, such as easterly, northerly etc., and those referring to intervals of time, including: \n daily hourly monthly nightly \n quarterly weekly yearly \n These serve as adverbs as well as adjectives. \n ♦ Adverbs which operate both with and without an -ly ending (such as [Go] slow/slowly), are discussed under zero adverbs."

Dictionaries allow the interchange of lyricist and lyrist, yet data from CCAE and BNC show that only lyricist is in current use, almost always applied to the author of lyrics for musicals or recordings – the heirs of Ira Gershwin rather than Shelley and Keats."

		"title": "Mac or Mc",
		"explanation":"How do you write the name of a well-known hamburger restaurant chain? \n McDonald’s MacDonald’s Macdonald’s \n The first spelling is the one used by the company, although the second or third spellings are also used by many people with the same surname – as a glance at the metropolitan phone book will confirm. Apart from those three spellings, there are two other ways of writing Celtic surnames of this kind: Mcdonald (which is rare by comparison with the other three above); and M’Donald, used in C19. M’ can still be seen in the names of Walter Scott’s characters, and sometimes in references to M’Naghten rules (a legal plea which seeks to defend someone on the basis of diminished responsibility). \n Ultimately, the decision about how to spell these surnames rests with the individual. Individual choices put contrasting forms of Mc and Mac together on the cover of a book, when authors surnamed McLeod or MacKenney are published by Macmillan. Yet there are some general trends towards one or the other spelling, in that Irish surnames seem to stay with Mc, as in McConnochie, McElroy, McEvoy; while Scottish names more often convert to Mac (with or without a following capital), and hence may appear in two or three forms, as in the McDonald’s example. Other things being equal, the commoner the name, the more chance of it being Mac. And mac (with no capital letter) is the spelling found in common words derived from Mc surnames, such as the verb macadamise (named after John McAdam 1756–1836). (See capital letters section 2, and eponyms.) In mackintosh, the common spelling for a “raincoat,” assimilation has gone one stage further with the insertion of the k to conform with standard c/ck rules. (See further under mackintosh.) \n 1 Geographical names based on Celtic surnames are regularly written with Mc in the US, spellings set by the US Geographical Names Board. Elsewhere in the world where pioneering Celts have implanted their names, it may be either Mac or Mc. In Canada the spelling of Lake McKenzie (Ontario/Saskatchewan) contrasts with the Mackenzie River (in the NorthWest Territories). Australians too cope with a varieties of Macs and Mcs, as for example with the McGregor Range in SW Queensland, MacGregor as a suburb of Brisbane, and Macgregor (ACT), all of which invoke the name of Sir William MacGregor, Governor of Queensland 1909–14. The variant spellings owe as much to the vagaries of tradition as to the particular person being commemorated. The benefits of standardizing geographical names with the Celtic prefix – as in the US – are clear. \n 2 Indexing names with Mac and Mc Both personal or geographical names with Mac/Mc raise questions of alphabetization, and how to integrate them with other names in an index. One system (A) is to list them as if they were all Mac, but with their individual spellings indicated; a second system (B) lists them according to their individual spellings. In either case, they are integrated with other names, and medial capitals are disregarded. When there are several cases of the same surname with Mac or Mc, the order depends on the initial of the first given name. \n Systems A and B are both recognized in the Chicago Manual (1993) and Copy-editing (1992). Though both incline to System B, Copy-editing makes it clear that System A is more helpful to those unsure of the exact form of the prefix for a particular name – which is why it’s used in telephone directories and atlas gazetteers. System B is preferable in book indexing, where it reflects the actual forms of names used in the text. \n A third system, sometimes used in short indexes, is to group the Macs and Mcs together at the start of the letter M,which is visible from where Mac and Mc would otherwise come up."

The word immortalizes the name of Charles Macintosh (1766–1843), an industrial chemist whose discovery of the process of waterproofing was patented in “macintosh cloth.” \n In the late C20, the name Macintosh was trademarked for a type of personal computer originating in northeastern USA. With its apple logo, it plays on the name of a late-ripening American apple, known as the McIntosh (red).

		"title": "mad",
		"explanation":"This word has covered a range of mental states from insanity to (foolish or excessive) enthusiasm to anger since the 1300s. But there are latter-day questions about its use – especially in British English. The use of mad to mean “insane” is not in question, whereas its use to mean “angry” was labeled “colloquial” in Worcester’s Dictionary of the English Language (1860), as well as the first Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928). A century later, the stylistic questions have faded in the US, while they have intensified in the UK. The New Oxford (1998) adds the label “informal” to mad meaning “carried away with enthusiasm” as well as mad meaning “angry.” Meanwhile Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000) present all uses of mad as stylistically unmarked and uncomplicated. Garner (1998) also affirms their acceptability. \n The stylistic dividing line between mad = “insane” (standard) and other uses of mad (informal) is problematic in at least two ways. The distinctions between madness, passion and obsessiveness are blurred in many idioms: \n It drives men mad but it’s the sensible thing to do. \n What makes me mad is the flippant desire to dismiss it as dead. \n Is not this bureaucracy gone mad? These idioms, and collocations such as mad panic/rush/scramble, and compounds such as money mad, aeroplane mad, music mad, all help to diversify the uses of mad, to mean something other than “insane.” They share the field with the sense “insane” in about half the instances of mad in BNC written sources. The fact that they appear in the same kinds of sources makes it rather arbitrary to say that one use is standard and the others informal. In any case mad is not the formal/professional term for “insane” used by psychiatrists. \n Close inspection of the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) note on mad = “angry” is also revealing. Alongside the label “colloquial” it notes that “in many dialects in GB and US [this is] the ordinary word for “angry.” The stylistic label thus turns on regionally preferred usage, and cannot be regarded as an international position. Data from CCAE shows that mad = “angry” is the dominant sense in the US, and it appears in many standard kinds of writing: \n Customers get mad at the credit company. \n Salas didn’t get mad, he got even. \n Two of the largest [theater] chains are already mad at Disney. \n The anger is underscored in expressions like hopping mad, boiling mad, steaming mad, fighting mad, kicking mad etc. Meanwhile in British English data from BNC, mad = “insane” is probably the most frequent of the three meanings – if we regard all uses of idioms like drive mad / gone mad as belonging to the “insane” set. This trans-Atlantic difference may well explain the intensifed comment on other uses of mad in recent British dictionaries. Yet British writers represented in the BNC do not share the dictionaries’ inhibitions, and are finding productive uses of mad in interactive writing. \n The idiom like mad has all the wild fuzziness of mad, and serves to intensify rather than clarify the process it refers to: \n People are spending like mad. \n Schools are competing like mad for pupils. \n If the rhetorical effect is all that counts, like mad will do. It does however suggest a gap in analytical thinking."

		"title": "madam, madame, ma'am and mam",
		"explanation":"These are all English renderings of the French expression ma dame, literally “my lady,” though as Madame it’s the common French word for “Mrs.” In English Madame and madam have quite different applications. \n Madam can be used freely as a polite way of addressing a woman whose name and status are unknown. “Would madam like to see the menu?” could be used by the waiter in an expensive restaurant; or the suggestion that “Madam might like to try a larger size,” by an assistant in an upmarket department store – at least in the UK. Madam also appears in the salutation of letters addressed to unknown female recipients, though there are other options (see forms of address section 2e). The title Madam lacks a plural of its own, though Mesdames would fill the need (see plurals section 3). The plural madams goes with madam as a common noun, in which case it means either: \n ∗ a bossy woman: She’s quite a madam to deal with. \n ∗ a woman in charge of a brothel: She had no prospects other than to graduate from tart to madam. \n The word Madame is used in English to preface the name of a celebrated Frenchwoman, especially one associated with the arts – Madame Pompadour, Madame de Stael, Madame Tussaud ¨ – or created by artists: Madame Arcati, Madame Butterfly, Madame Sosostris. It also serves as a courtesy title for female foreign dignitaries from any part of the world (Madame Phiroun, Secretary-General of the Cambodian Parliament), and for the wives of male dignitaries: the Dutch ambassador Jan Peeters and Madame Peeters. The English plural for Madame is like the French: Mesdames. \n The contraction ma’am (rhyming with “ham”) continues to be used in the US, in responses to instructions and questions posed by a woman: “Yes, ma’am, the docket’s inside.” Ma’am was once heard across the country, but according to DARE (1996), its stronghold is now the South and South Midland areas, in terms of frequency and range of uses. Garner (1998) associates it also with the Midwest and West. Webster’s Third (1986) notes that it may also be written as mam, but there’s no evidence of this in CCAE. \n In the UK, ma’am (rhyming with “harm”) is also widely used in courteous address to women but it emphasizes difference in social status: \n Special delivery, ma’am. \n “Your little fellow’s all right, ma’am?” the farmer addressed Biddy. \n Female police officers above the rank of sergeant are addressed as ma’am, and women of any rank to which one is junior, in the armed services. Ma’am (rhyming with “ham”) is the correct form of address when meeting the Queen or other female members of the royal family (Simpson, 2001). Mam can be used as an alternative to ma’am in direct address: Welcome, sir; welcome, mam. Note that it’s also a familiar or dialect word for referring to “mother” as in: He’d get his mam to do them. \n ♦ For non-European courtesy titles, see forms of address section 1."

		"title": "mafia, Mafia or Maffia",
		"explanation":"Italians write this as Maffia, but spellings with one f are standard in English – whether the reference is to (i) the Italian organized crime network, or (ii) its analogues elsewhere, or (iii) less sinister power networks in other domains. Yet while the first is clearly distinguished by the use of a capital letter, dictionaries diverge slightly on the second group. According to New Oxford (1998) the capital letter is also applied to Mafia-like organizations operating in the US – but not elsewhere in the world. BNC data confirms that both Italian and US Mafias are regularly capitalized; however beyond them there’s much variation: \n Columbia’s mafia \n the building boom organised under the power of the [Brazilian] Mafia \n a [Bombay] hawker has to pay off the local mafia don \n what he called the “Scargill Mafia” \n The quotation marks of the last example are a reminder that the line between mafia in the second sense (criminal activity, actual or imputed) and the third (sheer power) may reflect one’s socio-political persuasion. References of the third type are usually left uncapitalized, as in the British literary mafia, a great medical mafia, the sex magazine mafia. The lower case mhelps to identify these as figurative uses. \n In American English the pattern is similar, according to Merriam-Webster (2000), except that the capital letter is extended to all Mafia-like criminal organizations in the second set. CCAE data confirms that Mafia (with capital letter) is used for the Italian/Sicilian crime syndicate and its analogues in US cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. But look-alike operations elsewhere are as often lower-cased in the data (Turkish/ Albanian mafia). Perhaps this is a way of playing safe when the criminality of these more remote operations has still to be demonstrated in courts of law. It has the disadvantage of not distinguishing the dubious from clearly figurative applications of the word, as in “rain-forest mafia,” Hollywood’s “Irish mafia.” But with only two options (to capitalize or not to capitalize), it recommends itself in legally sensitive publications."

Late C20 citations from British and American databases run strongly in favor of maharajah, which outnumbers maharaja by more than 4:1 in the BNC, and 2:1 in CCAE. \n The wife of a maharaja(h) is a maharani, sometimes spelled maharanee, like other Hindi words ending in that sound.

		"title": "majority",
		"explanation":"When used to mean “larger number of people,” majority can take either a singular or plural verb in agreement: \n The majority of the party is/are still behind it. \n The silent majority is/are still a force to reckon with. \n Constructions with the plural are more common in Australia and Britain than in American English (see further under collective nouns and agreement section 1). \n Apart from the question of agreement, a curious restriction on the use of majority seems to have evolved during C20, by which only the first two of the following sentences is acceptable as “good standard English” (New Oxford, 1998): \n The majority of perennials flower during this period . . . \n The majority of people who have a church wedding . . . \n The majority of driving is done on motorways . . . \n The difference between the first two and the third is clearly not a matter of a plural versus a singular noun after majority, but rather whether the following noun is inherently countable. Collective nouns like “people” are, whereas mass nouns like “driving” are not. Gowers (1965) revising Fowler underscored the point that the item after majority of had to be “numerical” – disallowing the third type of construction, as well as the fact that dictionaries all define majority as “the greater number or part.” The definition allows for all three constructions illustrated above, and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) embraces them without comment. In fact most British writers represented in the BNC use majority of with plural nouns, yet there is a sprinkling of instances with a following collective or mass noun, like those illustrated above. They are rather more common in American English, by the evidence of CCAE. Parallel constructions such as the majority of the public / the majority of public opinion, and the majority of the money / the majority of its funding show free use of collective and mass nouns, alongside constructions with plural nouns. American commentators are not fussed about the issue. Webster’s English Usage (1989) sees the construction with mass nouns as a “reasonable extension” of those with a countable entity, and Garner (1998) makes no reference to it. \n Grammar apart, constructions with majority may seem a little heavy for the discourse. In sentences like those quoted above, most is normally enough to make the point. But that’s a matter of style, not correct usage, and there is no danger of misunderstanding."

Mal- is the French form of the same prefix, appearing in a few loanwords, and others created in English during the last four centuries. In C17 the French prefix was sometimes overwritten with the Latin, so mal- was written as male- in mal(e)government and mal(e)practice.

There are however some differences, in that malicious and malevolent are always associated with people and their behavior (malicious intent, a malevolent smile), whereas malignant and malign (as an adjective) are often applied to forces and circumstances. Further differences are that malevolent implies general ill-will towards another, while malicious suggests that the feeling is channeled into spiteful words or actions. \n Malignant is most often used of relentlessly destructive forces, as in the medical phrase malignant tumor. Malign has also been used this way in the past (malign syphilis), but nowadays it most often serves as a verb meaning “speak unfavorably of,” shown in He maligned all the people he worked with.

		"title": "man, man- and -man",
		"explanation":"For over a thousand years, man has carried two meanings: \n 1 “person, human being” \n 2 “adult male” \n The first meaning embraces the second, except where the context dictates otherwise. As often in language, the ambiguity of any particular word is resolved by others in the context. All this was taken for granted until the latter decades of C20, when feminist concerns were raised as to whether man was really being taken in its first, generic sense as often as was assumed. The debate drew attention to some of our oldest compounds, such as mankind and manslaughter. Were they interpreted in broad human terms or as “men only” references? Would it be a surprise to hear that a man-eating shark has taken a woman who was diving in the coral reef; or that a woman has fallen down a man-hole? \n Doubts about individual man- compounds are reinforced by the large set where -man is the second element, as in businessman, policeman, salesman. Outside the specific contexts in which they actually refer to men, such words are thought likely to endorse and perpetuate sexist ideas about social and occupational roles, and to make being a businessman an exclusively male preserve. Of course those who use such words may not be male chauvinists: sexism may very well be in the eye of the beholder. Some women indeed prefer to be called chairman, because it’s the usual way to refer to the role they are taking on. Yet many people feel we should avoid any expressions which raise such questions, and look for synonyms and paraphrases. \n For individual job titles there are usually alternatives which focus on the job and bypass the sex of whoever does it. So for example can be replaced by: \n businessman - executive, entrepreneur \n cameraman - camera operator \n chairman - convener, coordinator \n draftsman - drafter \n fireman - firefighter \n first-aid man - first-aid attendant \n foreman - supervisor \n insurance man \n  insurance agent \n juryman - juror \n linesman - lines worker \n mailman/postman - mail deliverer \n newsman - reporter, journalist \n policeman - police officer \n railwayman - railway worker \n repairman/ repairer - serviceman \n salesman - shop assistant, sales clerk \n serviceman - member of armed forces \n spokesman - representative (of) \n sportsman - athlete, player, competitor \n storeman - stores officer \n weatherman - weather officer \n workman - worker \n In some of those cases, there is an exact female counterpart to the male term, as with businessman/businesswoman, and the latter could be used when it seems important to identify the gender of the person concerned. Yet as a generic term, businesswoman is no less sexist than businessman. Better than either term would be one which covers both sexes, and satisfies the broadest principle of nonsexist language (see inclusive language). Some advocate the use of words ending in -person (e.g. chairperson), although they work better in some cases than others (see under -person). Note also the need to avoid -man in some nationality words such as Englishman. You could use either English person (if the reference has to be singular), or the English (for the plural/collective). \n When man- is the first element of the compound, satisfactory alternatives and paraphrases are not so easy to find. The following substitutes seem rather cumbersome and less precise: \n manhours working hours \n mankind the human race, humanity \n man-made artificial, manufactured \n manpower the work force \n We might also ask whether the original word really works to the disadvantage of women. Do such generalized concepts prejudice women’s chances of getting a particular job? The same may be argued in connection with certain conventional phrases containing man. Do they need to be paraphrased away? \n every man for himself everyone for themselves \n man in the street average person \n no man’s land uncontrolled or ambiguous area \n to a man to the last person \n Idiomatic expressions lose their vital connotations in a paraphrase. \n The hunt to eradicate man from the language is sometimes taken to strange extremes by those who find sexist problems in words such as manicure, manipulate, manoeuvre, manual, manufacture, manuscript. The first element in all those words is the Latin root man(u) (“hand”). The words have nothing to do with man (“adult male”)."

The name is borrowed from French, when mandarine was short for “Chinese [orange].” In other European languages, the orange is a “Chinese apple”: witness German Apfelsiene, Dutch sinasappel. In British English the fruit is occasionally spelled mandarine, in line with the French, but usually it’s mandarin, as elsewhere in the world. See further under -ine."

		"title": "mandatory, mandatary, and mandative",
		"explanation":"The first spelling mandatory is the common adjective meaning “obligatory,” as in a mandatory repatriation or mandatory comprehensive secondary education. Mandatary translates the Latin mandatarius (“agent”) in legal usage, and also serves to refer to a nation that holds a mandate over another, as decreed by the League of Nations after World War I. Thus the noun mandatary contrasts with the adjective mandatory – in theory. But the second is very much commoner than the first, which explains why mandatory is sometimes found for the noun, according to Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989). \n Mandative is mostly used by grammarians, to refer to the construction used after a persuasive word (verb, noun or adjective) which expresses the obligation in it. For example: \n I insisted that he explain things fully. \n Their demand that it be sent by return mail was unrealistic. \n It is vital that she speak for them. \n The verbs explain, be, speak in those sentences are mandative subjunctives.

		"explanation":"This Greek root means “madness,” but in English its meaning is more often “obsession” or “compulsion,” as in \n kleptomania megalomania pyromania \n Words like these imply a deluded or perverse mentality rather than one which is disordered. Perfectly sane people can suffer from regalomania (“an obsession with rules and regulations”). \n The meaning of -mania can be positive, as with bibliomania, where it simply refers to a passion for something. This is also shown in other recent formations with English roots, such as: \n balletomania discomania videomania \n Older words with -mania generate nouns ending in -maniac for referring to the person with the obsession or compulsion, as in kleptomaniac or pyromaniac.

For New Oxford (1998) manila is the only spelling, whereas both Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000) note manilla as an alternative. Paradoxically manilla is very little used in American English, by the evidence of CCAE; whereas the two spellings share the field in British data from the BNC, and manilla is actually a good deal commoner in transcribed spoken texts. This makes it the more intuitive British spelling, and it was in fact preferred by the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928). That apart, the similarity with “vanilla” and the bland color of manil(l)a paper may prompt the use of manilla. For more on the issue of single or double consonants in foreign loanwords, see single for double. \n No capital letter is needed when manil(l)a is used in reference to fibre products, pace New Oxford, since they have long since become generic, and all BNC citations are with lower case initial.

		"explanation":"The spelling manoeuvre seems to have an excess of vowels, but it’s the standard spelling for this French loanword in Britain and Australia, and more common in Canada than the other spellings, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). The spelling seems less awkward if you keep hors d’oeuvre in mind when writing it. \n Maneuver is standard in the US, making it a good deal easier for Americans to put on paper. However the use of e for oe will not appeal to those who associate this spelling convention with words of Greek origin, such as am(o)eba (see further under oe). The use of -er instead of -re is again the regular American pattern for such words: see -re/-er. In Canada a hybrid spelling manoeuver is occasionally seen (Canadian Oxford, 1998). \n When manoeuvre becomes a verb, the forms with suffixes are manoeuvred and manoeuvring. As an adjective it is manoeuvrable. For maneuver, the corresponding forms are maneuvered, maneuvering and maneuverable."

The metaphorical mantle which passes from one person to another is a symbol of authority – recalling the biblical story of how Elijah’s mantle was passed down to Elisha. \n A mantel is a shelf over a fireplace, often spelled out as a mantelpiece (or mantelshelf ). However the spellings mantle and mantlepiece are also sometimes used with this meaning, less often in British English (ratio of 1:10) than American (3:10), by the evidence of BNC and CCAE. \n Look back into their history and you find that both words derive from the Latin mantellum (“cloak”). The word was used in Old and Middle English with various spellings and meanings, and only in C17 did mantle become the regular spelling for the garment or covering, and mantel for the structure around a fireplace."

The Marquis de Sade has not become a marquess. American writers, more remote from the latest trends in aristrocratic titles, continue to use marquis for current British incumbents as well as others, and it outnumbers marquess by more than 16:1 in CCAE data. \n In English the wife or widow of a marquess/ marquis is a marchioness, a term which goes back to medieval Latin.

See for example: \n GW started to marshal his thoughts. \n Pick up your competition shirt from the beach marshal. \n Field Marshal Montgomery wrote breezily . . . \n  After centuries when either spelling was acceptable, the spelling marshal seems to have become dominant in C19, according to Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations, and in current British data from the BNC, there’s scarcely a marshall to be found. Webster’s Third (1986) allows Americans both spellings, yet usage data from CCAE makes marshal the preferred spelling (by about 5:1) for both verb and noun: to marshal votes; state/city fire marshal. \n Regional differences with marshal are most visible in the spelling of inflected verb forms, where the British have marshalled/marshalling and Americans prefer marshaled/marshaling.

		"explanation":"Showing who is master and showing that you are a master at something are clearly different. But there’s no simple dichotomy between masterful and masterly that lines up with it, pace Fowler (1926), who believed that masterful expresses the first meaning (that you’re in command of a situation), and that masterly is to be deployed when great skill has been demonstrated. Dictionaries register masterful in both senses, and data from the BNC has it used about as often in one sense as the other. Compare: \n D would clamp a masterful hand on A’s shoulder. \n He writes with masterful facility. \n Masterful appears in collocations where masterly might have been expected, by Fowler’s dichotomy, for example in masterful skill/performance, as well as masterful understatement. \n The wider scope of masterful is ensured by the fact that it’s the only one of the pair which can serve as an adverb: masterfully. Masterly, like other adjectives ending in -ly, cannot satisfactorily add on the adverbial -ly suffix, and so masterfully has to do service for both adjectives. In He had marginal talent which he exploited masterfully, we assume the adverb means “in a masterly way.”  \n Masterly and masterful are sometimes the focus of feminist critiques of language, at which point adjectives such as “skilled,” “accomplished,” “excellent,” “consummate,” “powerful,” “authoritative” are suggested as alternatives (Maggio, 1988)."

Webster’s Third (1986) endorses matrices; and though the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) gave priority to matrixes, the order was reversed in the 1989 edition, on the strength of numerous citations from mathematics and various new technologies including photography, computing and broadcasting. Most people are touched by one or other of those domains, and no strangers to matrices as the technical form of the plural. At any rate matrices reigns supreme as the plural of matrix in both British and American databases. Matrixes may be more often said than written, but there’s scant evidence of it."

		"title": "matte, matt or mat",
		"explanation":"British English often differentiates meanings with different spellings where American English makes do with one. So the British use matt (or mat) to refer to a non-shiny surface; and matte for \n ∗ the photographic and cinematographic technique of masking out part of the image on a frame or frames, so as to superimpose something else there \n ∗ the foundation layer in facial makeup \n American English uses matte for all these meanings, by the evidence of CCAE: \n The airport is covered in matte-finish steel. \n . . . awkward faking in the matte shot of Q and the fish in the same frame. \n Her matte cheeks were streaked with tears. \n Matte is the primary spelling in Merriam-Webster (2000), although Webster’s Third (1986) foregrounded mat, in line with earlier usage in both the US and UK. This reflects the word’s origins in French mat meaning “dead,” as it was borrowed in C17. The spelling matte is of course the feminine form of the same adjective, borrowed in C19. \n The noun mat (“carpet”) is quite independent, rooted in earlier English matt(e) which probably came from Late Latin matta."

The river is now known as the Menderes. Maunder means “talk in a rambling way, or act idly,” as in maundering through the interview. It probably comes from medieval French mendier (“beg”). Both words can be used to mean “wander aimlessly,” so you could say either: \n Tourists meandered through the market stalls \n or \n Tourists maundered through the market stalls \n There are still somewhat different implications.

		"title": "may or might",
		"explanation":"The choice between these two modal verbs is usually a matter of perspective rather than right or wrong. In simple statements this is certainly so. Both they may come and they might come are grammatically acceptable, and differ only in the fact that might makes the statement more tentative and the possibility more remote. The difference is more marked in polite questions: \n May I have a cup of tea? \n Might I have a cup of tea? \n In British English the first has long been standard polite form, and so the second seems overanxious to let the other party determine your right to the simplest of drinks. (In fact, even May I can sound overpolite, and Can I takes its place: see can or may). \n Grammatical issues weigh more heavily in the compound verb phrases may have and might have. Here the choice is sometimes argued as a matter of tense, given that might is historically the past tense of may and therefore appropriate alongside other past tense verbs: \n Whatever he may have said, he is basically loyal. \n Whatever he might have said, he was basically loyal. \n The here-and-now perspective of the first sentence contrasts with the all-in-the-past of the second. The verb tenses are consistent in each, shifted back from present to past, and present perfect may have to past perfect might have, if you wish. See further under sequence of tenses. \n But the use of might have in that second sentence also affects the meaning, making the possibility of disloyal comments more remote than with may have. Because might seems to foreclose on such possibilities, it is argued as the only logical choice in contexts such as the following, where the use of may have would be ruled ungrammatical: \n The girl may not have survived if the operation hadn’t been performed. \n Clearly the girl did survive, and might (not) have would have signaled the positive outcome up front. The writer’s choice of may have leaves the outcome briefly in doubt, thereby involving readers in the tension of the situation, though the meaning is the same in the end. This use of may have rather than might have is most often noted in news reporting, both in the UK (Burchfield, 1996) and the US (Webster’s English Usage, 1989). In the context of current affairs, may have lends a sense of immediacy which is valued more highly than other considerations. A polished sequence of tenses is a nicety, if not a distraction from the realities of the event. Readers with a firm grammatical training still tend to find may have awkward and/or reprehensible; yet for many, may is the modal verb of choice in these contexts, and unremarkable. \n Contemporary grammarians maintain that the tense distinction between may and might (and between may have and might have) has been largely neutralized (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985). The Longman Grammar (1999) regards these and other modal verbs as unmarked for tense, because their use so often reflects speaker/writer stance rather than time in the world being referred to. That apart, may is overall much commoner than might in nonfictional writing, according to Longman research, and becomes the unmarked choice between the two modals. Thus a complex of issues underlies the use of may have where might have could otherwise have appeared. Its use in formal prose remains answerable to questions of grammatical logic, but it can be rationalized in interactive styles of writing. \n ♦ For more on the uses of these verbs, see under modality, and can or may, and could or might. \n ♦ For may of and might of, see have (“Final notes”)."

		"title": "maybe or may be",
		"explanation":"The space makes all the difference. May be with space between the words is a compound verb, as in It may be vital, where may is the auxiliary verb (see further under auxiliary verbs). \n Maybe is an adverb meaning “perhaps.” It has a slightly informal character in British English, perhaps because of its frequent occurrences in conversation and “thinking aloud”: \n Maybe they’ll arrive tomorrow. \n In BNC data maybe occurs about three times as often in spoken texts as in written ones. This does not prevent it from appearing in various kinds of writing, except the most formal. Burchfield (1996) suggests that maybe has made a comeback in British English vis-`a-vis perhaps, and relatively speaking there’s something in this. In BNC data the overall frequencies of perhaps and maybe put perhaps ahead by a factor of 3:1 – whereas it was 5:1 in corpus statistics from the1960s (Hofland and Johansson, 1982). So maybe is not so far behind as it was, and being so often at the start of a sentence (about 40% of the time, in BNC data), it impacts more strongly on the reader/listener than it might otherwise. In American English the gap between the two has also narrowed over the last decades of C20. In the 1960s perhaps outnumbered maybe by a little over 2:1; they are now almost 1:1 in data from CCAE.

People sometimes replace it with myself, as if to avoid putting the spotlight directly on themselves: \n The chairman appointed myself to that position. \n There is no need to do this. In fact we draw less attention to ourselves by using the ordinary me: \n The chairman appointed me to that position. \n Anxieties about me probably stem from two constructions which are censured by the grammarian, though they are quite common in informal dialogue. One is the use of me instead of my as a possessive adjective (especially by young people), as in: \n I rode up there on me bike. \n Written down, this me seems ungrammatical (a first person pronoun where a determiner should be used). In fact it looks worse than it usually sounds – like my with a shortened vowel or schwa (see further under that heading). When scripting informal dialogue there may be good reason to write me or m’ instead of my, though it would be out of place or substandard in most other kinds of writing. \n The other informal construction uses me after and for a coordinated subject, as in: \n Jim and me left before the rest. \n Here me substitutes for I, and in standard grammar it would be Jim and I left before the rest. But in easy-going conversation some speakers use the object pronoun me whether its role is subject or object. This would reflect the more general trend among world Englishes (Wales, 1996) to use the object pronoun for all cases (see further under cases). But there’s a curious counterpoint in the way I is sometimes used instead of me when coordinated as the object of a preposition, e.g. for you and I, like you and I, between you and I. It may be a form of hypercorrection (see between you and me (or I)). \n Whatever the vagaries of me in casual speech, its use in writing is still complementary to I, as object and subject pronoun respectively. In noncoordinated constructions, the use of me is stable, and the I/me distinction is matched by we/us, he/him, she/her, they/them, though absent from you and it. For the moment there are more English pronouns with the subject/object distinction than without it. \n ♦ See further under I (“grammatical notes”)."

But in C20 it has been largely overtaken by the use of media to refer to the channels of mass communication, such as radio, TV and newspapers. The media, first recorded in the 1950s, is now a byword for the mass media at large. This collective usage of media not unnaturally couples with a singular verb from time to time, as in: \n . . . fears which the media has shamelessly played on \n The same idea could equally be put as: \n . . . fears which the media have shamelessly played on \n In BNC data, the two types of agreement are about equally common overall, and in spoken data the singular dominates. An Oxford Dictionary (1989) citation from 1966 noted the use of media as a singular noun “spreading into upper cultural strata” – a not-entirely neutral observation. The dictionary still labels such usage “erroneous,” though it makes media a headword in its own right. New Oxford (1998) moves things along one step with a usage note saying that media “behaves as a collective noun,” and is “acceptable in standard English with either singular or plural.” Webster’s Third (1986) lists it under medium, but allows that it is “sometimes singular in construction.” In CCAE the ratio of singular to plural is about 2:3. Yet neither the American nor the British database provides many instances that are clearly singular or plural. Over 80% of examples are indeterminate in number, many because they are attributive, as in media coverage, a media event, the media industry. \n This large-scale indeterminacy paves the way for the use of media as a count noun, as in a new recording media, and the corresponding English plural medias, both noted in Webster’s English Usage (1989). There are grains of evidence for both in CCAE: several examples of the type a media given over to press agentry, and the network news medias. Only the second type appears in the BNC (e.g. Ethernet medias). So neither is well established in print, nor yet registered in New Oxford (1998) or Merriam-Webster’s (2000). \n Media as mass media is thus on the cusp of switching from the Latin paradigm in which it was plural, to English uses in which it’s singular – a collective and even a countable noun. Dictionaries have been rather slow to endorse these developments, though the collective use of media supports plural as well as singular agreement, and thus embraces the traditional use. (See further under collective nouns.) \n Part of the fallout from this grammatical shakedown is that medium takes over the English plural mediums for all its purposes: \n ∗ the occult: manipulating spirits and demons with the help of exorcists and mediums \n ∗ in the arts: acrylic mediums, water-based painting mediums; the more inventive mediums of children’s literature \n ∗ general, as in mediums of exchange; water is the most forgiving of mediums to fall into \n ∗ ad hoc, in reference to the medium-sized: mediums priced at 120p. \n Though dictionaries still allow media as the plural for all but the first of those uses, mediums helps to distinguish them all from specific references to the mass media. The two plurals are now more strongly differentiated than for most other Latin loanwords ending in -um. See under that heading."

They therefore argue that it cannot be qualified by words such as “rather” or “very”: something either is or is not “in the middle.” (See absolute section 1.) For most people mediocre is more general in its meaning, just “ordinary and unremarkable,” and there’s no problem in qualifying the word with adverbs of degree. But it has become rather pejorative in most applications. Calling the recital “a mediocre performance” now seems to mean it was actually below average, i.e. “inferior.”"

		"title": "meet (up) (with)",
		"explanation":"For centuries the verb meet has worked simply and effectively, with no extra particles: \n We met the director in her office. \n They met at the bar after work. \n In grammatical terms the first sentence is transitive, the second intransitive (see further under transitive); but each is self-sufficient. The very simplicity of this seems to make English-speakers want to add to it, and many are inclined to use meet with as the transitive form, and meet up as the intransitive: \n We met with the director . . . \n They met up at the bar . . . \n Between the first and second set, there are perhaps some subtle differences: a certain formality about meet with and a sense of the importance of the encounter; while meet up seems to connote a more ordinary get-together, even by chance. These differences in connotation may justify their use on occasions, though meet itself would also be sufficient. \n British usage commentators sometimes present a different argument for avoiding meet with in the sense of “come into the presence of.” They find it unfortunate that this coincides with meet with in the sense “incur or experience,” as in: \n I hope it meets with your approval. \n She met with huge resistance. \n Yet dictionaries allow both kinds of meaning for meet with, and the distinction is clear from whether the object of meet with is animate (as with “director”) or abstract (as with “approval” and “resistance”). The two meanings are about equally common in data from the BNC. \n As if this were not enough, meet is quite often accompanied by up as well as with, when it perhaps means no more than meet in its simple, transitive sense of “encounter or come together with.” See for example: . . . \n no lack of opportunities to meet up with your contemporaries \n Perhaps there’s something more purposeful about meet up with than just meet, to justify the extra words. At any rate the usage is widespread – far from confined to American English, where it originated last century. There are scores of examples in the BNC, in both written and spoken texts; and it’s acknowledged in Canadian and Australian dictionaries. Although the use of two particles (up, with) after a simple verb may seem excessive, we take it for granted in quite a few other verb phrases, such as come up with and walk out on (see further under phrasal verbs). Their flavor is slightly informal, but they are established idioms."

		"title": "mega-, megalo- and mega",
		"explanation":"Derived from Greek, this prefix means “huge.” In physical measurements, such as those calibrated in megahertz, megatons, megawatts, mega- means exactly “1 million or 106.” It takes its place among the standard metric prefixes, represented by the symbol M (see Appendix IV). In the computer term megabyte, mega- equals 2 ex20. \n In other scientific and scholarly words, mega- just means “impressively large,” as in: \n megafauna megalith \n megaspore megastructure \n Megapod meaning “having large feet” can be applied generally in zoological description; whereas macropod (again literally “having large feet”), is strictly the term for members of the kangaroo family. (For other uses of macro- see under that heading.) \n Megalo- is an older form of mega-, which combines only with Greek words, as in megalomania, megalopolis, megalosaur. The older megalocephalic is being replaced by megacephalic. \n In the past, the words coined with mega- were scientific and scholarly. A few of them have however taken root in everyday English, as when the technical term megaton(s) provides a hyperbolic word for “a huge load of ”: megatons of work to do. Since World War II mega- itself has taken off as an intensifying prefix meaning anything from “vast in numbers” to “awesomely great or large,” as in: \n megabucks megadeal megadeath \n megadose megaflop megahit \n megamerger megastar megastore \n In words like these mega- clearly lends itself to reporting on the spectacular, and to promotion of larger-than-ever businesses. These ready applications are the launching pad from which mega becomes a word in its own right, a powerful adjective or adverb to be flung around in casual conversation: \n ∗ adjective \n a mega prize \n see mega forests instead of trees \n the mega money need to gain a foothold \n ∗ adverb \n to think mega \n mega rich \n mega lively hotel  \n These new grammatical roles are recognized in New Oxford (1998), Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Macquarie Dictionary (1997), though labeled “informal” or “colloquial.” Despite its meteoric rise, mega as a popular intensifier could suffer the fate of any overused word – a rapid decline into merely sounding dated (see further intensifiers).

The twin adjectives are reminders of the fact that there were once (in Old English) two verbs relating to the process of becoming liquid. They merged in Middle English, and both molten and melted were used as past participles for the verb melt in early modern English. The regular form melted eventually prevailed, as often when regular and irregular forms compete (see irregular verbs); and molten was confined to the adjective role, especially to phrases in which it combined with metals or other substances that are liquefied only by great heat. Earlier authors could write of “molten passions,” but that’s probably too much hyperbole for C21 taste.

		"explanation":"The Latin imperative memento (“remember!”) has been used in English for a token of remembrance since C18. Just occasionally it’s written as momento, a variant now registered in Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989), though it first appeared in the middle of C20, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). No doubt momento has been downplayed because the spelling obscures the Latin root mem- (“remember”) in the first syllable. It nevertheless reflects the way the syllable is pronounced in English – often with an indeterminate vowel. Momento also suggests folk etymology at work, aligning the word with momentous and the special moment, rather than the means of remembering or commemorating something. (See further under folk etymology.) But momento is still far from common in either British or American English, occurring in only about 10% of all instances of the word, by the evidence of BNC and CCAE. \n The plural of memento is usually mementos (not mementoes), by a majority of 72% in the Langscape survey 1998–2001.

In official references to such documents (both inside and outside the bureaucracy), memorandum is the standard form. It lends quasi-legal status to documents in Memorandum of Agreement and Memorandum of Association. In keeping with these formal roles, its plural is usually the Latin memoranda rather than the anglicized memorandums. Memoranda was supported by two thirds of those responding to the Langscape survey 1999–2001, and it’s strongly endorsed in database evidence from the US and the UK. CCAE has it in 73% of all instances of the word, and the percentage rises to 95% in the BNC. See further under -um. \n The abbreviated form memo nevertheless has a life of its own, going back over a century, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989).

Without their accents, they are easily mistaken for each other. One way to remember the difference is that menage ´ is like menial, and involves the humdrum business of running a household; whereas manege ` which embodies the Latin root manus (“hand”) has to do with handling a horse. \n Menage ´ also refers to the structure of a household, and the people who comprise it.

Here is a sample of them from the letter A: \n accomplishment advertisement agreement \n alignment amusement announcement  \n arrangement assessment \n Only a handful of -ment words are formed with English verbs, including catchment, puzzlement, settlement, and a special subgroup prefixed with em- or en-: embitterment, embodiment, encampment, enlightenment, enlistment. \n Most words ending in -ment can express the action of the verb they embody, as well as the product which results from the action: \n the development of the program a new housing development \n an investment in their future devaluing our investments \n The spelling of words with -ment usually means leaving the verb intact, as in all the examples so far. Verbs ending in -e retain it, in keeping with the general rule before suffixes beginning with a consonant (see under -e). Note however that when the verb ends in -dge, two spellings are possible, as with abridg(e)ment, acknowledg(e)ment, judg(e)ment, lodg(e)ment. In the Langscape survey (1998–2001) the spellings with -dge were endorsed by a majority worldwide, but not the American respondents, with whom -dg spellings are at least as popular. (See further under abridgement, acknowledgement, judgement, lodgement. For the spelling of argument, see under that heading.) \n Note also that -ment words based on verbs ending in l may have one or two ls before the suffix, as with enrol(l)ment and fulfil(l)ment. In Britain such words often have only one l, because of the current British spelling of the simple verb (enrol, fulfil). In North America the two ls of the simple verb carry on into the words with -ment. However the spellings forestalment and instalment reflect outdated spellings of the verb even in Britain.

It rarely appears yet as a simple verb, but that is presumably only a matter of time. \n Both Merriam-Webster (2000) and New Oxford (1998) allow that the verb may be spelled as merchandize, making it part of the large set of verbs ending in -ise which can also be -ize (see -ize/-ise).

In anatomical words such as metacarpus, metatarsus, metathorax, metameans “beyond” in a simple physical sense. Metabolism and metachromatism build on the idea of change.

		"title": "metaphors and similes",
		"explanation":"Metaphors are non-literal uses of words, and a life-force of language. They lend vitality to routine commentary on anything, as when a golfing shot is said to be “rocketing its way to the ninth green.” The metaphorical word “rocketing” brings lively imagery to bear on an ordinary subject. Metaphors help to extend the frontiers of words, beginning as fresh figurative uses, and ending up as permanent additions to the word’s set of meanings. The notion of seeking one’s “roots” and discovering unknown “branches” of one’s family are thoroughly established, and to understand them we do not need to invoke the “tree” metaphor on which they’re based. \n When metaphors like these become ordinary elements of the language, they are sometimes referred to as dead metaphors. Yet even dead metaphors have a phoenix-like capacity to revive, as when President Gerald Ford declared that “solar energy is something that cannot come in overnight.” The imagery in familiar metaphors is latent rather than dead. \n A mixed metaphor involves using two (or more) divergent metaphors in quick succession. Between them they create a dramatically inconsistent picture, as when someone is said to “have his head so deep in the sand he doesn’t know which side of the fence he’s on” – to quote Australian state premier Bjelke-Petersen, who knew how to use the mixed metaphor (or “mixaphor”) to divert and disarm those interviewing him. \n Metaphors, like most stimuli, need to be indulged in moderation: not too many at once, and none exploited too hard. An extended metaphor can work well provided it’s not used relentlessly. The effectiveness of the metaphor in the following passage begins to flag after the third or fourth attempt to extend it: \n The boss entered them for all kinds of new competitive activities. They were spurred into presenting themselves at the starting gate for every government grant (whether it was the right race or not), and feeling thoroughly flogged, they yearned for green pastures . . . \n Like the hard-worked public servants of that example, metaphors can be overextended. They then become too obvious, and run the risk of parodying themselves. \n Metaphors and similes. Metaphors work best allusively, likening one thing to another by passing implication. Their contribution is much less direct and explicit than that of similes. Compare: \n The ball rockets its way to the ninth green. \n The ball goes like a rocket to the ninth green. \n In similes, the comparison is spelled out in a phrase beginning with like or as, and the image it raises is set alongside the statement, not integrated with it as in a metaphor. But similes do allow for more complex comparisons which cannot be set up in a single word. For example: \n Conversing with him is like wrestling with an octopus. He weighs in with one heavyweight topic after another. \n Similes, like metaphors, can become regular idioms of the language: \n built like a tank \n mad as a hatter \n  charge like a wounded bull \n Some similes are common to all varieties of English, others reflect the regional context, e.g. the Australian mad as a cut snake. Everywhere they lend color to everyday talk. \n ♦ For the difference between metaphors and metonyms, see metonymy."

		"title": "metonymy and meronymy",
		"explanation":"Metonymy is a figure of speech in which you name something by something with which it is regularly associated. So the bar comes to stand for the legal profession, because of the railing in a courtroom which divides the public space from the area reserved exclusively for legal personnel. The press stands for journalists and reporters whose writing is made public by the newspaper press. A metonym thus often stands for an institution of some kind. They can also be used in reference to familiar practices. In the phrase on the bottle, the bottle is a metonym for heavy consumption of alcohol, just as (tied to) the kitchen sink represents the (typically) female domestic duties. \n Metonymy (which works by associated objects) should be distinguished from meronymy, the figure of speech which names a part of something as a way of referring to the whole.

		"title": "metrication and the metric system",
		"explanation":"The metric system of measurement was instituted in France late in C18, and originally standardized by reference to physical objects kept in Paris, such as the platinum-iridium bar for the metre. Following the international metric convention 1870–5, many nations in continental Europe and South America went metric. But English-speaking nations have moved much more slowly, and progress is still uneven in different parts of the world. \n ∗ In Britain the process of metrication began officially in 1965, and though the currency is fully decimalized, metric and imperial measures continue to coexist in many domains. The “pint” of beer is dispensed as a fraction of a litre, and goods sold by weight are costed by the kilo – though imperial measures die hard with some retailers. Most road signs give distances in miles, while the permitted lengths of vehicles are in metres. British engagement with the EU has provided greater incentives for metrication than ever before, though there are still strong feelings about abandoning “good old British feet” in favor of the metre. \n ∗ In the US, public use of metric measures is still not conspicuous, despite being legalized by Act of Congress in 1866. Attempts in the 1890s to make it the official system were resisted, especially by the manufacturing industries; and only now with the adoption of the metric system by the US Army and Marine Corps, and by NASA for their weapons and equipment, is there some pressure for a general change. The US Metric Board, set up in 1975, has responsibility for developing a national conversion program. \n ∗ In Canada the metric system was officially adopted in 1971, and is well supported in government, business, science and education, even if older Canadians feel a little disoriented. It was always a natural in Quebec. \n ∗ In Australia, the metric system was implemented very systematically following the Metric Conversion Act (1970), and there are now few remnants of the imperial system except in very specialized fields (see imperial weights and measures). \n ∗ In New Zealand, the Weights and Measures Act (1987) established the use of SI units of measurement: see next section. \n  The metric system is essentially the one based on the seven key units of the Syst`eme International (SI) des Poids et Mesures (“international system of weights and measures”). They are: \n metre for length \n kilogram for mass \n second for time \n ampere for electric current \n kelvin for thermodynamic temperature \n candela for luminous intensity \n mole for amount of substance \n From these SI base units, others – either decimal fractions or multiples of them – are named, such as the millimetre and kilometre. Apart from those, there are: \n a) two supplementary units, namely the radian (a unit of plane angle) and the steradian (a unit of solid angle); and \n b) the so-called derived units: ones whose values are a product of certain base units. The standard unit of area is the metre squared, while that of density is based on kilograms per metre cubed. Derived units with special names (such as the joule which calibrates energy, and the watt which calibrates power) are also calculated from a formula involving the base units. For the watt it’s 1 kilogram metre squared per second cubed. The non-SI units employed within our metric system are also defined in terms of metric units. Thus the litre, our measure of liquid volume, is defined as 10−3m3; and the definition of bar, used in measuring pressure, is 105 pascals. Other familiar non-SI units are the hectare, tonne, day, hour, minute and the degree Celsius. \n All the units mentioned so far are in general use, but a few others have become officially “declared units” for limited uses only. Examples are the knot and the nautical mile, for marine and aerial navigation as well as meteorology; the tex (a measure of linear density), used in measurements of yarns, fibres and cords; and the kilogram per hectolitre, used in measurements of grains and seeds. \n 2 Writing metric units. Both base and derived units in the metric system have official symbols, many of which are written with a capital letter because they are proper names. This applies to units such as the ampere (A), the joule (J) and the watt (W), as well as our scales of temperature: Kelvin (K) and Celsius (C). By convention the symbol for litre is L (also a capital, to make it more conspicuous than an ordinary lower case l would be). Other metric items written with upper case are the symbols for prefixes which express multiples of any base unit, including mega- (M), giga- (G), tera- (T), peta- (P), exa- (E). \n Metric symbols are never pluralized, whether they are upper or lower case. See for example: \n The generator’s output is 600 MW (= megawatts) \n The walk is 14 km over rough ground (= kilometres) \n But when metric units appear as full words, they’re almost always lower case (e.g. watt, metre), the only exception being Celsius. As full words they should be pluralized like ordinary English nouns with an s (e.g. watts, metres), except in the cases of hertz, lux, siemens which have no marked plurals. (See further under zero plurals.) \n Other points to note are: \n a) either full words, or symbols (not a mixture of them), should be used in any expression: either kilometres per hour or km/h, but not km/hour etc. The symbols lend themselves to use in tables and diagrams, and the full words are most likely in discursive text. \n  b) only one unit should be used in expressing quantities, i.e. not both metres and kilometres. The writer chooses the unit so as to ensure as far as possible that the numerical values are between 0.1 and 1000. So working in metres makes best sense if you’re comparing distances such as 75.2 m and 106.5 m. (In kilometres they would be 0.0752 km and 0.106 km respectively.) \n c) between the figure and the abbreviated unit of measurement, a space is needed."

They have traditionally been explained within a range of wavelengths, and the range itself has been shifting down the scale in dictionary definitions since the 1970s, from between 100 cm and 1 cm (Webster’s Third, 1986) to between 30 cm and 1 mm in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Whatever, the niceties of their length, microwave ovens are familiar in the kitchen nowadays, and the abbreviation micro- begins to embody the meaning “microwave,” as in micro-oven (NOT a very small oven). \n Other new meanings for micro- have developed out of its use to mean “amplifying what’s very small,” as in microphone and microscope. From the latter the prefix has come to mean “associated with the microscope,” as in microbiology, microphotography, microsurgery. The microdot, microfiche and microfilm all depend on magnifying processes to yield the information stored on them; and through this microhas come to refer generally to the vehicles on or in which vast amounts of data are stored, such as the microchip and the microcomputer.

Others use it for a geographical location in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, as for the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The term is also used notionally, as in mid-Atlantic English. In the UK this can refer to the pseudo-American accent used by British disk-jockeys and pop-singers. But among teachers of English in Europe, it constructs a kind of English common to Britain and North America – an amalgam of the two supervarieties which are increasingly in competition as models. Just what mid-Atlantic English would consist of is unclear, however. Discussions tend to concentrate on how to minimize the differences between British and American accents (Modiano, 1998), while the larger issues of how to bridge gaps in vocabulary, semantics and idiom still have to be worked out. For English-speakers and English-users in Asia and the southern hemisphere, mid-Atlantic English doesn’t quite sound like a lingua franca for the world, since southern and eastern hemisphere preferences are not apparently taken into account.

The word is related to military, and once meant literally “serve as a soldier, go to war.” Its current, metaphorical sense is shown in: \n Inequalities of power may militate against any real negotiation. \n But instead, you may see or hear: \n Inequalities of power may mitigate against any real negotiation. \n This presents a clash of idiom as well as problems of meaning, since in some contexts mitigate means almost the reverse of militate – to soften rather than intensify an effect.

No following particle is needed, because mitigate is a transitive verb. See further under transitive and intransitive."

		"title": "millenarian, millenary and millen(n)ium",
		"explanation":"In Christian tradition, The Millennium heralds the thousand-year reign of Christ on earth, anticipated at the end of the bible (Revelation 20:6–7). From this, millennium has developed the more general sense of a future “golden age,” in which every human ideal is realized. The latter meaning is at the heart of millenarian, both adjective and noun, which are used respectively to describe anything relating to the millennium, and a believer in it. The word millenary can substitute for millennium as well as millenarian. \n The single n in millenarian and millenary goes back to the classical Latin adjective millenarius, on which both words are based. Millennium with two ns is a neo-Latin formation dating from C17, formed from mille (“a thousand”) and -ennium meaning “a period of years” (cf. biennium, triennium). But the discrepancy between Latin and neo-Latin has helped to foster millenium, which appears in about 15% of all instances of the word in the BNC, and in 5 out of 11 of the Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations, though the dictionary does not acknowledge it as an alternative. According to Webster’s English Usage (1989) it’s one of their “best attested spelling variants,” though not recognized in Webster’s Third (1986). It does appear as the sole headword in several smaller dictionaries, including two by Longman in 1978 and 1981, according to Kjellmer’s research (1986) – probably not intentionally, but that’s part of the point. If other dictionaries do not yet recognize millenium as an alternative, we might well ask why not? Etymology is of course with millennium, but the strength of analogy is with millenium. \n In principle, the plural of millen(n)ium can be either the latinate millen(n)ia or the anglicized millen(n)iums. Yet database evidence shows that in the UK as well as the US, millen(n)ia outdoes millen(n)iums. In BNC data the ratio is more than 20:1, whereas in CCAE it’s around 6:1. See further under -um."

There seems little point however, when the figure is very wide of the mark: a millepede has up to 400 feet (200 pairs of legs) but nowhere near 1000. Though the Oxford Dictionary (1989) gave priority to millepede over millipede, the order is reversed in both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000).

Note also that minimal often has a negative cutting edge to it, which minimum as an adjective does not. Compare: \n They gave minimum time to their patients. \n They gave minimal time to their patients. \n The first sentence notes that the amount of time given to patients was only as large as was absolutely necessary, whereas the second seems to say that this was negligible and reprehensible. \n In British English, minimum is usually pluralized as minima, whether in scientific, mathematical, financial or legal contexts: \n a north-east south-west trending belt of inversion maxima and minima \n redundancy payments above the statutory minima \n Common usage does however allow minimums, as in the bare minimums.

In frequency they differ sharply. Minimize is quite common and minify very rare, appearing only twice in CCAE, and not at all in the BNC.

Or that the number of people voting for the motion was 3 less than the number who voted against it, so that the vote ran 11:14 against? \n According to the second interpretation minority means “the shortfall between the votes for and against.” In the first, minority just identifies the smaller set of voters, in contrast with the majority. This is certainly the meaning in: \n A minority of members wanted more frequent meetings. \n In phrases like this one, minority means “less than half,” and so in a group of 25 could be any number from 12 down. The inherent vagueness in this use of minority makes some people qualify it, as in “a small minority” or “a large minority.” Yet expressions like those are problematic in other ways: the first seems tautologous and the second contradictory. \n Problems like these with minority (and majority) mean that it’s best to paraphrase them whenever precision counts. For example: \n The motion was lost by a vote of 11 to 14. \n  (instead of “a minority of three”) \n Only about a third/quarter (etc.) of the members wanted. . . \n (instead of “a small minority”) \n Just under half the members wanted more meetings. . . \n (instead of “a large minority”) \n The use of minority with noncomposite items, as in “a minority of her time,” is sometimes challenged, echoing a reaction to the same kind of construction with majority.

		"title": "minuscule or miniscule",

Standard pronunciation leaves the second syllable rather obscure (an indeterminate vowel [schwa]); and the Latin diminutive ending -usculus is rare in the everyday vocabulary of English. Add to this the fact that its meaning “very small” connects it with the lively prefix mini-, and it’s clear why miniscule has become a strong challenge to the etymological minuscule. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) records 7 citations for miniscule since 1898, and Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes increasing use of it since the 1940s, in parallel with the growing use of mini- as a prefix. Miniscule makes up almost 20% of all instances of the word in both CCAE and the BNC. The proportion worldwide is larger: an internet search by Google in 2002 found it in more than 35% of all instances of the word. \n Whether miniscule is an acceptable alternative is still a matter of opinion.

That element is in fact the Latin root misce- (“mixed”), which is neutral in meaning. To skirt around the problem, less formal words have been coined on all continents, some of them euphemistic, some offhanded. \n Settlers in Canada, Australia and other parts of the British Empire shared an array of such words: colo(u)red (from South Africa); half-caste (from India); and half-blood, half-breed, half-white, mixed blood (from the US). Other terms such as metis (from French), ladino, mestizo, mulatto (from Spanish colonial territories) were also familiar, especially in North America (see individual entries on colo(u)red and Metis and metis). Terms such as quadroon and octoroon, with their built-in genetic analysis, do not appear to have been widely used. \n Most of the disadvantages of these words are avoided with terms such as part-Indian, part-Aboriginal and so on.

But the use of titles marking marital status is no longer in favor – except with older people – for various reasons. To some the distinction is invidious, because of the spinsterly associations of Miss; to others gratuitous and/or sexist. The alternative title Ms. is maritally neutral, and recommends itself to many women as well as institutions and the news media that refer to them. Coined in the 1930s (Baron, 1986), Ms. was taken up by American business organizations in the 1950s, hence its early connotations of “career woman.” Its feminist associations with the “liberated woman” probably owe more to the Ms. magazine launched in 1972. But these colors have faded as more and more women of many lifestyles adopt the title (see forms of address section 2). \n In American style all abbreviations with lower case letters are given stops, and the Chicago Manual (2003) uses Ms. and Mrs. alongside Mr., whenever titles are given. British style is to omit the stop with Mrs and Ms because they are deemed contractions rather than abbreviations (see contractions section 1). On this Canadians do likewise, according to Editing Canadian Usage (2000), as well as Australians (Style Manual, 2002). \n Note that Ms. is normally written with capital M and lower case s,which distinguishes it from the abbreviations for “manuscript”: MS or ms. (see further under MS or ms). \n ♦ For the plurals of Mrs. and Ms., see plurals section 3."

It comes closer to the Algonquian word from which it derives, rendered as mokussin in the Narragansett language, and mohkisson in Massachusetts. But for English writers there’s no motivation for the pattern of single/double consonants; and moccasin is just as plausible. It features in various American placenames from Georgia to California, including Moccasin Lake, the Moccasin Bends (of the Tennessee River), and Moccasin Creek State Park.

		"title": "modality and modal verbs",
		"explanation":"What is modality? It depends who you ask. Grammarians differ in their definitions of it, though most would agree that it’s the factor which differentiates the first sentence below from the two following: \n The books are coming tomorrow. \n The books should come tomorrow. \n You should check in the morning. \n The sentences all contain auxiliary verbs (are/should). But while the auxiliary are indicates purely grammatical things such as the verb’s tense and number, should expresses something of the writer’s or speaker’s attitude to what’s being stated. The second sentence shows the degree of confidence she expects others to have in it, and the third what she expects others to do about it. These extra dimensions of linguistic communication are what is now generally called modality. The two major kinds of modality shown in the second and third sentences above are distinguished by grammarians as the epistemic (concerned with the truth of a proposition), and the deontic (expressing permission or obligation). See further under deontic. \n The modal verbs form a large subgroup of auxiliary verbs. They are capable of expressing more than one kind of modality, depending on the sentence they occur in and the broader context of communication. Is it an exchange of information, or are people formulating actions in words, e.g. making offers or issuing commands? The sense of the modal verb and its force is interconnected with the use of the first, second or third person (see further under can or may, could or might). The verb must can express obligation or inclination with the first person, as in I must send them a letter; and necessity or prediction with the third, as in He must come soon. Contexts often determine the sense, though it may not be clear-cut. Complementary senses, such as permission/ possibility, obligation/necessity and inclination/ prediction are therefore grouped together in the table below. Even so the boundaries between some senses e.g. possibility and prediction are indeterminate. \n . The relative frequencies of the commonest modal verbs are indicated in terms of ratios, based on statistics from the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus. The frequencies of some are affected by the parallel use of quasi-modals, e.g. be going to alongside will, especially in conversation (see further under auxiliaries section 2, and future tense). The uses of modal verbs shown in the table are those associated with main clauses: others may be found in subordinate clauses. For example, the sequence of tenses in a particular sentence may dictate the choice (see under sequence of tenses). Compare: I will come with I said I would come. However discourse orientation can override the conventional sequence (see may or might). \n Modal verbs are fluid rather than fixed in meaning, and most have changed and extended their meanings over the centuries. Yet they are more rigid than any other kind of verb in their form: one serves for all persons e.g. I/you/he/they must. There’s no regular adjustment for tense even though there were once present/past contrasts among them (as with shall/should, will/would ). They have no infinitive forms. \n British and American uses of the modal verbs diverge a little, but the differences are relative rather than absolute. See under can or may, could or might, may or might, shall or will, should or would. \n ♦ For the use of double modals such as might could, see double modal. \n ♦ For the connection between modality and grammatical mood, see under mood. \n Using modals in communicating. In writing as well as speaking, the various shades of modality are enormously important. Speakers express and control relationships with each other through them; and writers use modals as a way of fine-tuning the factuality and the force of the statements they make. Modals are often used to modify claims which could be challenged or prove difficult to substantiate, as in: \n The number of applicants may go down next year. \n Inexperienced writers sometimes rely too much on modal verbs to cover themselves. Yet whether they use the same modal repeatedly, or “juggle” the set of modals that express possibility, it becomes conspicuous because the modal is always the first item in the verb phrase. A better stylistic strategy for remaining tentative is to include also modal adverbs expressing degrees of certainty (likely, perhaps, possibly, probably etc.) as well as downtoners. (See further under hedge words.) Rewording the tentative statement is better still, so that the terms in which it’s expressed are themselves appropriate and do not need to be toned down."

In C18 the spelling was neither of these, but mollusque, reflecting its French background. But the Latin stem mollusc- seems to have prevailed in C19 British respellings of the noun, and everywhere in the adjective. In New Oxford (1998) molluscan is the only form registered, and even Merriam-Webster (2000) puts molluscan ahead of molluskan.

		"title": "momentary or momentous, and momentarily",
		"explanation":"The adjectives momentary and momentous express very different meanings of the word moment. Momentary is strictly concerned with time, as in a momentary lapse of memory, while momentous picks up the idea of importance (“an event of great moment”), and is usually found in phrases such as “momentous event” or “a momentous occasion.” The corresponding adverbs momentarily and momentously contrast in much the same way, with their respective emphasis on time and importance. \n But for momentarily, referring to time has its complications. Fowler (1926) found it in competition with momently over two perspectives on the passing moment; and he tried to insist that momentarily meant “for a brief span of time,” and momently “from moment to moment.” Compare: \n The dancer pauses momentarily in a pose. \n Their excitement increased momently. \n The distinction is somewhat academic with the disappearance of momently from current British and American English (by the evidence of both BNC and CCAE). Yet there is perhaps some fallout in the fact that the sense “from moment to moment” is not given to momentarily in either New Oxford (1998) or Merriam-Webster (2000). The dictionaries agree that momentarily still means “for a brief span of time,” and databases show that this is the dominant meaning everywhere. \n Dictionaries also register a new meaning for momentarily, that of happening “at any moment.” For example: \n Beijing lacks only the formal approval of the board, which could come momentarily. \n The meaning originated in 1928 in the US, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and it maintains its place in American and Canadian English, while there’s scant evidence in the BNC of its use in British English. This explains why American pilots can safely advise passengers that “this aircraft will be taking off momentarily” – while alarming or amusing those who take momentarily to mean “for a moment” (it seems they’re not going anywhere fast!). But North Americans and others who use both the current senses of momentarily would associate them with different kinds of discourse. The number one sense (“for a moment”) goes with narrative and retrospective comment, whereas the second “(at any moment”) goes with prospective statements."

But like many such pairs, monarchic and monarchical do not differ in meaning (see further under -ic/-ical). And since the second pair embrace the meaning of the first, it’s no surprise that occurrences of monarchic(al) considerably outnumber those of monarch(i)al, by more than 4:1 in both BNC and CCAE. Merriam-Webster (2000) gives preference to monarchical over monarchic, which corresponds exactly with their relative frequency in both American and British databases, where the first again outnumbers the second by more than 4:1. Fowler declared monarchial to be a superfluous variant of monarchal, though only the first makes a (small) showing in BNC data. Both forms appear in CCAE, but also in such small numbers that they hardly count. All this tends to make monarchical the lone survivor of a diversified set of adjectives, whose raison d’ˆetre has declined with the reduced status and functions of monarchy everywhere."

(See further under count and mass nouns.) For example: \n We cannot reclaim any moneys already paid to you. \n The regular spelling moneys is given preference over monies in all dictionaries, in line with other words ending in -ey (see under -y>-i-). Yet general usage in both the UK and the US is clearly in favor of monies, and it’s no longer the unusual spelling of legal and financial documents. In BNC data monies appears in about 75% of all instances of the word, and in CCAE it’s close to 95%. \n When money becomes a verb, the dictionaries’ preferred spelling is once again the regular moneyed, and this does have majority support over monied among both British and American writers, by about 3:2 in data from the BNC and CCAE.

		"explanation":"In the grammars of Latin and Greek, mood referred to the different forms of the verb used according to whether a fact or hypothesis was being expressed. The term was borrowed by traditional grammarians for English, as a means to distinguish the indicative, subjunctive and imperative forms of verbs: \n ∗ indicative (making factual statements) They are there. \n  ∗ imperative (issuing commands) Be there! \n ∗ subjunctive (expressing wishes or hypothetical statements) If only I were there. Were I there it would all be easier! Some grammarians would include the interrogative (where the verb is inverted: Are they there? ). A few also count the infinitive among the moods of English (e.g. [to] be). \n Nowadays the usefulness of the notion of mood for English is seriously questioned. Except with the verb be, the different forms of verbs do not correspond in a regular way to the expressive functions of clauses and sentences. In fact the expressive function seems much more important, and the set of clause functions now usually recognized (in the Comprehensive Grammar, 1985, and the Longman Grammar, (1999) is: \n  declarative imperative \n interrogative exclamative \n The meanings expressed through the different moods of the verb in classical languages are typically expressed through auxiliaries and modal verbs in English.

Its use is reinforced by the need to reserve moonlighted for the past of the compound verb moonlight (“work as a second job”), first recorded in 1957. Moonlighting in the past tense is always spelled moonlighted in both the US and the UK, witness: \n  . . . a police officer who moonlighted as a hotel security guard \n . . . he moonlighted as a lion tamer to make ends meet \n The two forms moonlighted and moonlit distinguish thus between hard work and serious play carried out in the darker hours."

		"title": "moral, morals, morality and morale",
		"explanation":"The adjective moral has two major senses, the older and more central of which is “discriminating between right and wrong.” This is also enshrined in the plural form morals, and the C14 noun morality. The morality plays and other improving literature gave rise to the notion of the moral of the story, the moral lesson which it embodies. \n In another strand of meaning, moral means “confident of the rightness of one’s position” as in moral victory, and can become moral support when lent to others. This sense connects with the noun morale, borrowed from French as moral, but respelled with the extra e in C18. In American English, moral can still be used as a noun instead of morale, and morale for morality, according to Webster’s Third (1986), but there’s scant evidence of either in data from CCAE. Rather, moral is firmly connected with morality, and morale with “confidence in one’s position.” Compounds such as morale-booster and morale building put morale into a quasi-attributive role, which could eventually lead to revised spelling for the adjective in “morale support.”"

For example: \n Apply one coat [of paint] only, as more than one encourages flaking. \n More than one sceptical colleague has been admonished. \n  In some examples like the first, more than one effectively means “the second,” so that the choice of singular verb is reinforced by notional agreement.

The word meaningful has three such units or morphemes: \n mean + -ing + -ful \n Morphemes may be roughly divided into the free and the bound, the first being independent units, able to stand without any attachments; whereas the second must be attached to a free morpheme. (So in the case of meaningful, mean is a free morpheme, and the other two are bound.) In English the various prefixes and suffixes are all bound morphemes, and they usually fit the definition just given. Some affixes such as the prefix ex- and the suffix -able do nevertheless seem to be capable of standing alone. Still it can be argued that they have somewhat different meanings when standing as words and when functioning as affixes, and this makes them different morphemes which coincide in form. \n More debatable is the question as to just how free some of the “free” morphemes are, when the basic stem to which suffixes are attached cannot itself stand alone. What about the stem of the word driving? There driv- must be the “free” morpheme, even though it never stands alone in exactly that form.

Though mortgager is more regular in its spelling (see under -ce/-ge), and on record since C17, it seems to have disappeared. The -or ending is no doubt supported by the fact that it’s first and foremost a legal word. See further under -er/-or. \n When arranging the finance for a new home, some buyers are surprised to find that they are the mortgagor and the bank or building society is the mortgagee. The surprise probably has something to do with the idea that the suffix -ee connotes someone who is on the receiving end of an action (as with employee/employer). In fact not all -ee words are passive expressions (see further under -ee). Add to this the obscurity of the verb mortgage itself. Its meaning is still a little elusive, even when one knows that the first syllable is the Latin/French word for “dead” and the second means “pledge.” The Oxford Dictionary (1989) offers its best help in a quotation from a C17 lawyer, who explains that the property involved in a mortgage is a pledge which is “dead” to the provider of the mortgage if the owner repays the loan on time; and “dead” to the owner if he cannot.

Mortice appears in C18, and is preferred in dictionaries of architecture and building, perhaps because of the spelling of other terms such as cornice and lattice. In general British English represented in the BNC, mortise prevails in written references to such things as mortise deadlocks and mortise-and-tenon joints, although mortice is common in the transcribed speech, suggesting that it may be the more intuitive spelling.

(See further under adverbs section 1.) \n The two meanings can be difficult to separate, and mostly could be either in examples like: \n The doctor was mostly concerned that I should have some time off. \n Most is a common intensifier meaning “very,” used in: \n ∗ verb phrases where it modifies a past participle, as in:  \n The doctor was most concerned that I should have time off. ∗ superlative constructions for many adjectives with two or more syllables, such as most vibrant, most beautiful (see adjectives section 2). \n Most also works as shorthand for almost before indefinite determiners (especially any and every) and in indefinite compounds, for example most anyone/ everyone, anything/everything, anywhere/everywhere, and anytime.

Motif was first borrowed into C14 English from French, meaning something like “that which creates a moving impression on the mind.” In less than a century it was being respelled motive, in line with its Latin ancestor, and acquiring new meanings such as “argument” and “whatever spurs someone into action.” In French it remained motif, and acquired the further meaning of “dominant artistic theme,” which came into C19 English as a fresh loanword. Quite soon however, it too could be spelled motive, though this remains the secondary spelling. Note that motif is pluralized simply by the addition of s (motifs). Not having Anglo-Saxon origins, its final letter makes no change from f to v, as in leaf etc. \n The German loanword Leitmotiv (“leading theme”) can also be written in several ways. While Leitmotiv is the standard German form, Leitmotive and Leitmotif also occurred in C19 English, and increasingly the initial capital has been replaced by lower case. In both the UK and the US leitmotif seems now to be the dominant form, ahead of leitmotiv by more than 2:1 in BNC data, and more than 8:1 in CCAE."

		"title": "mottos or mottoes",
		"explanation":"How should the plural of motto be spelled? Mottoes still seems to be preferred by American and British writers, and has a substantial majority in data from both CCAE and the BNC. Yet mottos was endorsed by 85% of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998-2001), including hundreds of British and Americans. This is in line with the worldwide trend for the plurals of borrowed words ending in -o : see -o section 1."

		"title": "mould or mold",
		"explanation":"These alternative spellings apply to three distinct words, for “fungus,” “shape” (as noun and verb), and the rather archaic “earth,” still found in leaf mo(u)ld. The third goes back to Old English mold, which gives the spelling mold the better pedigree by far. Mould dates only from C17. Obscurities in the origins of the first two words have left them taking on the spellings of the third by default. \n Mould is now the standard British spelling for all three words, and it dominates the BNC data with only rare instances of mold for the sense “shape.” But in American English mold is standard, outnumbering mould in CCAE data by more than 12:1. Canadian usage tolerates both mould and mold, though the first is more visible, in the judgement of Canadian Oxford (1998). Australians mostly use mould, like the British (see the Macquarie Dictionary, 1997). \n The spelling of all derivatives of mo(u)ld, including mo(u)ldboard, mo(u)lder, mo(u)ldy, will also depend on which regional tradition you are working with."

		"title": "moult or molt",

		"title": "moustache, mustache or mustachio",
		"explanation":"The standard British spelling is moustache, used overwhelmingly in BNC data. In the US, moustache and mustache divide the field in the ratio of about 1:4, by the evidence of CCAE. Both moustache and mustache reflect the French source word, whereas mustachio is a curious blend of Italian mustaccio and Spanish mostacho. Mustachio (or mustachios – identifying the two parts of a longer m(o)ustache) appears only very rarely as an alternative to the other two in either British or American data. More often it in appears in adjectival form as mustachioed, as in: \n Rows of mustachioed men looked down from their perches along the walls. \n ♦ For the derivation of the adjective mustachioed, see -ed section 2."

Yet mousey is the preferred spelling of more than 75% of citations in data from both BNC and CCAE.

In both American and British English, movable is clearly in the majority, by 3:1 in CCAE data, and 2:1 in data from the BNC. Moveable has its special domain in the field of law, as in moveable assets, yet BNC data show that it’s being harnessed for other ordinary purposes, as in moveable furniture/walls as well as moveable feast. The tendency to reinstate moveable in late C20 British English is visible in other words of this kind: see -eable."

		"title": "mowed or mown",
		"explanation":"Both these serve as past participles for the verb mow. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) gives preference to the older mown, while other dictionaries in the UK and the US make it mowed. The alternatives remind us that the verb mow is still evolving into a regular verb. In Old and Middle English it was irregular, but began to acquire regular parts (mowed for past tense and past participle) in C16, and the transition further advanced in the US. Mown is used for only about 25% of past participles in CCAE data, whereas in the BNC it appears in more than 90% of instances. British writers typically use mown for both new mown grass and for figurative applications, such as mown down by gangsters’ bullets. The American equivalents are freshly mowed grass and worshipers mowed down in a Hebron mosque. As often, American English is readier to endorse the regular patterns of spelling and word formation.

		"title": "Mr(.)",
		"explanation":"This has been used as a courtesy title for decades, replacing the earlier Esq. It lends dignity to the names of ordinary citizens, and in press reporting it is still conventional to preface the names of both famous and unknown men with Mr. For example: \n When both the Minister for Justice, General McEoin, and the Attorney General, Mr. Charles Casey, made it clear that they considered the legislation inopportune . . . \n Mr. Murray now wants to give away the Smugglers’ Kitchen. \n [The] Academy assistant manager promised to look into Mr. Doblin’s case \n Several groups are however exempt from this general practice. The first example above shows how persons with a title of their own do not have it replaced by Mr. Others exempted are those with a claim to fame in the worlds of sport, entertainment or the arts. For them, adding Mr. (and removing the first name) may compromise their identity: witness Mr Woods for Tiger Woods, Mr Cook for Alistair Cook, Mr Hockney for David Hockney. Historical figures are identified without Mr. – as are boys, for whom it would seem inappropriate. Those charged with criminal offences are a further category of exception. Most newspapers refer to them by surname only – except the New York Times. \n Note that Mr. normally appears as Mr in British style, because it’s regarded as a contraction, rather than an abbreviation.

They give stops to both MS. and ms., though this strictly depends on your policy for punctuating abbreviations (see abbreviations section 2). The plural forms are MSS and mss, with or without stops. \n While MS(.) and ms(.) are the forms listed in standard dictionaries, Ms is also occasionally seen for “manuscript.” Whether it represents an accident of typesetting or a decision of the editor is a further question.

		"title": "Muhammad, Mohammed or Mahomet",
		"explanation":"These are the three most widely used spellings for the name of the founder of Islam – though there are others on record which vary the vowels, the use of double or single mand the choice of d or t at the end. The variability of the vowels results from the fact that traditional Arabic script registered only the consonants of a word: and the vowels vary with the different forms of spoken modern Arabic which supplied them. \n The earliest European spelling was Mahomet, used from C16, and this survives in C19 English literature. The form Mohammed gained currency in C17 and C18, and was the primary spelling well into C20. Muhammad is now felt to best represent the Classical Arabic form of the name, and it’s the spelling given priority in Webster’s (1961) and the second edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1989). But database evidence suggests that Muhammad is better established in the US than the UK. Muhammad appears in the majority of instances in CCAE data, whereas in the BNC it makes only about one third of the total. In both databases the frequency of Muhammad is boosted by various references to Muhammad Ali (once Cassius Clay, world heavy-weight boxing champion). The changed spelling of his name is symptomatic of the general change, whether in reference to the prophet or not. But in the transition, Mohammed remains the given name for many prominent Muslims, and continues in the names of historical personages, e.g. Mohammed II, Sultan of Turkey 1145–1181."

		"title": "multi-",
		"explanation":"This prefix meaning “many” is derived from Latin loanwords such as multifarious, multiply, multitude. Since C19 it has helped to create various technical words, including: \n multicellular multilaminate \n multimeter multipartite \n as well as ones which are part of our common vocabulary: \n multicolored multicultural  \n multifaceted multigrade \n multilateral multilingual \n multimillionnaire multinational \n  multiplex multipurpose \n multiracial multistorey \n Further development of the prefix can be seen in compound adjectives, such as multi-handicapped and multi-tasking (abilities), where multi- is an abbreviation of either multiple or the adverb multiply. The hyphen is a useful indicator of this extended meaning. But note that some dictionaries and writers, especially in the UK, are inclined to use hyphens in other words from the list above. There’s little need for a hyphen in any of them, because the stem begins in each case with a consonant. The New Oxford (1998) gives hyphens only to words such as multi-ethnic, where the stem begins with a vowel."

		"title": "multiple punctuation",
		"explanation":"When two punctuation marks coincide at the end of a sentence, do you need both? The general principles are: \n ∗ if the marks are the same, only one is needed \n ∗ if they are different, the stronger or “heavier” one takes precedence \n A question mark thus supersedes a period or stop used to mark the end of a sentence or quotation: \n He asked “Do you want a lift?” \n  What did they mean by “Further information is needed”? \n In each case, the question mark takes over from the final period/stop which might have appeared on the other side of the quote marks. On occasions when the exclamation and question mark coincide, the Chicago Manual (2003) recommends using the mark more appropriate to the (communicative) context, hence the exclamation point in You ask me why am I here! However when two marks of “equal strength” are needed (Ritter, 2002), both punctuation marks may be used (?!). The alternative would be to use an interrobang (see interrobang). \n When multiple punctuation involves an abbreviatory stop, it yields to the period that ends a sentence, but is retained alongside other marks. Compare: \n We need food and drink etc. \n Food and drink etc., are what we need. \n Did you say “food and drink etc.”? \n (See further under quotation marks section 3c.) \n ♦ For multiple punctuation with parentheses, see brackets section 3."

Scholars also recommend Muslim as the best transliteration of the Classical Arabic, hence the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) note that Muslim is “now the preferred form.” But the Dictionary still presents Moslem first, as in its first edition, and Webster’s Third (1986) does likewise. The switchover from Moslem to Muslim is slightly less advanced in the US than the UK, judging by the fact that the two spellings appear in equal numbers in CCAE, whereas the data from BNC are weighted in favor of Muslim, by a factor of 2:1.

		"explanation":"Though in Greek it meant “ten thousand,” this word in English now means an indefinitely large number. Its grammatical status is also somewhat indefinite, and it’s variously used as a noun and as a kind of determiner. \n * as noun, myriad is usually construed in the singular with the indefinite article, as in a myriad of papers, but sometimes with other determiners, as in the myriad of books written about her, and their myriad of products. The plural form myriads is also found, as in myriads of tiny shells, more in British than American English, by the evidence of BNC and CCAE. \n * as determiner, myriad combines with other determiners, as in: \n a myriad pine needles \n the myriad administrative changes \n your myriad younger readers \n its myriad problems \n as well as appearing on its own: \n . . . chased by dolphin and myriad seabirds \n The use of myriad(s) often seems faintly rhetorical – geared to impress with the vast and countless numbers of something. It therefore couples rather strangely with an ordinary finite number, as when De Koonig’s myriad subjects turn out to be no more than those of the 76 paintings exhibited. The suggestion that pregnant women have a myriad choices for exercising sounds more than a little far-fetched, and dilutes the force of the word.

But the borderland between the two adjectives is fuzzy, and mystical claims much of it, as in \n an almost mystical appeal \n his brand of mystical atheism \n Mystical is far commoner than mystic (as adjective) in both American and British English, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC.

Yet either word would work in a sentence such as the following: \n Prometheus was a mythic/mythological king of Greece \n Both mythic and mythical can carry the sense “existing only in myth, fictional,” but this is rather more the domain of mythical, as in:  \n . . . the mythical Welsh seaside town in “Under Milk-Wood” \n In British English, mythical is a good deal more common than mythic (in the ratio 5:2 in BNC data), whereas they appear in almost equal numbers in the American English data of CCAE.

The spellings most in doubt are inflected verbs derived from nouns with two or more syllables, e.g. button, toboggan. Yet by the principles just mentioned, such words can only be spelled with one n, as follows: buttoned hyphened pardoned \n sequined tobogganed turbaned \n Anomalies and exceptions are:  \n* loanwords with variable stress, such as chagrined, which will be irregular for those who stress the second syllable \n * compounds like sin(-)binned, whose second component seems to dictate the spelling of the inflection \n For other sets of words affected by doubling, see doubling of final consonant."

		"title": "naive, naïve, and naïf",
		"explanation":"This French loan comes into English in both masculine and feminine forms: naıf¨ and naıve ¨ . The two are acquiring distinct grammatical roles, in which the French gender distinction is neutralized. So naıve ¨ or rather naive is used for the adjective in reference to both men and women. The accent-free spelling is fostered by the lack of dieresis on many typewriters and wordprocessors; and three quarters of all instances of the word in BNC data were without it. So naive stands as the primary spelling for the adjective in reference dictionaries such as New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000), the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie (1997). Both Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) preferred the accented French spelling. \n Meanwhile the masculine form naif is increasingly used in both British and American English for the noun meaning “an innocent,” again for both women and men. See for example: \n Linda P is a fresh-face naif . . . \n  . . . the rich naif played by Henry Fonda \n Naif still occasionally finds uses as an adjective, in examples which suggest lingering deference to its masculine gender in French. This would explain examples such as Yankovic plays the naif George Newman, as well as naif art (in English usually naive art) and the loanword/compound faux-naif (usually predicative; see under adjectives). But the role of naif as gender-free noun is well recognized in current dictionaries."

There are permutations and combinations of the two variable items in between: forms with or without the dieresis; and with e,´ plain e or y as the last syllable – though all are compromises on linguistic consistency. Surprisingly perhaps, the trend to replace the French e´ with y is stronger in British English than American. In data from the BNC naivety outnumbers naıvet ¨ e´ by almost 4:1, and the latter is absent from New Oxford (1998). This coincides with a note in Merriam-Webster (2000), that naivety is “chiefly British.” The American preference is clearly for naıvet ¨ e´, which outnumbers naivety by more than 100:1 in data from CCAE. Canadians also prefer naıvet ¨ e´, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998), whereas Australians are for naivety, and the French forms are little used by their position in the Macquarie Dictionary (1997) sequence of alternatives. \n The dieresis in naıvety ¨ is steadily disappearing, as from naıve ¨ (see previous entry), and all dictionaries put naivety ahead of naıvety ¨ .

Jim Wright \n a Cairn Terrier named after Fletcher Christian \n whereas American idiom uses named for for this purpose: \n the new gun law, named for James Brady \n the Axel jump was named for its inventor Axel Paulsen \n Usage data show that the divide is not so absolute. Though named after is far more common than named for in BNC data, by about 10:1, the latter is clearly not unknown. Americans make substantial use of both idioms, while favoring named for over named after by about 3:2 in data from CCAE. Canadians prefer named after, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998), as do Australians (Macquarie Dictionary, 1997). \n In all the examples so far, being named after/for involves the proper name of a person. But the data show other kinds of proper names invoked in such naming. Some instances refer you to a placename: \n the Pugwash conference – so named after the site of their first meeting in Nova Scotia. \n Some explain a name by reference to commercial products (named after a bar of soap), or the titles of songs or books (each . . . named for a different book in the bible). Yet other names come from mythical animals or successful race-horses. Beyond all these are names that connect with generic elements, for example: \n Copper Canyon – named for the minerals mined there \n The redstart, named for its strikingly red tail, is mainly a woodland bird. \n These examples, among others from both CCAE and the BNC, show the further reaches of the idiom, indicating other than commemorative reasons for choosing a name."

		"title": "names",
		"explanation":"What’s in a name? Plenty – though our answer to Shakespeare’s question focuses on whether the form of the name is right for the person concerned. Individual family decisions as well as cultural elements are embedded in people’s nomenclature, and both courtesy and diplomacy may be at stake in getting them right. No-one is so aware of the mistreatment of a name as its owner. \n The sections following concentrate on personal names, titles and initials, all of which raise issues of style. The writing of institutional names is discussed under capital letters (sections 1 and 3), and geographical names are examined under their own heading. \n 1 Order of names. In western culture a person’s given name comes first and so is their “first name.” Many Asian and some East European names are ordered the other way, with the family name first and the given name(s) after it. (For specific nationalities, see further under first name or forename.) Asians and others may nevertheless invert the customary order of their names to comply with Anglo-Saxon and West European practice. It will not be obvious with, say, a Japanese name unless you’re familiar with Japanese given names. Note also that Spanish Latin American names normally comprise three units: a given name, the family name (patronymic), and mother’s family name. For men and unmarried children the names appear in that order, though after being introduced they drop the third and use the first two. Spanish women after marrying are known by four names: their given and family names, followed by de and their husband’s two surnames. However once introduced they would be called by their husband’s family name, like married women in the English tradition. \n 2 Titles and names. Most names are preceded by some sort of title. Those for a number of different nationalities are listed under forms of address. Beyond the choice of title there are questions about how it combines with the rest of the name. The title is generally used in full if followed by the surname alone. For example: \n General Monash Professor \n Waterhouse Senator Button \n The title may be abbreviated if followed by initials or a given name: \n Gen. John Monash Prof. E.R. Waterhouse \n Sen. J. Button \n The title Reverend has been subject to different conventions of style. According to the highest Anglican tradition, it must always be followed by initials or a givenname, never just Reverend Marshall. Fowler (1926) likens it to the structure of names titled with (the) Hon. and Sir, which helps to explain the force of tradition behind it in Britain. He does nevertheless allow for Reverend Dr. (or Mr.) Marshall, when the cleric’s name or initial are not known. Gowers (1965) noted lapses in these conventions (“especially in Scotland and Ireland”), and thought that the style Reverend Marshall was on its way to acceptability. This is so in the “lower” Protestant churches, according to The Right Word at the Right Time (1985). Yet in more encompassing data from the BNC, instances of Reverend plus surname make up only about 15% of the total. There are alternative views and practices in the US also. The Chicago Manual of Style (1993) affirms the high Anglican convention; but with other churches there’s no such prescription, as Webster’s English Usage (1989) noted. The variation shows up in CCAE data, in examples of “high” and “low” church styles. Christian names are there in Reverend Martin Luther King, Reverend Jesse Jackson and some less widely known (e.g. Reverend John Pinkerton, Reverend William Borders), but absent from numerous others who are simply Reverend Johns, Reverend McLean, Reverend Morton etc. On rare occasions these are second references to the persons concerned, and abbreviations of the full form given earlier – but mostly not. Rather they suggest that Reverend is being used like other professional titles (Professor, Dr), and put with the surname alone. The transition is restrained by tradition within the Anglican church of Canada (Canadian English Usage, 1997) and Australia (Style Manual, 2002), but accepted within other Protestant denominations. \n ♦ For the abbreviations Rev. and Revd., see under Reverend. \n ♦ For the use of stops in Rev(.), Gen(.) and other abbreviated titles, see abbreviations section 2. \n 3 Initials. The practice of using initials to represent given names has been more common in Europe than in America or Australia. Various celebrated names are rarely given in any other form: C. P. E. Bach, T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis, P. G. Wodehouse. In bibliographies and referencing systems (author–date, Vancouver), the use of initials is well established (see bibliographies). Both the Chicago Manual of Style (2003) and Copy-editing (1992) use stops after each initial, as well as space, as shown in the names above. But in common usage the space between initials is being whittled down (C.P.E. Bach, T.S. Eliot, C.S. Lewis, P.G. Wodehouse), making the spacing exactly like that used in initialisms (see acronyms last section). This was the style endorsed by a majority of respondents (68%) in the Langscape survey 1998–2001. Stops too are often omitted – as in C P E Bach – in lists of names in newspapers, journals and directories. In Britain this is now standard style for correspondence (Todd, 1995), and it‘s endorsed in the Australian government Style Manual (2002). Unpunctuated initials need not keep a space between each letter, and evolve naturally enough into CPE Bach etc. This was endorsed only by a third of respondents to the Langscape survey mentioned before, but it is standard in the Vancouver referencing system (see under bibliographies). Chicago Manual (2003) accepts this style with neither stops nor space when naming public figures such as JFK and FDR, but not more generally. Presidents seem to be special cases, as also Harry S Truman, where the S is unstopped because it doesn’t stand for one particular name. (Truman’s parents wanted the letter to invoke a name belonging to each of his grandfathers: Solomon and Shippe.) The practice of using an initial as well as a given name, as in J. Arthur Rank, Dwight D. Eisenhower is more widespread in the US than the UK. \n ♦ For the convention of addressing a married woman by her husband’s initials, see under forms of address section 1. \n 4 Surnames. Getting a surname exactly right may require checking with Who’s Who, a dictionary of biography, or the telephone directory. There are permutations and variants of most English surnames (e.g. Haywood/Heywood, Matthews/Mathews, Philips/Phillips, White/Whyte), apart from the rather fluid spelling of foreign names on the way to being anglicized. Following the initial capital there may be internal capitals in surnames beginning with Fitzand Mac or Mc (see under those headings). Capitals are also an issue with the particles da, de, van, von etc., which begin numerous Italian, French, Dutch, German and other European names. (See capital letters section 1.) Note also the use of space, and hyphens, in compound surnames such as La Nauze and Lloyd-Jones. \n 5 Roman numerals. Postnominal enumerators such as III, IV, V and the designations Jr. and Sr. have been used in American families to differentiate older and younger bearers of the same name, as with Joseph Kennedy Jnr. and Joseph Kennedy III. The original convention had these designators updated once the first bearer of the name had died, so that JK III then became JK Jr. etc. But the convention stopped with some celebrated figures such as Adlai Stevenson III, whose numeral was never updated. This fixed style has created an alternative custom in some American families, according to the Chicago Manual (1993). The enumerators have never been set off with a comma, and this is now the normal style for Jr., as illustrated above. Note also that Jr. (and Sr.) carry a full stop, like most American abbreviations.

		"title": "narcissus",
		"explanation":"The Narcissus of Greek myth gave his name to the flower, which came into English via Latin. Its plural can be either narcissi, or the English narcissuses, given that many Latin plant names attract English plurals in ordinary usage (see under -us section 1). Yet narcissuses presents a rapid set of ss to be uttered, and though this hardly affects the printed page, it seems to combine with traditional latinity to support narcissi as the preferred plural. Both Oxford (1989) and New Oxford (1998) endorse it as the primary form, and it is indeed the only plural to be found in the BNC. In American data from CCAE, both narcissi and narcissuses occur, in the ratio 3:1 – and the first is given preference in Merriam-Webster (2000). Webster’s Third (1986) prioritized narcissus itself to be used as a zero plural (see under that heading), and both databases provide examples: \n simple to grow scented [plants] include lilies, carnations, narcissus, friesias \n In CCAE the zero plural narcissus is almost as common as narcissi."

		"title": "narrative",
		"explanation":"An ancient form of art and entertainment, narrative comes naturally to most of us when we have something to tell. The habit of recounting things in the order in which they happened, i.e. in chronological order, is what many people resort to in impromptu discussion, when they have to explain such things as how a meeting turned out, or what caused the accident. Making the order of a narrative match the order of happening is the simplest way for the speaker to relate the story, and for the listener to digest it – as long as there’s time for the whole of it. \n In documentary writing, narrative is definitely less satisfactory. Readers usually want to know more than what happened to get a perspective on it, and some insights out of it. The writer’s point of view comes through more clearly if only significant events are told, and this selection would be structured argumentatively rather than chronologically.

The naturalist is primarily a student of nature and its flora and fauna, though the term is also applied to those concerned with naturalism in art, literature or philosophy. A naturist is one who advocates or practises nudism. Naturist is thus what “insiders” would call themselves, whereas outsiders typically use nudist. In the US, nudist is far commoner than naturist – by more than 7:1 in data from CCAE. But in the BNC the ratio is roughly 3:2 – suggesting that more practitioners of naturism get into print in the UK than the US."

		"title": "naught or nought",
		"explanation":"Though both mean “nothing,” these two have slightly different origins: naught is a compound of Old English na (“no”) + wiht (“thing”), and nought of ne (“not”) + owiht (“anything”). In British English the first is a good deal more current than the second, by the evidence of the BNC. Naught mostly survives in phrases such as come to naught, set at naught, all for naught, which have a slightly old-fashioned ring to them. Nought is in fact taking over from naught in some of those phrases, for example: \n peace negotiations came to nought \n not for nought did he train in the jungles of Borneo \n But nought also has a working life as a reference to the number 0 in arithmetic, and elsewhere when numbers are being quoted: \n worth nought out of ten \n If nought is divided by nought, is the answer infinity? \n Even so nought is replaced by zero in some numerical roles (temperatures well below zero), and in its descriptive functions in the domains of finance (zero dividend, zero risk), sport (zero points score) and science (zero concentration, absolute zero). BNC data has zero outnumbering nought by about 4:1 in current British English. (See further under zero.) \n In American English, naught has survived better than nought, by a factor of almost 15:1 in data from CCAE. Most occurrences of naught are in phrases such as all for naught, it wasn’t for naught, went for naught, naught had been lost, which seem to appear in ordinary usage – rather than self-conscious styles of writing. On its few appearances, nought appears in those phrases, but never as a number. This is where Americans prefer zero, and it outnumbers naught/nought in CCAE data by about 350:1. \n Canadians find both naught and nought rather archaic, according to Canadian English Usage (1997), but like Americans, they are more used to the first than the second. Australians, like the British, make some numerical use of nought alongside zero, but very little of naught."

		"title": "nauseating, nauseous and nauseated",
		"explanation":"Older dictionaries held that both nauseating and nauseous meant “causing or engendering nausea,” and nauseated “affected with nausea.” But all current dictionaries allow that nauseous now most commonly means what nauseated has always meant. Its most common collocations in BNC data both written and spoken are feel(ing) nauseous and felt nauseous, and this is now acknowledged as the dominant sense by British and American authorities (Burchfield, 1996, and Webster’s English Usage, 1989). In British data nauseous means “affected with nausea” in about 65% of instances, whereas in American data it’s more than 85%. Older usages such as the nauseous odor of popcorn and the figurative nauseous repetition of the phrase are in the minority. Webster’s English Usage documents the rise of nauseous meaning “nauseated” in post-World War II America, but there’s little to show for it in the UK, and Gowers’s edition of Fowler (1965) has no reference to it. Yet the Oxford Dictionary (1989) has C17 citations of nauseous used to mean “inclined to nausea,” labeled “obsolete” – which perhaps diverted researchers from updating the entry for the second edition. The current use of nauseous may thus be a kind of revival rather than innovation. All this makes nauseous more often a synonym for nauseated than for nauseating, and nauseated becomes the least common of the three words in current English."

Database evidence shows that Navajo is now the preferred spelling of both British and American writers. Navajo outnumbers Navaho by more than 2:1 in BNC data, and by 14:1 in CCAE.

		"title": "-nce/-ncy",
		"explanation":"Words which are identical but for these endings often seem to offer us a choice. Should it be complacence or complacency, compliance or compliancy? Many others raise the same question, although usually one is a good deal more frequent than the other. In the list below, the one in italics is far more common in database evidence. More often than not it’s the word ending in -nce which dominates, but not always. \n brilliance/brilliancy competence/competency \n complacence/complacency compliance/compliancy \n concomitance/concomitancy concurrence/concurrency \n consistence/consistency consonance/consonancy \n convergence/convergency dependence/dependency \n hesitance/hesitancy insistence/insistency \n insurgence/insurgency lenience/leniency \n malignance/malignancy permanence/permanency \n persistence/persistency recalcitrance/recalcitrancy \n  relevance/relevancy \n With ascendance/ascendancy/ascendence/ascendency there are four choices (see further under ascendant). For the choice between dependence/dependency and dependance/dependancy, see dependent or dependant. \n Many of the words listed embody abstractions that are on the margins of common usage, mostly invoked in formal and theoretical writing. One may have an old-fashioned ring to it, as with brilliancy and consistence, while the other brilliance/consistency is the standard word. As those examples show, it’s impossible to predict which of the pair is likely to be the “ordinary” member. \n The lack of clear distinction between the two endings is at least partly due to the fact that the abstract/concrete relationship between them is changing. Historically it was -nce which was the more concrete of the two, because it was the verbal noun, and the verb element can be seen and felt in some like compliance and convergence. However many -nce words were formed in French from verbs which have not come into English. They therefore seem quite as abstract as those ending in -ncy, which represent Latin abstract nouns ending in -ntia, and express the state or quality of a related adjective. \n In contemporary English, the -ncy word is often more specific than the -nce one. This shows up in the contrast between emergence and emergency, or between dependence and dependency (when the latter is used to mean “dependent territory”), and between excellence and (your) excellency. Other -ncy words with quite specific meanings are constituency and vacancy. When both -nce and -ncy words are current, it’s the -ncy one which can become plural, as with competence/competencies, irrelevance/irrelevancies, insurgence/insurgencies. In grammatical terms, the -ncy word is a countable noun, while the -nce one is a mass noun (see further under count nouns). All this shows that the older distinction between the two groups is breaking down and being replaced by a fresh paradigm. We are caught between the two paradigms with the less common pairs."

		"title": "née and né",
		"explanation":"Nee´ is the feminine form of the French word meaning “born.” It was borrowed into C18 English to preface a woman’s maiden name, as in Agatha Christie nee Miller. As in that case, the nee´ links the woman’s married name directly with the other, and her given name is not repeated. The juxtaposition of the two surnames helps those who know her only by one of them. \n The masculine counterpart ne´ made its debut in American English in the 1930s, and is beginning to be seen in Britain. It matches nee´ as a way of juxtaposing a man’s given and family name with an assumed professional name, for example Tab Hunter, ne Arthur ´ Gelien. Its more remarkable function is to indicate the changed name of a place or institution, for example Sri Lanka ne Ceylon. ´ Yet American writers also tend to use nee´ for both these additional functions, as in the following from CCAE: \n Harry Ross (nee Rosenzweig) \n Chevron Corp, nee Standard Oil of California \n . . . taken the lead from the Los Angeles nee´ Oakland Raiders \n the Historical Society of Washington nee the ´ Columbia Historical Society \n The general preference for nee´ rather than ne´ can perhaps be explained by the fact that two letters put it below the common threshold for content words in English (see under words). Three letters are also safer when, as often, the accent cannot be printed (nee). The French genders vested in nee´ and ne´ have evidently faded, as in some other French loanwords e.g. employee, naive, plaintiff. \n ♦ Compare alias and aka."

		"title": "need",
		"explanation":" This verb has three roles in contemporary English: as a main verb, a semi-modal, and a catenative: \n She needs a holiday (main verb) \n She needn’t take it now (quasi-modal) \n She doesn’t need to take it before Christmas (catenative) \n As a main verb in the first sentence, needs takes an s ending for the third person singular present tense, and its own object. In the second sentence need as semi-modal has no s ending, and a bare (to-less) infinitive to extend its meaning. Note also that the negative n’t is attached directly to it – another feature of auxiliaries. The third sentence is a kind of compromise between the first two. Need as catenative takes an infinitive with to (see catenatives). The negative is formed in the normal way for main verbs, i.e. with the help of the verb do and the negative attached to it. \n The use of need as a quasi-modal is probably not as common as it used to be. Nowadays it’s largely confined to negative statements like the one above, or those with negative implications expressed through hardly, only, scarcely etc. Research for the Longman Grammar (1999) shows this usage now mostly in academic writing, and in British – but not American – fiction. The non-modal form with do support prevails in other kinds of discourse, in 90% of instances of need as main (and catenative) verb."

It covers the stereotypical You ain’t seen nothing yet, as well as the lively examples published by Labov (1972): \n Ain’t nobody know about no club. \n We ain’t write over no streets nothing. \n In each case the repetition of the negative by alternative means in close proximity helps to underscore the force and/or defiance of the utterance. Though negative concord is socially stigmatized in both American and British English, it has a long history of use and survives in casual conversation. Double or multiple negation is not censured when it occurs through repetition or reformulation of the negative in independent phrases, as in No, not that one, or at different levels in the grammatical hierarchy: a not unacceptable solution. See further under double negatives."

		"title": "negatives",
		"explanation":"In English, negation may be expressed in several ways: \n ∗ through whole words \n not never (adverbs) \n no (adjective) \n none (pronoun) \n nobody no-one nothing (nouns) \n ∗ through phrases embodying those words, such as not at all under no circumstances by no means \n ∗ through prefixes such as a-, dis-, in-, non-, un-, and the suffix -less (see under each of those headings) \n Negation is also implied in a number of other words, including unless (conjunction), without (preposition), few, little (adjectives/pronouns), and barely, hardly, only, rarely, scarcely, seldom (all adverbs). \n When a negative or quasi-negative adverb is the first word in a sentence or clause, the next item must be an auxiliary, followed by the subject: \n Never would she believe that it was over. \n Hardly had they arrived when the telephone rang. \n Seldom did he speak of his former life. \n This negative inversion also applies to adverbial phrases. See further under inversion. \n 1 Communicating with negatives. A single negative causes few problems. But when two or more are combined in the same sentence or clause it can make difficulties for the reader. This is the real problem with the so-called “double negative,” though not the kind which has been the traditional target of criticism. (See further under double negatives.) When formulating questions, even single negatives can complicate things unnecessarily and make it hard for anyone to know how to reply: \n Were you not driving in excess of 140 kilometers per hour? \n Are you an unlicensed driver? \n If you wanted to say (in answer to either question) that your behavior was perfectly legal, you would have to use two or three negatives: \n No, I was not . . . \n No, I am not unlicensed . . . \n Removing the negative element from the original question helps to guarantee a more reliable answer. \n 2 The scope of negatives. A negative word has considerable reach both within its own clause and beyond it. When attached to a verb which expresses a mental process, it immediately affects the clause depending on it. In fact it’s more idiomatic to say I don’t think he speaks well than I think he doesn’t speak well. Note also the way in which a negative can dominate a whole sentence and forge a cohesive link with the next sentence: \n We didn’t laugh because he fell into the water. The whole ceremony was so ridiculous that we were bursting at the seams . . . \n The scope of such a negative could be limited by a strategically placed comma. With it, the meaning of the sentence changes dramatically: \n We didn’t laugh, because he fell into the water. He might have been crushed against the wharf . . .  \n The extent of the negative is also the basis of choosing between nor and or later in a sentence. See under nor. "

		"title": "negligible or negligent",
		"explanation":"Both these adjectives have a lot to do with putting things out of one’s mind. Negligible is the one to apply to things which are so small that they can be discounted: a negligible amount of makeup on her face. Negligent is applied to the conduct of people who do not attend to things in the usual or proper way. The word embodies more or less criticism, depending on whether the word expresses legal sanctions or not. In negligent driving its censure is much heavier than in a negligent attitude to the garden. In general usage negligent sometimes seems to connote something as light as nonchalance – as if some forms of negligence are negligible. So if neglect and failure to attend to things are really the issue, you may need to use neglectful rather than negligent. \n The word neglig ´ ee´ (the slightest form of dress known to man or woman) embodies the same stem as negligible and negligent.

The struggle for emancipation goes on in the struggle for equality, whatever the differences between the American “Negroes” of the 1930s and 40s, and Afro-Americans in the 1990s, as one citation from CCAE has it. Negro remains the “outsider” term, and all the more so with the affirmation of Black in the last few decades (see under black or Black). This explains the discomfort of a speaker reported in CCAE: \n “The mayor . . . went on preaching . . . about what was good for Negroes. (He didn’t say Negroes. He said blacks, but I don’t like the word blacks, never did. You can call me old-fashioned if you like.)” \n The political and social implications of using the word Negro have still to be reckoned with. In database evidence Negro is usually capitalized in reference to a person, though this adds little by way of respect (see under capital letters section 1). But more generic uses e.g. negro spiritual, negro slaves can appear in lower case. \n The plural of Negro/negro is almost always Negroes/negroes, in keeping with its being an older loanword whose usage is tied to the past rather than the present.

		"title": "neither",
		"explanation":"This word plays several parts in English: \n * pronoun, as in Neither of the two is perfect \n * determiner, as in Neither player could serve reliably \n * conjunct, as in They couldn’t speak. Neither could I \n * conjunction, as in They didn’t apologize, neither did they offer help \n Neither raises questions of agreement, both as a pronoun, and when as a correlative conjunction it serves to create a compound subject for the clause. These, and the correlation of neither with both nor and or, are discussed below. The inversion of subject and verb following neither as conjunct (illustrated above) is discussed under inversion. \n  As a pronoun, neither is often the focus of grammatical comment. When translated as “not either” it sounds like a singular pronoun and seems to require a singular verb – as it has in the example above. This is the only correct form, according to some usage commentators; yet the Oxford Dictionary (1989) demonstrates the acceptability of plural agreement with a set of citations from C17 on. Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000) draw attention to the fact that it often happens after a “periphrastic genitive” (with the preposition of ), as in the following: \n Neither of the movies are what you’d call exciting. \n The plural verb is hardly surprising, seeing that neither can very well mean “not this one, nor that one” in such a context, and the sentence effectively reports on two items at once. It can therefore be justified as notional agreement – or as proximity agreement following “movies.” (See agreement sections 1, 4 and 5.) Plural agreement after neither of is strongly associated with spoken discourse. In BNC it’s used in 75% of all instances from transcribed speech, but only about 20% of instances from written texts. \n 2 Neither with nor. Questions of agreement also come up when neither is paired up with nor as a correlative conjunction. Again the traditional view was that the following verb should be singular, and yet research for the Longman Grammar (1999) shows that the use of a plural verb is quite common. In fact singular and plural agreement have slightly different effects. Compare: \n Neither director nor producer has much experience. \n Neither director nor producer have much experience. \n The singular verb seems to particularize while the plural one generalizes. The use of a plural verb there is as natural as it would be in a matching positive statement: Both director and producer have plenty of experience. \n The plural verb is sometimes used as the way out of another dilemma with neither–nor constructions: what to do when the items paired are different grammatical persons, as in: \n Neither John nor I . . . ready to leave \n Some would argue that the verb should agree with the nearest person (in this case I), and so it should be am. Others would feel that here again the plural are seems quite natural. Or could it be is? (See further under agreement section 4.) Note that with any verb other than be, the alternatives are reduced to two, and so rewording the sentence reduces the problem. \n 3 Neither with or. In formal writing, neither always combines with nor (not or) in coordinated subjects like the ones in the sentences above. But in more informal discourse, neither X or Y is used, and thanks to the Oxford citation record, has been captured in print since C16. In contemporary English data from the BNC, there are about 100 examples from both written and spoken sources: \n . . . can bring about neither equity or development \n Neither Ari or Nathan had seen a place like it. \n  . . . neither exclusively tough or exclusively tender \n Merriam-Webster (2000) notes that neither followed by or is “neither archaic nor wrong,” but that nor is more usual. This certainly holds true by their relative frequencies in the BNC, where instances of neither– nor outnumber those of neither–or by more than 20:1. Yet neither–or is a legitimate construction. It actually extends the negative scope of neither over both or all the alternatives mentioned. See for example: \n Neither the French, the Austrian or the Prussian embassies were willing . . . \n The movie contrives neither to inform, excite, entertain, titillate or engage the eye . . . \n Provided the alternatives match each other syntactically, the negative parallelism of neither–nor is still achieved with neither–or, and it underscores the set rather than its members. The neither–or construction is likely to become more rather than less frequent, given the general decline in the use of nor. See further under nor. \n 4 Neither with more than two alternatives. This has just been illustrated by-the-by with neither–or, and constructions with three or more alternatives strike at the heart of another prescription attached to neither: that it meant “not either one [of two],” and should therefore always introduce a pair of items. The great majority of examples from the BNC and CCAE do consist of two, yet there are others in which neither spells out three alternatives, as in: \n I was neither Jew nor English nor white. \n Neither pianist, nor orchestra nor dancers indulge in virtuoso passages . . . \n . . . neither the police, the Army, nor the ranchers are venturing out . . . \n Neither Chrysler, Ford, nor General Motors adapted quickly. \n While the negative force of neither is at its strongest with two alternatives, there’s no doubt that it can introduce a larger set.

The best known exception is busyness (from busy), where the y must remain so as to distinguish the word from business. \n Because abstract nouns are so readily formed with -ness, there are numerous doublets with abstracts borrowed or made according to French or Latin patterns, ending in -cy, -ion and -ty: \n  abstractness/abstraction \n  accurateness/accuracy \n  acuteness/acuity \n capaciousness/capacity \n conciseness/concision \n  considerateness/consideration \n  crudeness/crudity \n enormousness/enormity \n falseness/falsity \n ingenuousness/ingenuity \n notoriousness/notoriety \n preciseness/precision \n sensitiveness/sensitivity \n tenseness/tension \n turgidness/turgidity \n vacuousness/vacuity \n The words formed with -ness always have a strong link with the adjective, whereas the other member of the pair has usually developed additional meanings. It means that there’s room for both, though there may also be some overlap between them. See further at acuity, conciseness, enormity and ingenuous."

		"title": "net or nett",
		"explanation":"The French adjective net (“neat,” “clean”) was borrowed with that meaning into C14 English. The accountancy meaning “not subject to further deductions” had been added to net by C16, as well as the alternative spellings nett and nette, the feminine counterpart to masculine net in French. The longer spellings were perhaps thought necessary to distinguish the adjective from the Old English noun net, meaning “any thing made with interstitial vacuities,” as Dr. Johnson (1755) so unforgettably put it. The simple spelling net has nevertheless won out for the adjective, and there’s no mistaking it because of the collocations that it regularly appears in: net assets, net income, net loss, net profit, net sum – all connecting it with the balance sheet. The image lends itself to metaphor, as in net immigration or the net effect in terms of the streetscape. \n Dictionaries all give priority to the spelling net, though the earlier nett remains a recognized alternative in British English. In BNC data, nett is quite rare, occurring scarcely 1 in 100 times by comparison with net, and mostly in transcriptions of speech rather than edited prose. It has no role at all in American English, by the evidence of CCAE."

		"title": "Netherlands",
		"explanation":"The Netherlands is the official name for what the English have long known as Holland. It means literally “low(-lying) lands,” and much of the land was and is below sea level, continually threatened by flood tides until a protective wall of dikes was completed in the 1970s. \n In earlier usage, the term Netherlands referred not only to Holland, but also to Belgium and Luxemburg. The British translated it as Low Countries, and have used that phrase to group the three countries together since C16. But Belgium claimed its independence in 1830, and Luxemburg did the same in 1890, so the name The Netherlands was left as the official name for Holland alone. (See further at Holland.) A fresh term Benelux was coined in 1948 to refer to the three countries as a customs union, and this name is the one now used for the three as a unit within the European Union. \n In English-speaking countries both Netherlands and Holland continue to be used, with the balance tipping in favor of the Netherlands in both British and American English, by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE. The definite article was once part of the official title, and capitalized in mid-sentence, as it still sometimes is: \n  . . . the national anthems of The Netherlands and Britain sounded through the theatre \n But the convention was also challenged by the editorial practice of lower-casing the in titles that occur in mid-sentence (see the section 4). The extra capital letter is given to The Netherlands in only about one third of instances in the BNC, and rarely in CCAE. The article itself is sometimes omitted in the interests of streamlined syntax, as in a Netherlands-based company."

The double-barreled Aotearoa New Zealand is used in government correspondence and in the media for the first reference, but it can be abbreviated to New Zealand or Aotearoa for second and subsequent reference, depending on the context, according to the New Zealand government Style Manual (1997)."

		"title": "New Zealand English",
		"explanation":"Two kinds of English have contributed to New Zealand English. One is Scottish English, which can still be heard in the Southland of the South Island, where Scots settled in numbers during C19. Many other settlers came from Australia, hence the underlying similarities between Australian and New Zealand English. The two share numerous colloquialisms and other words that set both apart from British and other varieties. Occasionally the New Zealand record predates the Australian on particular words – allowing the question as to which side of the Tasman Sea they originated on, although reverse immigration from New Zealand to Australia gathered steam only in the latter decades of C20. There’s no question of the many distinctive New Zealandisms coined since settlement, such as section (“block of land”), bach (“a small weekend house”), aerial topdressing (“cropdusting”). Maori loanwords naturally make up the largest group of local terms, for trees and shrubs such as kauri and kowhai, birds such as kiwi and kakapo, and animals such as the dangerous katipo spider. \n With a smaller and more homogeneous population than Australia, New Zealand’s usage norms have remained more like those of British English. This is not unrelated to the fact that its language references have until recently been imported. The earliest New Zealand dictionaries, Orsman’s Heinemann New Zealand Dictionary (1979, 1989) and Burchfield’s New Zealand Pocket Oxford Dictionary (1986) were based on wordlists provided by the European publisher. With the second edition of the New Zealand Pocket (1997) and the large Dictionary of New Zealand English (comprising New Zealandisms alone), the elements of the New Zealand variety are much more fully codified. \n New Zealand English grammar distinguishes itself from British and American in terms of relative frequencies rather than absolute differences. In the details described in Hundt’s research study New Zealand English Grammar (1998), it’s usually closer to British than American, and hardly distinguishable from Australian. The national editorial style is outlined in Write Edit Print: Style Manual for Aoteoroa New Zealand (1997), based on the Australian government Style Manual, but with input from the Maori Language Commission on acceptable printed forms for Maori words."

		"title": "newspapers and news reporting",
		"explanation":"No generalization about newspapers could capture the wide range of writing in them. Their prose styles range from the clich´ed to the creative, and from authoritative to sensation-seeking to cosy intimacy. The style can be commonplace and pedestrian in work-a-day news reporting, or stimulating and original in house editorials, reviews and opinion columns. The signed articles of well-known writers and journalists from Clive James to William Safire are analogues of the C19 literary essay. The wholesale critics of newspaper writing tend to generalize on the basis of the less creditable journalism of low-brow “tabloids.” Yet the broadsheet newspaper doesn’t guarantee you sophisticated journalism, and the more convenient tabloid format is also used by “quality” newspapers in many English-speaking countries, especially for their overseas editions. \n The sheer variety of writing that appears in newspapers is one reason for their great value in language research. Journalistic innovations that persist are read by very large numbers of people and evolve rapidly into accepted idiom. This is why language databases such as the British National Corpus (BNC) and the Cambridge International Corpus (CCAE) contain substantial quantities of news reporting and other journalism, as a way of capturing neologisms and new idioms. \n ♦ For aspects of news language, see further under cliches´ , headline language and journalism."

		"title": "next or this",
		"explanation":"The word next sometimes raises doubts when it refers to dates in the future, as in next Friday or next weekend. In principle it means “nearest in time.” But many people draw a distinction between next and this, using this to mean “during the current week” and next “in the week which has yet to begin.” So on Thursday the “next weekend” would be the one in ten days time, and “this weekend” would be the one only two days away. Like the distinction between this and that, this is closer to the speaker/writer’s standpoint, and next is further away. \n The time distinction between next and this is drawn by northerners rather than southerners in Britain, according to Burchfield (1996). Yet the much greater frequency of this weekend over next weekend in BNC data (of the order of 4:1) suggests that plenty of writers prefer the first for immediate time reference, and are not using next weekend for any future reference. The ratio between the two expressions is much the same for American users, by the evidence of CCAE. A survey of more than 550 Australians conducted in 1995–6 by Australian Style found generational differences: that older Australians (45+) were much less inclined to make the distinction than younger ones, and would simply use next weekend (on a Thursday) for the weekend immediately following. (Dare one suggest that younger people plan further ahead?) Whatever one’s age, the only safe course is to make a point of giving the actual dates of any arrangement involving the word next. This is the advice of Canadian English Usage (1997), where both systems are in use, as in Australia, Britain and the United States."

This correlates with the mixed recommendations of dictionaries: nexuses is given priority in Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998), where nexus is preferred by New Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie (1997).

		"title": "nice",
		"explanation":"The battle to defend the precise meaning of this word was lost some time ago, perhaps in Jane Austen’s time when one of her characters in Northanger Abbey exclaims that nice “is a very nice word indeed! It does for everything.” It is of course a commonplace of conversation, a word expressing favorable judgement without putting too fine a point on it. This strikes at the heart of those who would wish to conserve the use of nice to mean “fine, discriminating” – which can still be done in phrases such as a nice distinction or nice judgement. But the finer meaning hangs on the collocation, rather than the word itself. In data from the BNC nice is only rarely used in the sense “fine, discriminating.” Even in written texts, the commonplace meaning is exploited in the vast majority of citations: \n a multitude of nice misguided types who seek to . . . . . . nice letters praising Steff \n It would be nice if there were pressure groups \n Nice thus serves the interim needs of the writer who wants to be tactful and put a positive spin on the statement. Equally it’s unsuitable for serious prose analysis. \n Writers who use nice to mean “fine, discriminating” are very much in the minority in BNC data. Examples such as a nice matter of judgement, F’s nice example, nice verbalism demonstrate their intent, evident in perhaps 15% of instances overall, at a conservative estimate. Yet the examples are often faintly ambivalent, the further their wording is from the regular collocations. Nice has a long history of shifting its ground. From its origins in Latin as nescius meaning “not knowing, unaware,” it has evolved in English to mean almost the opposite in “discriminating,” and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) documents a trail of obsolete meanings in between. The word seems to resist being pinned down for too long."

		"title": "nickel or nickle",
		"explanation":"In North America, the nickel has always been small change, hence the rather dismissive phrase nickel-and-dime meaning “involving only small amounts of money” and hence “petty, trivial.” It takes on verbal form in nickel-and-diming (with or without hyphens), which is used literally to mean “put under cumulative financial stress through small expenses,” and more figuratively as “wear down or defeat through small incursions.” The verb appears both as nickeled-and-dimed and nickel-and-dimed: \n The regulatory unit has been nickeled and dimed to death already. \n Montana nickel-and-dimed his way through the defense. \n Idioms like these move the word away from its metallic base in nickel, and would explain why nickle may seem just as good a spelling. It is a recognized alternative in both Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000), though supported by relatively few examples in CCAE, only about 1 in 300. \n The metal itself was inauspicously named by German miners: it was Kupfernickel (“copper devil”), because it looked deceptively like copper. It is the major ingredient in what the English call “German silver,” but Germans return the compliment by calling it “English silver.” (See further under throwaway terms.) \n When used as a verb (“apply nickel plating to”) nickel behaves like any other ad hoc verb ending in l – tending to double the l (as nickelled) in British spelling, but not in American, where it remains nickeled.

		"title": "No(.)/no(.)",
		"explanation":"For Americans, this abbreviation for Italian numero (“number”) needs a stop (No.), just like any other (see abbreviations section 2a). For British writers it’s strictly speaking a contraction, which would not normally carry a stop in British style (see contractions section 1). Yet the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors (1981) presents it as No. – perhaps to avoid confusion with the common word No/no (see previous entry). In practice this is unlikely because the abbreviation is regularly followed by a number (No 1), and its distinctive function is clear in context. British writers are in fact divided on the issue, and No. and No share the field almost equally in data from the BNC, whether it’s Symphony No.1 or the No 1 seed in tennis. When No(.) needs a plural, the British scene is again divided, though Nos is rather more popular than Nos., judging from the number of BNC texts in which it appears. Neither is ideal (see abbreviations section 2). American writers just write Nos., as in Lexington Avenue Nos. 5 and 6. \n Singular forms rarely appear in lower case, in either American or British data.

None is variable, and may take either singular or plural. Compare: \n None of the mixture is left. \n None of the ingredients are expensive. \n  The plural verb in the second example shows the not untypical proximity agreement when the of-phrase finishes with a plural noun. (See further under agreement sections 3 and 5.) In BNC data the plural occurred in about 1 in 3 examples following a plural noun. Pundits of the past argued against the latter, apart from Fowler (1926), who commented that it was a mistake to suppose that none “must at all costs be followed by a singular verb.” The Oxford Dictionary (1989) also notes that none as the plural of no one is commonly found with a plural verb. \n The setting of no one has been much debated. The original Oxford Dictionary had it as two words, arguing that it was somehow analogous to every one. Fowler found it more like everyone, but because noone was liable to be misread, preferred no-one as “the right compromise.” Gowers (1965) reversed Fowler’s recommendation, saying that no one “has more backing than no-one, and is recommended.” These contrasting views are still reflected in the mix of practices shown in the BNC. Overall there are a good many more instances of no-one, which outnumbers no one by about 3:2; yet there are rather more writers using no one. In American English data from CCAE, no one is commoner by far, and the only form registered in Webster’s Third (1986). \n In the choice between no-one and nobody, the data show that both Americans and the British prefer the first (by about 3:2).

		"title": "nominal",
		"explanation":"In grammar nominal means “relating to the noun,” and so nominal phrase is an alternative name for the noun phrase (see further under that heading). A nominal style is one which relies heavily on nouns, especially abstract ones, and invests relatively little meaning in its verbs. The verbs are typically copular – the verb be or others which string the noun phrases together, but do not lend any dynamic to the message. (See further under verbs.) \n The nominal style creates sentences like the following: \n Recent expansion of the company’s offices in all major cities requires the installation of new communication systems . . . \n Amid the dull sequence of nouns, verbs are conspicuous by their absence, and the only one used (requires) is itself rather abstract. Compare a verbal style version of the same sentence: \n  The company has recently expanded its offices in all major cities, which means we must install new communication systems . . . \n The verbal style style relies less on nouns generally, and replaces some of the abstract nouns with equivalent verbs. It is usually less impersonal and makes livelier reading. \n To turn verbs (such as expand, install) into abstract nouns (expansion, installation) is to nominalize them. Nominalizations have their place in official and theoretical prose (see abstract nouns). But they are also addictive, being easy to construct into passable phrases and sentences. This is why they are the staple of institutional writing, despite being the reverse of reader-friendly if used continuously. To kick the nominal habit – play down the nouns and make more of verbs – demands more versatility, and sharper thinking. It forces writers to identify a suitable subject for every verb, as well as its tense, aspect and modality. The reward is being better read."

		"title": "nominative",
		"explanation":"This is the grammatical name for the case of the subject of a clause. It was important in the grammar of ancient languages such as Greek and Latin, as well as Old Norse and Old English, where nouns acting as subjects had a distinctive form. In modern languages such as German, and in Aboriginal languages, the term nominative is used for the same reason. But in modern English the nouns are the same whether subject or object of the clause: there’s no external marking to show the nominative as opposed to the accusative case. This is why the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) prefers the terms “subjective” and “objective,” stressing function rather than the form of the word. Yet most English pronouns do have different forms for subject and object (I, me; we, us; who, whom etc.) and the traditional term nominative is used for them in the Longman Grammar (1999).

		"title": "non-",
		"explanation":"Since C19 non- has become the most freely used negative prefix in English. Originally and for centuries it was used in law, in formations like non-parole, but it’s now firmly embedded in everyday English. It is pressed into service in nonce words, apart from being the formative element in many established words. Dictionaries list only a quota of them. \n  Examples from the start of the alphabet show how often non- creates new adjectives and nouns from the existing word stock: \n nonactive nonarrival \n nonbeliever nonclassifiable \n noncriminal non-English-speaking \n nonexistent nonfiction \n Many non- words come into being to show recognition of a problem, and raise hopes of a solution: \n nondutiable nonnuclear nonsexist nontoxic \n Advertisers find them useful for highlighting the virtues of their product, witness nonskid tyres, nonslip soles, nonstop entertainment. Examples like these gain verbal force from the fact that the word with which non- combines (skid, slip, stop) could be a verb rather than a noun. \n 1 Should non- words be hyphenated? Dictionaries agree on one point: that non-words formed with a proper name, e.g. non-European must have a hyphen, in keeping with a general rule of editing (see hyphens section 1c). For the rest there’s no consensus. The New Oxford (1998) and Canadian Oxford (1998) give hyphens to all, whereas Merriam-Webster (2000) sets them all solid, in keeping with the Oxford/Webster divergence on hyphens generally. The Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) exercises its discretion, streamlining the hyphen from many non- words, and keeping it in those which might otherwise challenge the reader. Writers can take their cue from a particular dictionary (as far as it goes), or decide for themselves how essential the hyphen is to decoding the word in its context. If nonmatching socks are mentioned in the context of pairing them up, the word’s meaning is probably clear and not likely to be misconstrued without a hyphen. The fact that nonmatching has not been used before, or if so, never recorded in dictionaries, is neither here nor there. \n 2 Non- and other negative prefixes. Words prefixed with non- are particularly useful for drawing attention to the word they’re coupled with, and expressing its exact opposite. No doubt this is why new words are created with non- alongside older negative words, especially those whose meanings have diverged from being a strict opposite of the base word. This is the raison d’ˆetre for nonappearance and disappearance, for nonedible and inedible, for nonproductive and unproductive. The difference is perhaps clearest when we compare non-American with un-American or non-Christian with un-Christian. The words with non- simply denote the fact that something/someone has no connection with the US or with Christianity. The words with un- have a range of emotional connotations, suggesting alien values, loyalties, cultural and ethical practices from which “true” Americans/Christians would distance themselves. History has shown how dangerous such words can be, with the persecution of supposedly un-American activities by McCarthyist forces in the US in the 1950s. Words with non- are normally more neutral and specific – more literal in meaning than their counterparts with the other negative prefixes."

		"title": "nonfinite clause",
		"explanation":"This term has been used by modern English grammarians for the various structures which express the same kind of information as a subordinate clause, but do not have all its regular components. Compare: \n  He asked if he could come to the meeting. \n with \n He asked to come to the meeting. \n The second sentence is very similar in meaning. The point of the if- clause is expressed through a nonfinite clause (in roman), with a nonfinite form of the verb (in this case, the infinitive). Other types of nonfinite clause work with participles, either the present with -ing or the past with -ed/-en etc.: \n Leaving early we miss out on the drinks. \n The new recruits, bored by the formalities, had stopped listening. \n Note that nonfinite clauses do not usually have their own subject, but borrow it from the adjacent main clause. The rather uncommon cases in which they do express their subject are those where the subject of the nonfinite clause differs from that of the main clause, as in infinitive clauses with for: \n His intention was for you to be there. \n And also in certain past participle clauses: \n That settled they became good friends. \n Nonfinite clauses work as alternatives to all kinds of subordinate clauses, noun, adjectival/relative and adverbial. Stylistically they make for compactness of expression."

		"title": "nonsexist language",
		"explanation":"The feminist movement has undoubtedly succeeded in making people more aware of how sexism can be built into language. Most people now think twice before talking about manning the switchboard or mastering the computer; and reflect on the implications of saying that someone is bitching about their colleagues or that the boss is an old woman. Expressions like those, which could suggest that it takes men to do the job properly, and that negative human behavior is associated with women, are unsympathetic to half the human race. The users of such expressions may have nothing against women, yet the terms in which they project their ideas suggest stereotypes which either make women invisible, or at worst seem to trivialize and denigrate them. The use of sexist language by men or women helps to preserve its negative stereotypes, and social values which disadvantage women generally – just as cigarette smoking creates an atmosphere that endangers even nonsmokers. Specific issues include: \n * generic use of the pronoun he when the reference is to both men and women (see under he and/or she) \n * exclusive-sounding man compounds and idioms. For alternatives, see under man. \n * gratuitous use of female suffixes, especially -ess (see -ess). These can be avoided. \n * letter writing with Sir as the standard salutation. Nonsexist salutations and modes of address are presented under forms of address section 2. \n Solutions to the problems of nonsexist language sometimes look like attempts to even the score, as when frontwoman is invented to replace frontman. Yet frontwoman is no less sexist than frontman. It may serve the purpose in a given context, but is not a general substitute. At that point an inclusive substitute is needed, and some compounds using -person are now quite well established. (See -person.) \n Better still are terms that emphasize the role or job rather than the gender of the person in it, such as frontliner. Gender-free terms alleviate the problems of both sexism and any latent homophobia that may work to the disadvantage of those who would like to do the job. See also spouse."

		"title": "nonstandard",
		"explanation":"Nonstandard is sometimes used as a label in dictionaries and language references as a way of marginalizing words, idioms and spellings of which the authors don’t approve. The label begs the question as to what is standard, and seems to imply a uniform measure of what is appropriate. It could mean that the nonstandard form is not used in writing, but this is not usually said. It could mean that in statistical terms it’s a minority usage, but frequency information is not usually provided. Rather, the term often seems to involve some “ideology of the standard” (Milroy and Milroy, 1985), which is uncomfortable with variation in language. It seeks to identify a single standard form wherever alternatives present themselves. Newer forms are typically excluded, and the standard is thus liable to become tied to a particular time and style of language. Regional and dialectal variants are downplayed or disregarded. The terms standard and nonstandard need constant scrutiny, to ensure that they do not shortcircuit the recognition and consideration of alternative forms of expression.

		"explanation":"The use of nor is probably declining, even in its core domain of coordinating two negative phrases. Compare: The gallery will not be open on Sundays or public holidays. \n The gallery will not be open on Sundays nor public holidays. \n Both sentences are perfectly acceptable English, but the first shows that nor is not really needed to extend the negation over to “public holidays.” Rather it may seem to overdo the expression of the negative for the purposes of a simple announcement. This use of nor for the second coordinate underscores the parallelism of the two phrases, and in the context of fine writing, with more extended coordinates, it would have its place. For example: \n The word universal is never the name of anything in nature, nor of any idea or phantasm found in the mind . . . \n Substitute or for nor in that sentence, and the structure and meaning are still perfectly viable. The negative scope of “never” carries over to the second coordinate (see further under negatives). But the use of nor helps to reaffirm the negative after a complex phrase, and to lift the latter part of the sentence. \n Nor is still most commonly used as a correlative with neither, though even there, or is occasionally found (see neither). It creates negative coordination with other negatives including no, not (and n’t), never, nothing, nowhere, as well as words with negative prefixes such as un-: \n He was unable to say why this was necessary, nor why the stamp read “Do Not Bend.” \n It would be equally possible to use or in that sentence. The only situation in which nor and only nor will do is when the second coordinate is a main clause with its own subject and verb.

In terms of word structure it’s more regular: there are many similar nouns ending in -ity made out of adjectives ending in l, whereas there are none like normalcy. (The nearest analogue is colonelcy, based on a noun ending in l.) On both counts then normalcy is an unusual word, and perhaps that was why President Harding used it in a famous speech of 1920. Unfortunately his use of it drew censorious comments from across the Atlantic, which still echo in the Chambers Dictionary (1988) comment: an “ill-formed word.” But the Oxford Dictionary (1989) has citations both before and after Harding, from both UK and US sources. Normalcy is not however very popular with British writers represented in the BNC, and it makes up less than 1 in 20 instances of the noun. In American data from CCAE, normalcy and normality appears in the ratio 1:2 – so it’s still not the majority usage but a well-established alternative."

		"title": "north, northern and northerly",
		"explanation":" The geographical differences between these are standard throughout the English-speaking world. North and northern locate places relatively closer to the North Pole, while northerly implies an orientation toward the north (as in the northerly aspect of the house) or, paradoxically, direction from the north (as in a northerly breeze). Yet while northerly wind carries the chill factor in Manchester and Michigan, it brings extreme heat in Melbourne. So north and other compass directions are always relative to the writer’s point of reference, and should be counted among the deictic words of the language (see under deixis). Like other compass points, north has its political implications, as in the North–South Center in Miami, which draws a line between continental North America and the Caribbean Nations. What for Australians is sometimes called the “Near North” is to Britons the “Far East.” \n In both British and American English, north/northern also have linguistic connotations. Northern dialects are frequently contrasted with the implicit southern standard in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Just where the boundary lies depends on which vowels and common terms are used as touchstones, but it seems to lie on the southern side of the Central Midlands (Wales, 2000). With speech that neutralizes the distinction between “foot” and “strut” go the stereotypes of working-class England and Scotland, perpetuated in parts of the media despite radical changes in the industrial scene. But the BBC’s use of announcers with a variety of accents is helping to break down the assumption that only a southern voice can be cultivated. \n In the US, linguistic stereotypes work the opposite way, so that northern accents carry prestige and the southern accent is routinely devalued. Again the borderland is fuzzy and depends on whether you use accent or dialect words as the criteria. Carver’s “word geography” (1987) puts it further south (along the Ohio River) than Labov (1991), whose analysis of American vowels reaffirmed a “midland” dialect separating northern and southern speech, and pushed the northern back up into central Illinois and Indiana. Preston’s work on “perceptual dialectology” (1996) showed that the stereotypical judgements of good and bad speech are tempered by living on one side of the notional boundary or the other. But those from the Indiana borderland tend to distance themselves from the southern dialect, and seem to take the negative stereotypes about it for granted."

		"title": "not and n't",
		"explanation":"Negation can be expressed in several ways in English, but the lion’s share is borne by not and its contracted form n’t. In nonfiction writing not/n’t is used twice as often as other negatives such as no, nothing, never, and in conversation about eight times as often, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). Why should this be? It probably reflects the fact (a) that not/n’t attaches itself to verbs, and (b) that verbs referring to mental processes (think, like, expect, remember, want etc.) are common in both positive and negative forms in conversation. \n Not/n’t also attaches itself readily to auxiliary and modal verbs, as in don’t (do not) and won’t (will not). In such cases the negative is more often contracted than the verb; so I don’t is a good deal more frequent than I’d not, and I won’t than I’ll not etc. A general rise in American use of n’t was found by Krug (1994) in news reporting, which Hundt (1998) confirmed in the particular case of the verb have. The verb be tends the opposite way, and it’s not and we/you/they’re not are far more common than it isn’t, we aren’t etc. in speech and everyday writing, according to the Longman Grammar. But verb contraction with not is strongly associated with personal pronouns in declarative sentences, while n’t goes with noun subjects and with question openers. Compare: \n The dog isn’t coming. It’s not coming. \n Isn’t the dog coming? Isn’t it hot today? \n Grammar aside, there are local divergences in the use of not/n’t. The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) notes that speakers from Scotland and northern England tend to use not forms with contracted auxiliaries (I’ll not, he’d not etc). Hundt reports surprisingly high levels of not alongside n’t in New Zealand newspapers, attributable perhaps to the sizable Scottish element in the population – or else their conversational style. \n The contracted negative n’t still tends to be edited out of academic prose, although it is found increasingly in general prose such as news writing. Newspapers of the 1990s in Westergren-Axelsson’s (Uppsala) Press Corpus – both quality and popular press – made much more use of n’t (in don’t and won’t) as well as it’s and that’s in nonquoted material than their counterparts from the 1960s. The contracted negative is there in many kinds of prose in the BNC, though its overall representation in written material is still much lower than in spoken data: 0.2 per million words compared with 1.2 per million words. (See further under contractions section 2.) \n Ambiguous uses of not. Depending on its position in the sentence, not may create ambiguity. For example: All men are certainly not equal. \n Does this mean that “all men are unequal,” or that “not all men are equal?” The question turns on which part of the sentence is covered by the negative –or what its scope is. (See further under negatives.) \n When not or its abbreviation n’t is used in a question, there may be no negation in it at all. Didn’t you write to them last week? asks the same question as Did you write to them last week? In such questions the not/n’t works simply as a kind of question tag, a telescoped version of You did write to them last week, didn’t you? It makes a kind of leading question (see under that heading)."

They make a double platform in any argument, and elegant parallelism – provided the syntax of the two points is exactly the same. In the next example, this isn’t quite so: \n He sees them as not only strengthening small communities, but also as actually beginning to reverse the population flows from the countryside to the towns. \n The words “as actually” following but also impair the parallelism somewhat, and a tighter effect would be gained by omitting them: \n He sees them as not only strengthening small communities, but also beginning to reverse the population flows . . . \n More could be done to it, but the sentence does now make the most of the correlatives with the same verbal form (-ing) following. The writer may of course prefer not to make too much of the potential for parallelism, feeling that it’s a syntactic straitjacket.

The reader has to work harder with ones such as not unoriginal or not incompetent, to decide where the emphasis lies in them. Instead of negating the other word, not tempers its force; and so not unoriginal means “having some originality” rather than “most original.” Occasional expressions like this can contribute to the subtlety of an analysis, though, as already indicated, they present some obstacles for the reader, and look mannered if used too often.

(See agreement sections 3, 4 and 5.) \n The idiom nothing to do with has conventionally been preceded by has, and this is still true in American English. But in British English an alternative form is nothing to do with is also in use: \n This murder has nothing to do with poachers. \n Sexual passion is nothing to do with age. \n Is nothing to do with was first noted in the earlier C20 by Fowler (1926) and Jespersen (1909–1949). Its currency in late C20 is vindicated by a total of 66 examples in the BNC, of which just under half appear in written texts, and are therefore as the writer/editor intended.

In collocations like notorious gambler/trouble-maker, the negative values are really expressed through the nouns rather than the adjective. Yet notorious now seems to carry a negative meaning by default – “well known typically for some bad quality or deed” (New Oxford, 1998). Merriam-Webster (2000) notes that the neutral meaning “well known” is rare. For notoriety, the neutral meaning is not quite so rare in the UK or the US. It lends itself to situations where “fame” would be inappropriate, as when a company gained notoriety for backing GP, the failed MGM studio film owner. Thus a well-publicized failure may amount to notoriety, as can unorthodox kinds of celebrity: \n CF gained notoriety as one of Paris’s most flamboyant dress designers. \n In data from the BNC about 10% of examples of notoriety referred to reputations made in unorthodox or inverted ways, where the word is neutral rather than inherently negative. \n Notoriety can also refer to an individual with a reputation of any kind, as in a racing/sporting notoriety, and has been used this way since 1837, by the Oxford Dictionary (1989) record.

The following noun phrase shows how the basic head can be embellished: \n those very fine old Greek vases from the site of an ancient temple \n (premodifiers) head (postmodifiers) \n As the example shows, the noun phrase is premodified by determiners and adjectives (one or more). General enumerators like all or some could come before the determiners: all those very fine . . . , while cardinal numbers come between the determiner and the adjectives: those two very fine old Greek . . . When there are two or more adjectives, their order is from least to most specific, so that the most definitive one (Greek) is closest to the head, and any evaluative ones ( fine) are further away. Adverbs (such as very) come in front of the adjective which they modify. \n The example also shows how postmodification often involves prepositional phrases, one after another (from the site / of an ancient temple). Just occasionally an adjective or adjectival form of a verb comes immediately after the head, as in fine old Greek vases retrieved from . . . The postmodification may also involve a relative clause: old Greek vases that came from the site of an ancient temple. \n Noun phrases are all too easily extended with another and yet another phrase – an unfortunate feature of some of the least readable prose styles.

They represent opposite ends of a semantic scale from highly differentiated things to very generalized concepts. Even among concrete nouns, the scale gives us ones which are more general than others: compare feline, cat, siamese, seal-point. (See further under abstract nouns.) \n The terms common noun and proper noun draw a sharp distinction between general words and very particular names. Effectively common nouns refer to a class of entities, objects or persons, e.g. town, adult, whereas proper nouns single out individual cases, and are therefore capitalized. They purport to be unique names, even if there’s more than one Canterbury in the world, and more than a few John Hardys in any metropolis.

		"title": "number",
		"explanation":"To a grammarian, number is the concept above and beyond singular/plural – the idea that language may refer to one thing or to more than one, and that this distinction is shown in the form of words. In English it’s most obvious with nouns, most of which add an extra suffix or change in some way for the plural (see further under plurals). Apart from being expressed in nouns, number also affects the English pronoun system, in the distinction between I and we, etc., and in the present tense of all verbs except the modals. For example goes, the singular form for the third person, contrasts with the plural go, and in this case the singular adds the suffix. (See further under -s.) \n The convention that singular pronouns/nouns go with singular verbs, and plural with plural is fundamental to English syntax. Thus number underlies the principle of agreement between the subject and verb of a clause, and between pronouns and their antecedents in the same sentence or successive ones. But the application of the principle is not straightforward for several types of word and phrase (see further under agreement). \n Issues of number and singular/plural agreement also come up within the noun phrase itself, especially those involving a possessive or quasi-possessive element. The position of the possessive apostrophe expresses singular or plural (singular before the s, and plural after it). But in cases such as the visitors book, it seems arguable either way. Visitors could be regarded as a plural reference to all those expected to sign the visitors’ book, or a generic reference in the singular: the visitor’s book. In the final analysis it makes no difference, hence the trend toward leaving the apostrophe out altogether (see apostrophes section 2). \n Similar issues arise in reciprocal constructions like the following: \n The students all saw each others messages. \n Married women sometimes use their husbands initials. \n In the first sentence, the presence of each seems to demand the singular other’s, while all and messages suggests the plural form (see further under other’s or others’). In the second, their suggests the need for plural husbands’ – whereas the singular husband’s seems more in keeping with the principles of monogamy. The semantics of the sentence are too complex to be sorted out by the apostrophe, and where you place it is entirely arbitrary."

		"title": "numbers and number style",
		"explanation":"How to write and print numbers is partly a question of what field you’re working in. In mathematics, statistics, science, or technical or commercial writing, there’s every reason to present numbers as Arabic numerals. They are by far the most direct and efficient way to communicate quantities. In literary or humanistic writing, the occasional number will more than likely be written in words. But in any kind of writing, the following kinds of numbers are almost always given as figures: \n * sums of money: $30.65 \n * weights and measures: 16 kilometres \n * percentages: 17 percent \n * dates: 22 October 1995 (see further under dates) \n * times of day: 5.30 a.m., 17 hours. \n Times expressed with o’clock are normally written as words (eleven o’clock rather than 11 o’clock) according to the Chicago Manual (2003) and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002). \n Other points of number style: \n 1 Numbers as figures. Strings of figures are hard to read, and the maximum number of digits set solid is four. However this only happens in the case of a whole number, as in The mountain is 2379 m above sea level. Numbers consisting of more than four digits are grouped in threes on either side of the decimal point: \n 1 515 069 \n 15 150.69 \n 1.515 069 \n The international standard (ISO 31:1992) recommends using thin space between each set of digits, which helps to prevent large numbers being divided at line breaks. This is the preferred style for scientific and mathematical texts in American and British English, according to the Chicago Manual (2003) and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002). But in the context of nonscientific and “general” books, commas are allowed instead of space to separate the sets of digits in front of the decimal point. Those after it are run together: \n 15,150.69111 \n This use of commas runs counter to that of the ISO recommendation observed in continental Europe, where a comma is used as the decimal point (the decimal comma). So 15 150, 69111 would correspond to the number quoted just above. The decimal comma has yet to be established in British or American style, and attempts to introduce it into Australian alongside metrication in the 1970s have not succeeded. Only in Canada is the decimal comma an option alongside the decimal point, following their dual endorsement by the Metric Commission in 1971. But where commas are used to separate groups of integers, the decimal comma can only add confusion. All this shows why the use of (thin) space as the separator has much to recommend it. \n The decimal point is now always set low on the line of type (as recommended by the Royal Society), and can thus be distinguished from the mathematical multiplication point or raised dot. (See further under multiplier symbol.) \n 2 In spans of numbers (i.e. inclusive numbers), how many digits should be repeated? This question is usually raised in connection with page numbers, and there is less divergence now than there used to be. British style has always been economical, recommending that only the changed digit be given, as in pp. 32–5, pp. 131–6, except when the span involves the second decade. The numbers there are deemed to be “single rather than compound” (Oxford Guide to Style, 2002), and so two digits must be given, as in pp. 112–17. In American style (Chicago Manual, 2003) two digits are always given in spans below 100 (as in pp. 32–35) and above 110 (as in pp. 131–36). But in the first decade above each hundred, just one digit is given, as in pp. 103–5. (See further under dates section 1.) \n 3 Numbers as words. Where numbers occur only occasionally in a text, they’re usually spelled out as words. Still it depends on how large the number is – or rather, what threshold the writer/editor sets for using figures rather than words. Any threshold is arbitrary, and may have to be overriden in context. For nontechnical writing, the Chicago Manual (2003) and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) both set the upper threshold for numbers as words at 100. Other style guides, e.g. those of newspapers, set the general threshold at 20 or 10, while reserving the right to use words for occasional round numbers: twenty, fifty, a hundred. Whatever the threshold, there may be anomalies when numbers above and below it have to be cited in the same sentence: \n There were 19 letters on Thursday, and only eight on Friday (assuming the threshold is 10) \n Consistency calls for both numbers to be treated the same way in the same sentence – as either words, or figures. If the comparison between the two numbers is important, figures speak louder than the words: \n There were 19 letters on Thursday, and only 8 on Friday. \n Style guides all recommend against using a figure at the start of a sentence: \n Nineteen letters came on Thursday and only eight on Friday. \n The sentence could of course be reworded to avoid having a number as the first item. \n The choice between figures and words gives a writer alternatives when there are numbers from different sets to express in the same sentence: \n The two-day course had 5 participants on the first day, and 12 on the second. \n As the examples show, a single threshold for writing numbers as words/figures can be difficult to maintain. In practice we may need to write numbers of similar size as words or as figures in nonscientific writing. In science and technical writing they would normally all be figures, though the Oxford Guide stll suggests a threshold for writing numbers as words in technical contexts. \n 4 Punctuating number words. Hyphens are regularly used in the numbers from twenty-one to ninety-nine, according to Copy-editing (1992) and the Chicago Manual (2003). Contemporary databases show that both British and American writers do this. Yet when it comes to fractions, British writers seem less committed to using the hyphen. Amid hundreds of examples, both two-thirds and two thirds are used, though the hyphened form appears about three times as often as the other. American writers mostly use the hyphen, in comparable data on two(-)thirds from CCAE. This is a little surprising, given that American English generally makes less use of hyphens than the British (see hyphens). \n Note that when numbers are pluralized, they take the same kind of plural suffix as other words with the same final letter: ones, twos, fours, sixes, twenties. \n 5 Roman numerals are given in upper case, when they appear as part of a title (George VI) or family name (Adlai Stevenson III). See further under names section 5. But when they refer to such things as the introductory pages of a book, or the subsection of a play, they appear in lower case: Romeo and Juliet Act iii Scene 2. Note that the volume numbers of journals are usually expressed in Arabic numbers nowadays, though it was once the convention to give them in Roman numerals. \n 6 Enumerating lists of headings and subheadings. Roman numerals are still widely used in alternation with Arabic ones, and/or with alphabetic letters to enumerate the sections of a document. By using all three, together with strategic use of full stops and single as well as double brackets, a large number of different levels of heading can be identified. For example: \n Level A I II III IV \n  Level B A. B. C. D. \n Level C 1. 2. 3. 4. \n  Level D a) b) c) d) \n Level E i) ii) iii) iv) \n Level F (1) (2) (3) (4) \n Level G (a) (b) (c) (d) \n and so on. If only two or three levels of heading are needed, any subset of those enumerators would do. Many reports simply use 1,2,3 etc. for main headings, and 1.1,1.2,1.3. etc. for the subheadings. \n 7 Indenting enumerators. Each level of enumeration is indented on the previous one, the amount of indention depending on how many levels have to be catered for. When there are many levels, the standard 1 em is as much as can be allowed, but with only two or three levels, a 2 em indent is manageable and effective: \n 1. \n  1.1 \n   1.11 \n   1.12 \n 1. \n  2.1 \n    2.11 \n   2.2 \n   2.21 \n    2.22 \n When Roman numerals serve as enumerators, they are normally aligned on the right-hand side: \n i) \n ii) \n iii) \n iv) \n This makes for more consistent vertical spacing on the page. (See further under indents.) \n ♦ For the use of different typefaces and settings for each level, see under headings and subheadings."

O pure and simple is associated with religion and with high literary style: \n O God our help in ages past \n O wild west wind, thou breath of autumn’s being \n As in those examples, it prefaces an apostrophe to the supreme being, and supernatural or abstract forces. (See further under apostrophe.) The same spelling is the one used in hymnbooks, whether the saints above or below are being invoked. It always appears with a capital letter. \n The spelling Oh is the ordinary, everyday exclamation which expresses various emotions from surprise and delight to disappointment and regret, depending on the context. It also serves as a pause filler in spontaneous outbursts: \n I’d be there like a shot, but oh . . . who would look after things here? \n Other uses of Oh are to be found in the worried expression Oh dear! as well as in addressing other people: Oh Kim, would you put the kettle on. As the examples show, Oh doesn’t necessarily have a capital letter, nor is it always followed by a comma or full stop. \n Oh/oh sometimes serves as the written form of the number 0, especially in sets of two or more numbers. It stands for 0 in quoted phone numbers or post/zip codes, for Americans as well as the British (Burchfield, 1996).

		"title": "-o",
		"explanation":"Most words ending in -o in English are borrowings made more or less recently from Italian and Spanish, such as fiasco, piano, merino, mulatto. A handful come from Latin (hero, veto), Greek (echo), and from non-European sources (calico, dingo). Since about 1700 the assimilation of such words into English involved forming their plurals with -es, in parallel with the plurals of words ending in y,which still become -ies. These spelling adjustments also affected verbs ending in -o and -y for the third person singular present form: he/she/it echoes and he/she/it replies. A few monosyllabic English formations ending in -o, i.e. do, go, no behave the same way as verbs and/or nouns (does, goes, noes). While the -oes spelling mostly stands firm for verbal use of these words, it is slowly but surely disappearing from the older borrowed nouns, and not being implemented at all in newer loanwords and recent English formations. Let’s look first at the nouns. \n 1 Nouns ending in -o. Although it varies from word to word, the general trend towards using simple -s plurals instead of -es emerged clearly from the Langscape survey (1998–2001) of more than 1100 people worldwide. It is stronger in the northern hemisphere (putting together results for the UK [488], Europe [251] and the US/Canada [175]) than in southeast Asia and Australia. The simple -s plurals were embraced more keenly by the younger respondents (under 45) than older ones. Current usage is thus cutting back on the -o words accorded -es plurals, from the tally of 29 indicated in Hart’s Rules (1983). The Langscape survey tested 20 common examples, and of those only 3 were clearly endorsed with -oes: \n echoes heroes tomatoes \n For volcano(e)s the result was 50/50. Potato – which might be expected to go the same way as tomato – was not included in the survey. But simple -s plurals were preferred by the majority of respondents for: \n avocados banjos buffalos cargos \n fiascos flamingos frescos ghettos \n halos innuendos mangos mementos \n mosquitos mottos tornados torpedos \n This doesn’t make the -es plural unacceptable for such words, and they continue to be listed in the major dictionaries. It does mean that they look increasingly old-fashioned. Plurals with -es are out of place with many kinds of words to which they were never attached, or are not normally now. They include: \n ∗ words where the -o follows another vowel: bamboo, embryo, pistachio, portfolio, radio, ratio, rodeo, studio, taboo, video \n ∗ words with four or more syllables: archipelago, armadillo, diminuendo, generalissimo, manifesto, obligato, peccadillo \n ∗ foreign borrowings: calico, calypso, casino, flamenco, gigolo, inferno, kimono, piccolo, placebo, poncho, proviso, sombrero, stiletto \n ∗ abbreviations: auto, curio, hippo, homo, kilo, memo, photo, physio, piano, pro, rhino \n ∗ informal coinages where a longer word or phrase has been cut back and sealed with the suffix -o: ammo (“ammunition”), nutso (“an eccentric”), weirdo (“a weird person”). Australian English has a repertoire of words formed with -o: for people, milko (“milkman”), wino (“alcoholic”) etc.; and for inanimates, arvo (“afternoon”), compo (“compensation”). Ambo can be “ambassador” or “ambulance”, according to context. \n Where the plurals of nouns ending in -o are reverting from -es to the regular -s, usage will be variable. Writers and editors may decide the issue word by word, or across the whole set. Either way it’s unlikely to impinge on readers, because the words concerned are scattered across many fields, and do not often rub shoulders. Those concentrated in the field of music (concerto, divertimento, solo, soprano) can safely be written with just -s, unless you prefer to italianize them as concerti etc. (see Italian plurals). But pity the greengrocer who has to label the more exotic avocados, babacos, tamarillos alongside humble potatoes and tomatoes, for his spelling-conscious customers. \n 2 Verbs ending in -o. The diminishing use of -oes for nouns ending in -o does not seem to affect the spelling of the third person singular, present tense, at least in British English. BNC data on echo and veto for that part of the verb show only the -oes spelling, and it is supported by the regular past forms echoed and vetoed. Since almost half the instances of echo are verbal, this would help to explain why the noun plural is still generally spelled echoes, according to the Langscape result. Other verbs ending in -o (e.g. embargo, lasso, torpedo) may be expected to spell the third person singular, present tense with -oes, although only the past forms embargoed, lassoed, torpedoed are evidenced in the BNC. American English may however be closer to accepting plain -s forms for the third person singular, present tense – as well as the plural noun. Data from CCAE provides a handful of examples for verbal use of echos, lassos and vetos, but only for lassos do they make a majority. See further under lasso. \n International English selection: Given the widespread trend toward regular -s plurals for nouns ending in -o, it makes sense to standardize on them even for those on which usage is still variable – as is done in this book."

		"title": "object",
		"explanation":"An essential yet elusive concept in English grammar is the object. It is a key element of clause structure, though not all clauses have them (see predicate and transitive). Some clauses effectively have two objects of different kinds, one direct and the other indirect. It takes several definitions to show the range of things a direct object can be, let alone the indirect kind. \n 1 Direct objects can be the target, goal or product of the action of the verb: \n She moved the bed over to the window. \n He baked a pizza for lunch. \n The object can also express the arena or extent of the action: \n They could weed the garden. \n The students walk 5 km to school. \n The direct object is sometimes a person affected by the action, as in: \n They put their mother into hospital. \n In spite of their variety, these objects have one thing in common: they would all be the item identified if you took the verb and asked what/who? immediately after. \n He baked what? a pizza \n They put who into hospital? their mother \n The test still works with some of the less obvious kinds of objects, which do not fit into any of the categories described so far because the verbs concerned are mental processes. For example: \n They expected a big majority. \n In these cases the object must be seen as the phenomenon (Halliday, 1994). \n 2 Indirect objects only appear when there’s already a direct object in the clause. They are associated particularly with a group of verbs that express the idea of transmitting something, or making something change hands; and the indirect object is the person or thing that receives whatever is being transmitted. \n They sent the agent a confirmatory fax. \n He gave the door a kick. \n As the examples show, the indirect object precedes the direct object. If the two were in reverse order, the indirect object would have to be expressed through a prepositional phrase: \n They sent a confirmatory fax to the agent. \n Grammarians then debate whether that final phrase is still an indirect object or whether it should be regarded as a prepositional phrase. Traditional grammars took the former view, while contemporary grammars like the Comprehensive Grammar of English (1985) and the Longman Grammar (1999) regard it as a prepositional object. \n In traditional grammar the case of the direct object is referred to as the accusative, and that of the indirect object (without any preposition) as the dative. They are identical in form however, whether they’re nouns or pronouns. \n 3 The position of the object. In statements, objects normally follow the verb, as in the examples above. That order is occasionally altered in conversation, to highlight the object in front of both subject and verb: \n Roses she liked better than anything. \n (See further under information focus.) \n In questions seeking discursive answers, the object is regularly put up front: \n Which newspaper do you prefer? \n What will they do now? \n Final notes: \n ∗ The verbal object can be either a noun phrase, as in previous examples, or a noun clause. Compare: \n The teachers spoke their mind. \n The teachers said what was on their mind. \n (See further under noun clause.) \n ∗ Any noun phrase governed by a preposition is its object, in traditional grammar terms: see prepositions."

In British English obliged to is far more common, with hundreds of BNC examples occurring in all kinds of discourse – whereas the dozen or so of obligated to are mostly from spoken material. The auxiliary-like role is found in more than 90% of all instances of obliged to, and constructions in which it expressed a personal obligation were relatively rare: \n Many are obliged to us for the work they get here. \n However the sense of personal obligation remains in the collocation much obliged: \n “I’m much obliged” the would-be warehouse-breaker replied, shaking the policeman by the hand. \n Americans make much more use of obligated to as an alternative to obliged to. In CCAE’s extensive written data, the two are used almost equally often as marginal auxiliaries, and obligated to appears where the British might expect obliged to: \n We’re obligated to help mankind. \n  Crews are obligated to be under way within two hours of notification. \n In American but not British English, obligated is used to mean “financially bonded”: \n All aid for the rebels had already been obligated for other groups. \n This sense is also used attributively, as in obligated parent (i.e. one legally obliged to provide child support).

However the Oxford Dictionary (1989) says that it can “no longer be regarded as erroneous,” and simply notes that the newer meaning is often though not always associated with the use of to after it. British writers in the BNC mostly use oblivious to mean “unaware,” but this sense is in no way restricted to oblivious to. Most cases of oblivious of refer to present rather than past circumstances.

Yet the simple active construction has been on record since the 1880s, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and does show its face in current British English, as in BNC examples such as: \n The thought of being parted obsessed them. \n Nothing new there, however some of the active-transitive uses of obsess are reflexive: \n Wayne has more things to obsess him than himself. \n Don’t obsess yourself with the idea that . . . \n From these it’s only a relatively small step to the intransitive construction (see transitive and intransitive). Obsess thus becomes a mental process verb like worry, as in: \n I went around obsessing about whether or not I seemed like . . . I’m obsessing when I want to be impacting. \n The intransitive use of obsess, and this absolute use is still rare in British English, by BNC evidence (see absolute section 3). It may sound like the cutting edge of idiom. In American English the intransitive is familiar though less common than the transitive, by their relative frequencies in CCAE. Americans make more use of all constructions with obsess than the British, and of a variety of intransitive collocations, using about, over or on. \n She obsesses about an elderly neighbor. \n He obsesses over money. \n We obsess on our own personal health but we oppose national health. \n The order of these examples shows the relative frequency of the three types of collocation, about being the commonest. \n These grammatical developments from passive obsessed to intransitive obsess reflect semantic shifts – or is it the other way round? At any rate external pressures on people can become internal neuroses – hence the idiom: stop obsessing."

The regular “ODing” is not registered anywhere, and lends itself to misreading – as could ODed. The apostrophed forms work best also for the verb KO (“knock out, defeat”) as in KO’d, KO’ing.

		"title": "-odd and odd",
		"explanation":"Minimizing the use of hyphens is more typical of Americans than the British (see hyphens), and on the whole it makes for tidier and no less readable text. But in this case it creates a problem. Compare \n a table with twenty-odd books in a heap \n with \n a table with twenty odd books in a heap \n In the first, -odd works as an approximator, whether the number is in figures or words. In the second it seems to be a fully fledged adjective meaning “peculiar.” The hyphen solves the problem in writing, whereas speakers quite often preface the number with some to underscore the interpretation of “odd” as -odd: “some twenty odd books were on the table.” (For the use of some as approximator, see some.) This use of some together with -odd is strictly redundant in writing, yet it gets carried over into written texts in both BNC and CCAE: \n The liberation army drove out some 2000-odd armed white right-wingers. \n In written examples, the numbers to which -odd is attached are very often figures, especially in American English. This is however determined by the writer/editor’s policy on the writing of numbers. See numbers and number style section 3. "

		"title": "odious, odorous, odiferous and odoriferous",
		"explanation":"The first word is the odd one out. All the rest have something to do with odors; whereas odious with its roots in odium (“hatred,” “repugnance”) means “offensive.” Yet odious is sometimes confused with odorous, as in “odorous comparisons” (see malapropisms). The confusion is no doubt fed by their similar forms, and the fact that both have emotive force. Odious is always negative, whereas odorous may or may not be, depending on context. \n Odorous, odiferous and odoriferous all have to do with strong affecting smells, and the number of syllables makes little difference to the meaning. The connotations can be good or bad, witness: \n the odorous soft bed of the receding sea . . . dredged from odorous mud \n Odorous is also used neutrally by chemists, as in odorous substances. In British English, odorous is the only one of the three “odor” words in regular use, by the evidence of the BNC. Americans meanwhile make roughly equal use of odorous and odoriferous in CCAE data (odiferous remains rare). Again the words can have good or bad connotations, but the latter are definitely more common. Sometimes it’s a matter of taste, as with the odoriferous durian, that notorious/delectable Asian fruit. What the nose responds to is probably culture-bound, and indeed species-bound. In English it seems that most anything “on the nose” is distasteful. But if the effect needs to be spelled out, there’s malodorous for the bad smell and fragrant for the good."

		"title": "oe/e",
		"explanation":"The oe digraph is one of the eccentricities of modern English. It is built into the spelling of a few common words, such as shoe, toe, canoe; and into the plurals of some ending in -o, such as echoes and heroes. In short, everyday words like those, it’s a regular part of the spelling. But in longer and less common ones such as innuendo(e)s and memento(e)s, the plurals are increasingly spelled without the e. (See further under -o.) \n Another set of words in which oe is being slowly reduced to one letter (this time to e) includes Greek loanwords such as am(o)eba, diarrh(o)ea, hom(o)eopath, (o)edema, (o)estrogen, all put to scientific purposes in English but part of the general vocabulary as well. The oe digraph is in fact a Latin rendering of the Greek diphthong oi, so that its pedigree is a bit limited. The digraph became a ligature in earlier English, and is still printed as such in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). But Fowler argued for its being printed as the digraph oe, and British English has standardized it that way (see further under ae/e). In American English the ligatured oe was replaced by e, hence the alternative standard spellings. \n These regional differences are not absolute, by the evidence of the Langscape survey (1998–2001), and individual words vary somewhat. The expected differences held for diarrh(o)ea, (o)esophagus, (o)estrogen, where the oe spellings were endorsed by about 90% of British respondents, and the e spellings by more than 90% of Americans. Yet a majority of the British (71%) also accepted homeopathy, and, more surprisingly, about 80% of Americans were ready to endorse amoeba (though this may reflect the fact that it’s foregrounded in the Webster’s Third [1961/86] entry as the scientific name of the genus). Other research shows growing acceptance of fetus in British English (Sigley, 1999); see fetus. A majority of Australians who have traditionally followed British spelling habits in this area seem ready to endorse both diarrhea and homeopath (Peters, 1995). Canadians tend to use e spellings in most such words, and to see oe as British, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). \n Whether these shifting preferences will affect others in the same set of words remains to be seen. British writers who accept homeopathy might now be content with homeostatic, homeothermic, homeotransplant. The Australian endorsement of diarrhea could pave the way for dysmenorrhea, gonorrhea, logorrhea etc. The more technical words are however often the preserve of specialists, who present concerted professional resistance to “popular” moves for change. Some argue that the oe is more etymological and therefore informative, which is dubious on both counts. The oe is not the original Greek spelling, as we have seen; and readers without Greek are unlikely to make anything of the spelling of a syllable – much more likely to take the word’s sense from the whole. \n No-one would turn the clock back on words like ecology, economic, ecumenical, all of which originally began with oe in English. They show the natural tendency to simplify the ligature to e rather than enlarge it to a digraph. It can happen at the start of a word, though some find it a barrier to recognizing the word. The simplification has an obvious value when it reduces odd sequences of vowels in the middle of a word from three to two, as in homeopathy and diarrhea. \n International English selection: The plain e spellings recommend themselves instead of the digraph oe for general written discourse, for the various reasons discussed. They are established in both US and Canadian English, gaining ground in Australia, and accepted in some cases even in Britain. Note: oe remains as is when the two letters belong to different syllables, as in words like coefficient, gastroenteritis, poem, whoever, and in loanwords from modern German, such as roentgen, where the oe represents an umlauted vowel (see umlaut). \n ♦ On the choice between manoeuvre and maneuver, see manoeuvre."

		"title": "of and ’ve",
		"explanation":"Of is the most common preposition in written discourse, because of its multiple roles in joining words and phrases. Most of these are uncontroversial, and they provide useful alternatives to other constructions. \n ∗ Nouns and noun phrases are linked by of, as in cup of tea and no hope of a golden handshake. As in those examples, it connects the syntactic head and semantic anchor with the finer detail of the utterance. Of helps to paraphrase possessive expressions, as in the assistance of the parents for the parents’ assistance. On occasions it seems to duplicate the possessive, as in that friend of Jim’s: see double genitive. \n ∗ Verbs are linked with their complements, whether they are phrases as in think of England, or nonfinite clauses, as in think of going to England. For verbs like convince, inform, persuade, remind, tell, warn the of construction is a nonfinite alternative to other kinds of finite clause: \n The letter reminded us of their coming. \n The letter reminded us that they were coming. \n ∗ Adjectives use of to connect with their complements, as in aware/mindful/suspicious of. Again these can be paraphrased with finite clauses: \n The police were aware of their threat to the neighbors. \n The police were aware that they threatened the neighbors. \n ∗ Adverbial expressions of habitual time may be constructed with of, for example: \n Of an evening, guests dine by candlelight. \n In Athens, a woman can walk the streets of an evening without fear . . . \n This of construction and its genitive equivalent evenings (as in everything tapers off Sundays and evenings) are both relatively rare in British and American English, by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE. Their place has been taken by adverbial phrases in the evening or in the evenings. On the fringe in both databases is on evenings, a natural extension of on Saturdays, but still more American than British idiom. (See on/in.) \n Other issues with of. \n ∗ in noun phrases. The of that appears in definite quantitative phrases such as both of the letters may be omitted, as in both the letters. The same holds for all of the and half of the (see half of the, and all and all of). This allows all/both/half to be used as predeterminers (see under determiners), which is not possible for indefinite quantifiers such as some / several / a few. Of cannot be omitted from phrases like some of the letters. \n ∗ in verb phrases. Of has no place in the verb phrase – though it’s sometimes mistakenly used there instead of have. No doubt this results from the fact that have is commonly reduced to ’ve in continuous speech, and then sounds identical with of. Thus could of appears for could ’ve, may of for may ’ve, might of for might ’ve, should of for should ’ve, would of for would ’ve. By the same process had of sometimes appears for had ’ve, though there’s rarely any need for had have. See further under have final notes."

		"title": "off and off of",
		"explanation":"Off serves primarily as adverb and preposition of removal, as in: \n Take your shoes off. \n and \n Take your shoes off the seat. \n Off also appears as an adjective, with privative or negative meanings as when the electricity/game/joke/ milk is off. Idiomatic uses of off are also embodied compounds derived from phrasal verbs, such as castoff, selloff, showoff, spinoff, turnoff, writeoff. Gerunds based on such phrasal verbs take other nouns in tow, whereat off of is the necessary sequence: \n the selling off of irreplaceable books from the library \n with much showing off of their remarkable crests \n While this use of off of is unobjectionable, its use as a complex preposition raises stylistic eyebrows, at least in Britain. It probably stems from the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928), which noted that off of was “dialectal,” and in the second edition (1989) that it was “colloquial and dialectal.” The BNC certainly contains far more examples in spoken material (where one’s local identity is more readily expressed) than in written texts. Still there’s a sprinkling of the complex preposition in printed sources: \n Sinatra stormed off of the set of Carousel. \n Juniors are welcomed on and off of the courts. \n It will take some of the edge off of Gates’ competitiveness. \n In examples like those, off would be sufficient, and one can argue that the of is redundant. Yet in American English off of appears so often in print that it has idiomatic status, and is not edited out, as in British English. American writers use it freely in high- and lower-brow journalism in CCAE, as in: \n . . . keep the pressure off of interest rates The boat was salvaged off of Ireland. \n He shoveled snow off of his narrow driveway. \n Webster’s English Usage (1989) expresses reservations about using it in the most formal prose, but there’s no doubt that off of is thoroughly established. \n Both off of and off tend to attract negative comment when they appear instead of from, as in: \n They downloaded it off of the internet. \n I got it off my grandfather. \n Objections against the first sentence are probably fueled by the (relative) informality of style, and the seemingly redundant use of of noted before. Sentences of the second type, using off for from, were barely tolerable in informal speech, according to Mittins et al.’s informants (1970), and not at all in writing. The structure is also potentially ambiguous. Does it mean “my grandfather gave it to me,” or “I extracted it from my grandfather’s keeping”? There’s the heart of the problem. Allusive expression is acceptable and probably clear enough in conversation, but in prose it creates ambiguities which are to be avoided."

OK needs no stops, given the trend away from using them in abbreviations consisting solely of capitals (see abbreviations section 2).

It was first recorded in Boston in 1839, and remained an Americanism until the 1920s. Some have sought its etymology in an American Indian language, others in European immigrant languages including French, Finnish, Scots English and especially German. A likely explanation is that the letters stand for “Oll Korrect,” a humorous misspelling of all correct. A.W. Read’s research (reported in the Oxford Dictionary, 1989) also suggests that the abbreviation gained rapid acceptance because the initials coincided with “Old Kinderhook,” nickname of Martin van Buren (US president 1837–41), who came from the Dutch community of Kinderhook, New York."

Yet as a noun Olympian can refer to either one of the mythological inhabitants of Mount Olympus, or someone who has competed at the the modern Olympic games. Those who participate in the Olympics, and especially those who “bring home gold,” do indeed seem to attain the status of demigods via the media. \n The associated word Olympiad also has both ancient and modern meanings.

In American and Canadian English, an ombudsman hears complaints within a particular institution or associated with a particular cause, e.g. human rights ombudsman. \n In English ombudsman looks less than gender-neutral, hence the creation of the more inclusive ombudsperson in the 1980s. But it hardly makes a mark in British or American data from the BNC/CCAE. The suggestion that the original Swedish provides its own gender-free term (ombud) was taken up in some American universities (Maggio, 1988), but has had little impact elsewhere.

The analogue in television is presenting in quick succession the separately screened episodes of a popular program. (If a plural is needed, it would be omnibuses: see -us section 4.)

		"explanation":"The -on ending is the mark of Greek loanwords or neoclassical formations in various academic disciplines. Those used include: \n anacoluthon asyndeton criterion \n  etymon oxymoron phenomenon \n Because these were borrowed from Greek, they all come with Greek plurals in -a, which can be reliably maintained alongside the singular forms in specialist discourse. But criterion/criteria and phenomenon/phenomena also occur freely in general writing, where their identity as singular/plural is not necessarily understood – nor do the contexts necessarily make it plain. This is why criteria and phenomena are not uncommonly interpreted as singular forms in current English. See further under criterion, and phenomenon. \n Other Greek-derived words ending in -on usually take -s plurals in English. This is true of neoclassical scientific and scholarly words such as automaton, electron, lexicon, neutron, photon, proton, skeleton. Only ganglion is more likely to appear with an -a plural. \n Many English words ending in -on have no Greek connections, or are so fully assimilated that the -on works as part of the stem. The following are just a token of these, which always have -s plurals: \n canon cauldron chevron crayon \n deacon demon melon pylon \n tenon In a small set of C20 formations, -on is a suffix meaning “synthetic material,” as in nylon, orlon, teflon.

		"title": "one",
		"explanation":"This word has several roles in English, some of which are uncomplicated. Its use is straightforward when it’s the first number in a counting system (one, two, three), and when it appears as a substitute word for nouns and noun phrases, as in: \n I’d like a ticket. This man needs one too. \n  The children were at school but one of them had gone on an excursion. \n The most critical usage questions for one are when it’s used as a substitute personal pronoun as in: \n What can one say to that? \n Just which personal pronoun one replaces is not entirely clear. Historically it’s a third person pronoun, though the context could make it I or you (or both of us; Wales, 1996). Often it seems detached, not as ego-centred as I, nor as direct in its address as you. Sometimes called the indefinite pronoun, its very indeterminacy makes it ideal in certain situations. British writers make considerable use of it, but Americans find it rather formal. \n Because one has no regular place in the pronoun system, it’s unclear which pronoun should agree with it. This leaves several possibilities: \n One just has to do one’s best. \n One just has to do his best. \n One just has to do her best. \n One just has to do their best. \n The choice is a mostly a matter of style. The second option using his is the oldest, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), but has been under attack during the last 200 years by usage commentators who preferred the first option with one’s. It has the virtue of consistency and is gender-free. Yet the repetition of one in possessive form draws attention to its awkwardness, and it sounds pompous to American and Australian ears. Neither the second option with his nor the third with her are usable now, because of their perceived sexism. This leaves us with the fourth option – even though it has been subject to grammatical criticism because it follows the singular one with the plural their. That kind of agreement is however increasingly common after other indefinite pronouns such as anyone, everyone, someone, and avoids gender complications. (See agreement section 3, and they, them, their.) \n Whichever pronoun you choose, it should be used consistently: i.e. one/one’s/oneself or one/their/ themself or themselves.

It usually focuses on the one following, and the point of the sentence changes according to where it’s placed: \n Only the secretary received the letter. (nobody else got one) \n The secretary only received the letter. (did not open it) \n The secretary received only the letter (not the cheque) \n In conversation the placement of only is less critical, because intonation can extend the “spotlight” over several words to the one which matters. (With extended intonation we could make the word order of the second sentence communicate the meaning of the third.) But in writing, only must be adjacent to the crucial word or phrase to ensure its full effectiveness. (See further under information focus.) \n  Only has a minor role as a conjunction expressing contrast, in sentences like: \n He’ll certainly come, only don’t hold the performance up for him. \n For some, this usage smacks too much of conversation to be suitable for formal writing. It was rejected by 85% of the Harper–Heritage usage panel. Yet its written record began in C14, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and Webster’s English Usage (1989) has enough recent citations to deem it standard. Those who find it too informal may replace it with but or except that, as appropriate."

		"title": "onomatopoeia",
		"explanation":"This unlikely word refers to a figure of speech, as well as one of the ways in which words are formed. In both kinds of onomatopoeia, the word or words seem to express the sound of the very thing they refer to or represent. Individual words such as croak, hiss, miaou, neigh, quack, rustle, splash probably owe their origins to ad hoc creation of a word on the stimulus of sound. This correlates with the fact that they have no relatives among English words or even in other languages, where the same sounds are represented by different words. Yet within English not only words, but individual sounds are sometimes felt to have equivalents in terms of meaning. (See further under phonesthemes.) \n  Onomatopoeia can also be generated as a figure of speech from sets of ordinary words which are strategically put together. Again the words seem to hint at sounds associated with whatever is being described. Poets of all ages have enriched their work with onomatopoeia, as did Gerard Manley Hopkins in the opening lines of God’s Grandeur: \n The world is charged with the grandeur of God \n It will flame out, like shining from shook foil \n It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil Crushed. \n The words provide “sound” support for the two images: that of static electricity breaking out from metal foil when it’s shaken, and the viscous spread of a heavy liquid. Apart from the onomatopoeic effect of the words, Hopkins makes use of alliteration and simile in those lines. (See further under figures of speech.) \n Advertisers find uses for onomatopoeia in marketing their product, as did the makers of Rice Bubbles / Krispies with their “snap, crackle, pop” slogan. The same effect has been sought when the product is marketed in non-English-speaking countries. So in Sweden it’s “piff, paff, puff ”; in parts of Germany “knisper, knasper, knusper”; and in South Africa “klap, knotter, kraak.” It confirms that the sound effects of words are relative to a particular language, not universal."

		"title": "onto or on to",
		"explanation":"The preposition onto was used alongside on to for more than a century before British usage commentators (Alford, 1863) censured it. The objection seems to be total – that onto should never be used. Closer investigation shows that it has its place, but needs to be distinguished from on to. The difference betwen them is illustrated in the following: \n He went on to become a consultant engineer. \n Much of the material was passed on to other colleagues. \n I journeyed on to Liverpool. \n The dog leapt onto one of the machines. \n She cleared her desk onto the floor. \n The data can be written directly onto the screen. \n As the examples show, on to is necessary for phrasal verbs formed with on, where to introduces a separate constituent. But onto is more satisfactory for simple verbs of motion, because on to would seem to divide the movement into two aspects. Verbs like cling/fit/hang/hold/stick – used in their physical senses – mostly take onto. But in BNC data their more idiomatic uses are often on to, as in hold on to audiences. \n Note the use of onto in idioms for becoming aware of something or getting in touch with someone: \n He put me onto the Legal Section. \n  Next thing the police will be onto him. \n  I’ll get onto the agent tomorrow. \n In American English onto is now standard, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989); and in data from CCAE onto and on to are matched 1:1. In British usage onto also seems pretty secure, with the ratio 3:4 in data from the BNC – despite the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) preference for on to. The merged onto is as natural a combination as into. See into or in to."

While -onymy enshrines the Greek word onoma (“name”), -onomy is a composite of the combining vowel -o- and Greek nomia (“law,” “system”). The first ending is built into linguistic terms such as: \n  antonymy eponymy heteronymy \n homonymy hyponymy meronymy \n synonymy toponymy \n All are concerned with naming, or the relationships among words. Most are discussed under individual entries in this book. \n The second ending is familiar in tems such as: \n astronomy autonomy economy gastronomy \n These words refer to domains that are distinct systems or bodies of knowledge.

Both opaqueness and opacity work as the abstract noun for opaque, in its literal and more figurative senses (“obscure” / “lacking light and openness”).

The two serve equally for the literal sense in: \n  The fog rolled in with a flannel-like opacity. \n . . . qualities of opaqueness and opalescence in the glass \n And for the figurative in: \n prose of baroque opacity \n problems of ambiguity and opaqueness \n Though opaqueness is just as possible as opacity in terms of meaning, there’s a substantial difference in their relative frequency.

However the use of op.cit. is on the decline, and actively discouraged by some publishers such as the Chicago University Press. Its place is being taken by follow-up references with a short title instead: \n 1. See G. Blainey The Tyranny of Distance, p. 31. \n 5.

		"title": "opera and operetta",
		"explanation":"Since its origins in C17, opera has developed in scope and variety. There are large differences in scope between the one-hour music dramas of Scarlatti and the grand operas of Verdi. In the latter, the whole libretto is set to music, and its serious and heroic subject matter contrasts with that of opera buffa (or French opera bouffe ´ ) – names for comic opera in which the musical climaxes are embedded in recitative. French opera comique ´ combines plain spoken dialogue with the musical highlights, but is not necessarily comic in its substance, witness examples such as Carmen. In English the term operetta is used for (1) short operas of any variety, and (2) light operas whose subjects contrast with grand opera. Light opera in the second sense has much in common with musical comedy. Both deal with humorous or sentimental subjects, and one can hardly distinguish them except that the term musical comedy is usually applied to those which were composed more recently in the US, and are familiar through film as well as stage versions."

In secondary industry, operator may refer to persons with specific skills for a particular machine, e.g. lathe operator, switchboard operator, whereas operative is used for someone whose skills range over a process, as in cleaning operative, waste disposal operative. \n Outside the regular work force both words refer to persons with rather more power. Operator can be used to refer to the manager of a particular secondary or tertiary industry, as in mine operator, plant operator, cycle tour operator, photobooths operator. In colloquial use an operator is one who manipulates others: \n HB had always been a political giant, a supreme operator. \n Operative meanwhile has its own special applications, in reference to a secret agent, or a private detective."

Yet there’s a sprinkling of opthalmic in data from CCAE and the BNC; and an internet search (Google, 2003) found opthalmologist in 7% of all instances of the word. The spellings with opth- reflect common pronunciation of the first syllable as “op-,” which is registered as an alternative for both words in North American dictionaries (Merriam-Webster and the Canadian Oxford, 1998). The pronunciation with “op-,” and the nonstandard spelling, are both fostered by the much more familiar Latin stem for “eye”: optas in optical, optician, optometry. \n ♦ Compare diphtheria."

It far outnumbers opportunity of, by almost 8:1 in BNC data, and more than 30:1 in data from CCAE. This is in line with the observation of Webster’s English Usage (1989) that the of + gerund was more a British construction, though it had been commoner in the US until the 1970s. In Australian English it’s now rare (Peters, 1995). The third construction is more flexible than the first two, and permits several kinds of complement: abstract noun, gerund (rarely), and a person or persons, often the subject(s) of a following to-infinitive. \n the opportunity for hands-on experience \n an opportunity for gathering intelligence \n a shining opportunity for venturesome British outfits \n any opportunity for me to stand out . . . \n All three constructions (opportunity to/of/for) can appear with a preceding definite or indefinite article.

Yet to is increasingly common after the noun (the opposite to what I expected), appearing in the ratio of about 1:5 of all instances in BNC data. \n As an adjective, opposite is usually followed by to, very occasionally by from: \n Opposite to S’s display was an even grander show. \n Opposite from the Butter Cross, the Town Hall is built above a piazza. \n The use of to after the adjective opposite is often felt to be redundant when it refers to spatial locations, and increasingly it’s left out, making a preposition of opposite: \n Directly opposite the stove is the icon corner . . . \n This use of opposite as a preposition is more common in British English than American, by its relative frequency in data from BNC and CCAE – but established in both."

In North America and Australia, the latter role is that of the optometrist, and optician refers only to the dispenser of optical items. Ophthalmologist is used everywhere for the trained doctor who specializes in eyes – despite its challenging spelling and pronunciation (see further under ophthalmic or opthalmic).

		"title": "or",
		"explanation":"The conjunction or connects alternatives: seen or heard, right or wrong, confirm or deny. At bottom it’s a coordinator like and, and raises similar questions of agreement with coordinated subjects (see agreement section 4). Because or is used much more often in academic prose than in other kinds of writing, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research, there’s particular pressure to make the “correct” decision. As often, the issues are not simple, whether it’s the choice between: \n ∗ singular or plural verb \n ∗ first, second or third person of the verb, with a mix of pronouns \n ∗ masculine, feminine or neuter gender in the following pronoun \n 1 Singular or plural verb. When or coordinates two (or more) items/people as subject of the sentence, some style guides say that the verb should always agree in the singular. \n Perhaps the father or mother agrees to that. \n The advice seems to make sense when the alternatives are mutually exclusive. The Longman Grammar found that singular agreement was mostly used with or – provided the alternates were themselves singular, as in the previous example. When one or other (or both) was a plural, plural agreement was regularly used. For example \n The rustling of papers or chairs scraping were enough to disturb his concentration. \n Plural agreement was used, whether the plural item came first or second, so that notional rather than proximity agreement is apparently at stake. \n 2 Person of the verb (i.e. first, second or third) with or. After a mix of pronouns involving more than one person, the nearest one determines the choice of verb \n He or I do this every day. \n Are you or he responsible for this? \n They believe either you or I am responsible. \n In the first two examples the verb agrees with the person of the nearest pronoun,but it could equally be thought of as plural agreement with the notional pair of pronouns. The third example is less comfortable, because the verb be is involved, and the verb am agrees only with the nearest pronoun, and so proximity agreement is the only form achieved. If the plural verb are is used, it makes for notional agreement but is awkward in terms of proximity. Avoidance may be the best strategy in such cases, thus: \n They believe that I am responsible, or that you are. \n 3 Gender of the pronoun following or. When or connects male and female nouns or names, the gender of the nearer one could decide the issue, as in: \n Every boy or girl must cover her books with plastic film. \n The statement seems unfortunately sexist, as does the following – unless you have a very strong faith in generic his: \n Every boy or girl must cover his books with plastic film. \n In such cases the plural their provides notional agreement as well as a gender-free alternative: \n Every boy or girl must cover their books with plastic film. \n Those who still find that sentence grammatically anomalous would need to reword it. \n 4 Punctuation with or. This is simply a matter of whether to put a comma before or when it introduces the last of a series of alternatives. The issue is the same as for and in the same position. See the discussion of the serial comma under comma (section 3b). \n 5 Or as a correlative conjunction. Or often appears in tandem with either, and with neither: \n You can go on either Tuesday or Friday \n  Neither Tuesday or Friday is perfect for me. \n The choice between nor and or with neither, is discussed at nor or or. \n ♦ For the use of or in and/or, see and/or."

		"title": "-or/-our",
		"explanation":"These are alternative spellings for a sizable group of abstract nouns, such as colo(u)r, favo(u)r, hono(u)r, humo(u)r. They form a sharp divide between British and American spelling, whereas both are used in Canada and to some extent in Australia. The variation between -or and -our goes back to C17 and C18 uncertainties about how to relate these spellings to word origins. Scholars wanted to use -or for words received from Latin, and -our for the French loanwords. But in many cases it was unclear which language was the source, and the choice of ending became arbitrary. C18 dictionaries show a continuing trend toward -or for all of them, and this process was allowed to run its full course in the United States. In Britain it was halted by the publication of Dr. Johnson’s dictionary (1755), and, more importantly, the fact that the dictionary was reprinted with the spellings virtually unchanged for decades after his death. Johnson had a mixture of spellings for words in this group (compare anterior with posteriour), and his lack of conviction also emerges in the fact that the spellings in his correspondence didn’t always match up with those in his dictionary. Yet the words his dictionary has with -our are by and large the ones which British spelling preserves today. Fowler’s discomfort with them is evident in his Modern English Usage (1926), yet he seems to have been overruled by his publisher. American spellings with -or were recommended in Webster’s dictionaries from 1828 on. \n In Canada the field is divided. The Gage Canadian Dictionary (1983) recommended -or, but Canadian Oxford (1998) prefers -our. Canadian English Usage (1997) notes some regional differences, by which those working in eastern Canada (Ontario and Quebec) and in British Columbia are most likely to use -our, while those in the intervening prairie provinces generally use -or. The publishing medium also affects the issue, since most newspapers have -or where the major book publishers use -our. Australian usage has mostly followed the British in C20, though -or spellings appeared in various sources in C19, including regional newspapers and some legal codes. The -or spelling was adopted by the Australian Labor Party at the turn of the century (see under Labour). The -or spellings are more evident in some states than others especially Victoria and South Australia, where the major newspapers have continued to use it. Advertising copy often enshrines it in newspapers that use -our in the main text. \n The prime reason for preferring -or spellings is still exactly as Fowler suggested: they are more consistent with their common derivatives, for example: glamo(u)r glamorous glamorize \n  hono(u)r honorary honorific \n humo(u)r humorous humorist \n  labo(u)r laborious laboratory \n odo(u)r odorous deodorant \n vigo(u)r vigorous invigorate \n Those who use -or can simply maintain it in the derivative words, whereas -our-users have to remember to adjust their spelling habit. The occasional appearances of glamourous and humourist are a sign of the problem. This is why -or spellings seem both preferable and practical in all the basic words: \n arbor armor behavior clamor \n  color demeanor endeavor favor \n fervor flavor glamor harbor \n honor humor labor neighbor \n  odor parlor rancor rigor \n  rumor savior savor splendor \n  succor tumor valor vapor \n vigor \n The -or also applies to all English and French derivatives, including colorful, favorite, honorable, misdemeanor etc., as well as the latinate ones already illustrated. \n  International English selection: The -or spellings are to be preferred as a consistent pattern for both the basic words and their derivatives – an advantage that should not be sacrificed to regional loyalty. They have therefore been used throughout this book. The fact that -or spellings enjoy some use in Canada, Australia and elsewhere should work to dilute the regional divide. \n ♦ On the choice between -or and -er in agentive words such as protester, see -er/-or."

Cardinal is restricted to members of the privileged Sacred College, ranking next after the Pope. \n When it comes to numbers, the contrast is between ordinals and cardinals. The ordinals are the numbers which enumerate an order, i.e. first (1st), second (2nd), third (3rd); whereas the cardinals are the regular integers 1 (one), 2 (two), 3 (three), used to register how many there are in any set. \n ♦ For the choice between ordinals and cardinals in quoting the day of the month, see dates."

Yet the data on orient shows the same distribution: many figurative examples like the sports oriented motif, and a few physical ones like north–south oriented graves. The main point to note is that orient is roughly twice as frequent as orientate in this area of British usage.

		"title": "other than and otherwise",
		"explanation":"Other is historically an adjective meaning “second” or “alternative,” as in the other lady. Contemporary grammarians class it as a determiner and pronoun (see next entry), and it’s also on record as an adverb equivalent to otherwise. Modern dictionaries recognize other in all these roles, although its adverbial use especially in other than has been subject to controversy in Britain, following Fowler (1926). \n Many constructions with other than are uncontentious, when other is a (post-posed) adjective or determiner, as in: \n Kids need heroes other than rock stars. \n . . . arranged to take showers at places other than their homes \n These constructions often follow indefinite pronouns such as anything/anyone, something/someone, nothing/no one. In British English the idiom none other than is a very popular example: \n Inside was none other than the Queen. \n The adverbial use can be analogous to this, following an indefinite adverb: \n They might behave somehow other than arrogantly. \n Fowler’s objection was to sentences in which there was no preliminary adverb, for example: \n He refused to discuss it other than to curse.  \n . . . the wounded man, unidentified other than by his age . . . \n Though these examples may sound awkward to British ears, they are not so unusual in American English, which makes much more use of other than altogether, by the evidence of CCAE. British writers would probably want to substitute otherwise for other in the first of those examples, and apart from in the second. \n Otherwise raises similar issues. Though formed as an adverb (see -wise) it can take on other grammatical roles, especially in the combination or otherwise (or and otherwise). In shoot or otherwise put to death, it remains an adverb. But in sincere or otherwise it’s effectively an adjective, and in innocuousness or otherwise it takes on the role of a noun. All these are standard usage in both British and American English. \n Or otherwise can go further still, to substitute for a whole phrase or clause, as in: \n They may have succeeded or otherwise (i.e. not succeeded) \n This type of sentence is somewhat elliptical, yet not ungrammatical, as Fowler argued. As a tag, or otherwise communicates its meaning well enough. It may be off-handed, but not redundant since it hints at other possible outcomes. Or otherwise may nevertheless be partly redundant when used after whether. \n They need to know whether the cheque has arrived or otherwise. \n In this case the alternatives are implied in whether, and or otherwise adds nothing of substance. The phrase can also be partly redundant when used to conjoin clauses: \n We need to arrive by midnight, or otherwise the hotel will be shut. \n In such a sentence, otherwise, or just or, would be sufficient. \n Apart from these latter examples, constructions with or otherwise and other than serve their purpose, and are idiomatic and standard in both British and American English. Their grammar is a good deal more flexible than Fowler dreamed of."

		"explanation":"The pronoun other behaves rather like a noun, in that it can be made plural with s, and possessive (singular with ’s, plural with plain ’). These options come to a head in sentences like the following: where should the apostrophe be put in them? \n The group read each others letters. \n They took one anothers hand. \n Either other’s, others’ or each others could be defended. In the first there are multiple participants in “the group,” despite the singularity of “each”; and the second expresses mutual action, though “one” is resolutely singular. Style guides take their cue from each to argue that the singular possessive form (other’s) is the only one possible. But this seems a little awkward when the noun following is plural (letters) and the wording implies more than a single exchange. In the second sentence either form again seems possible: other’s because of the singular “hand,” or others’ because of the mutuality inherent in the action. The formal grammar of words and the notional grammar of the underlying semantics are at loggerheads. \n ♦ For the alleged distinction between each other and one another, see each other."

		"title": "ought",
		"explanation":"This word is a lone wolf in English grammar – an estranged relative of the verb owe. The chief function of ought nowadays is as a marginal modal verb, a substitute for should or must (see auxiliaries section 3, and modality). Its place in English is shrinking, and corpus data used for the Longman Grammar (1999) shows that its place is strongly challenged by should and must, as well as have to in conversation. Most examples of ought were found in British fictional discourse, and though they “accentuate the positive,” they highlight the uncertainties about its use in negative constructions and in questions. Older usage phrased them as follows: \n You oughtn’t to work so late. \n Ought he to know about it? \n In these examples ought is construed rather like a modal, taking the negative particle upon itself in the first, and framing the question without any support from the verb do in the second. When ought is construed as an ordinary verb, the negative sentence would be rephrased as: \n You didn’t ought to work so late. \n Burchfield (1996) regards it as a relatively recent construction, associated with “sparsely educated speakers,” though it may well go back to the roots of ought in the lexical verb “owe.” The Longman Grammar notes that contemporary speakers often bypass the problem by putting ought into a subordinate clause: \n I don’t think you ought to work so late. \n This shifts the negation into the higher clause, and ought works straightforwardly in the affirmative. If negative statements using do with ought are difficult, interrogative constructions sound unusable: Didn’t he ought to know?? \n Ought seems to have reached the end of an evolutionary phase in which it might have become a fully fledged modal. But the trappings of its older identity as a lexical verb have hung around – in the fact that to is almost always there to link it with the following verb, and in the use of do support in negative statements. So while ought still works affirmatively as a marginal modal expressing obligation, it’s otherwise replaced by modals such as should and must in nonfiction writing of all kinds, everywhere in the world."

		"title": "-ous",
		"explanation":"Many English adjectives end in -ous, meaning “full of ” or “similar to.” The ending came into English with French loanwords such as courageous, dangerous, glorious, virtuous, and has since been used to create new adjectives out of English nouns, of which the following are only a few: \n glamorous hazardous \n momentous murderous \n poisonous \n Many such adjectives are formed simply by adding -ous, though some modify the stem slightly, by telescoping a letter as in wondrous, or respelling the final consonant as in prodigious. (See -er>-r and -y>-i-.) In a few cases, the adjective in -ous parallels a noun ending in -ion or -ity: \n cautious caution \n capacious capacity \n (See -ious for other examples.) The -ous corresponds to latinate adjectives ending in -ose, and there are a few parallel formations (see -ose). \n Some adjectives ending in -ous contrast with a semantically related noun ending in -us, especially scientific pairs of words such as: \n adjective: fungous humous mucous (o)estrous phosphorous \n noun:  fungus  humus  mucus  (o)estrus  phosphorus \n In fact the noun/adjective distinction is not systematically observed, partly because the nouns are all much more common. The adjective fungous makes no showing in CCAE or the BNC, nor does humous – except as an alternative spelling for the Arabic dish hummus (see hummus). Only for mucous are there enough examples in both databases to show understanding of the contrast with mucus, although the data also have mucous occasionally used as a noun (full of mucous). Phosphorous too is used as a noun (at least in nontechnical writing), as in It gives the algae nitrogen and phosphorous. Half the examples in the BNC and almost all in CCAE used phosphorous where phosphorus might have been expected. Meanwhile the nouns are often used attributively, as in (o)estrus cycle, mucus membrane, phosphorus bomb, and are taking on the categorial role of adjectives (see adjectives introduction). Citrus never gives way to citrous in phrases like citrus trees (see citrus). There is thus little for the -ous adjectives to do. \n Note that in the case of callous/callus, the adjective and noun have moved apart. See further under callous."

Americans are much more likely to use the curtailed form with just out, especially in out the door and out the window. Why these two, both relating to apertures, should be treated differently is debatable. Yet the same ones are catching on in British English, and especially out the door, according to research by Estling (1997).

	{
		"title": "overlay or overlie",
		"explanation":"These two converge in many of their uses, by virtue of their meaning as well as their grammar. The idea of lying physically over and above is strong in overlie, so the word lends itself to scientific description: \n the clays which overlie the chalk \n coarse outer hairs which overlie the thick \n  insulating underfur \n The past tense of overlie is overlay, as in: \n The early road clearly overlay a burnt horizon. \n He spoke in a barely audible growl which overlay controlled anger. \n Its past participle is overlain: \n Organic-rich silt is overlain by glacial till. \n Overlay involves the affixing of a layer or special surface to an object, as in printing and other crafts: \n The area was concreted and overlaid with mosaic marble. \n  However the verb lends itself to figurative applications, as in: \n If we overlay the model that we came up with . . . Panama’s nationalism is more than usually overlaid with issues of race. \n Note that overlaid serves as past participle and as the simple past tense. \n Overlie and overlay come closer even than lie and lay because both are transitive (see lie or lay). While most geological examples in the BNC have overlie/overlain, there are some with overlay/overlaid, as in sediments have overlaid the older rocks. The verb overlie is given the meaning “smother by lying on,” yet the BNC has a village woman overlaid her baby last summer. In figurative uses the two are even harder to separate, and it becomes somewhat moot as to which it should be. One can certainly decide the issue by whether the layer or covering seems to be consciously applied, so you would then speak of the pessimism overlying a letter, and of fine words overlaying her suspicions. In those present participle forms, the two verbs contrast most clearly. But the other forms are too close for comfort, and crossover (mostly from overlie to overlay) is the result. It probably reflects the general impact of lay on lie. Be that as it may, the verb overlay is taking on most of the fresh figurative applications in BNC data, and looks likely to eclipse the other, sooner or later."

		"title": "overlook, oversee and oversight",
		"explanation":"The first two words are established verbs, with quite different meanings. Oversee means “supervise” or “manage,” as in: \n He was appointed to oversee the building of the factory. \n Overlook can mean quite literally “look over,” as in: \n Their window overlooked the garden. \n More often it’s used in the abstract sense “fail to take into account” as in: \n They overlooked the need to check the tides. \n Oversight provides an abstract noun for that second meaning of overlook, as in: \n By an oversight we did not send the collateral agreement along with the publishing agreement. \n In bureaucratic management, oversight is also the noun corresponding to oversee: \n He is responsible for the oversight and declaration of expenses. \n Local authority social service departments have oversight of all who need domiciliary care. \n The phrase have oversight is sometimes compacted into a simple verb,as in:  \n The department will oversight the domiciliary care program . . . \n This newish use of oversight as a verb is also associated with the bureaucracy, in British examples in the BNC, and some from Australia (Peters, 1995). American examples provided by Garner (1998) come from corporation-speak. Dictionaries in the northern hemisphere have yet to recognize oversight as a verb, and are perhaps reluctant because of stylistic objections to it. Still it exists by transfer (from noun to verb class) like many an English verb (see transfers). Its connotations of higher authority and responsibility make it distinct from the verb oversee."

It has steadily gained ground in the UK, by the note in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and by its use in everyday writing in almost 150 BNC texts. It occurs in various kinds of analysis, whether focused on: \n  the demise of the overly modest bathing costume \n  or \n not being overly concerned about the future \n Despite suggestions that overly is an unnecessary word – which could be replaced by “too” or “excessively” – it fills the niche between them in terms of bulk. Overly is equally useful in noun and verb phrases, as shown in those examples, whereas “too” is awkward in the noun phrase, and “excessively” rather an overkill in either. One other alternative is to use the adverbial prefix over-, creating compounds such as overmodest, overconcerned, though this works better with the second type (adjective / past participle) than the first (a simple adjective).

Yet often there’s little to choose between them, when applied to the special effect or characteristics of a piece of communication. Should it be overtones of arrogance or undertones of arrogance? \n Various distinctions have been proposed. Fowler argued that overtones were the implications of words, on the analogy of musical overtones which are the higher notes produced by a vibrating string above the note actually struck. Undertones are explained in terms of an undercurrent, something embedded in an utterance and inferrable from it. This would allow us to draw a distinction between the pervasive quality of a text (its undertone), and the more explicit overtones of words and phrases in it. How useful and usable such a distinction would be in a given case is another question. Sheer frequency suggests that overtone(s) is the more useful of the two, with more than twice as many instances in the BNC, in comparison with undertone(s)."

		"title": "oxymoron",
		"explanation":"When words incongruous or opposite in meaning are combined in the same phrase, they form an oxymoron, a paradoxical figure of speech (see further under that heading). Everyday examples are the aphorism Hasten slowly and the clich´e thunderous silence. An American example is the word sophomore (“a second-year student”), which is explained by Webster’s Third (1986) as meaning “wise-foolish.” The band Limp Bizkit makes the most of the oxymoronic effect, whatever the quality of its music. \n Like other Greek loanwords ending in -on, oxymoron has a plural in oxymora (see -on) as well as an English oxymorons. The silence of New Oxford (1998) on this issue argues for consent to the English plural, whereas Merriam-Webster (2000) specifically mentions oxymora. Yet there are no examples of oxymora in American data from CCAE, and almost a score of oxymorons – suggesting that this is the de facto plural for most writers. \n The term oxymoron is sometimes stretched in reference to ad hoc and unthinking juxtapositions of words which create a contradiction in terms. For example: \n It’s been a night of near misses as far as direct hits are concerned. \n Examples like these do not meet the essential syntactic criterion of being within the same phrase (noun or verb), nor do they create any “epigrammatic effect,” as Webster’s defines it. But perhaps they constitute “oxymoronism” – the word coined in 1992 by Australian columnist and playwright Alex Buzo."

		"title": "-p/-pp-",
		"explanation":"Words ending in -p generally conform to the common English spelling rules when suffixes are added (inflectional or derivational: see suffixes). Monosyllables with a simple vowel double the p, witness: \n clapping flipper floppy stepped \n Words of more than one syllable, including an unstressed one before the -p, do not double it: \n chirruped developer enveloped \n galloping gossipy scalloped \n walloping \n All these are perfectly regular, throughout the English-speaking world (see doubling of final consonant). But the pattern begins to fray at the edges with verbs whose second element coincides with a simple monosyllable. Hiccup is regular in American English, while in British its inflected forms may have either one or two ps: hiccuped or hiccupped (see hiccup). Kidnap and worship may be spelled either way in the US, although in the UK and Australia they always have two (see kidnapped or kidnaped, and worshipped or worshiped). Canadians live with both spellings in each case. Double p is in fact the standard spelling everywhere for words such as handicapped, horsewhipped, sideslipped, workshopped, and for ad hoc creations such as fellowshipped and membershipped. Since the ordinary meaning of ship is irrelevant to the verbs fellowship, membership and worship, doubling the p seems doubly unfortunate (see -ship). By the same token, the double p in horsewhipped, sideslipped, workshopped etc. probably helps to identify them as compounds. It raises the broader question as to whether spelling conventions are there to represent the sequences of sounds or the internal structure of words.

But the same four letters can represent a slightly cryptic Latin loanword with two syllables and several pronunciations, including “pacy,” “pah-chay” and “pah-kay.” Pace is the ablative form of the more familiar Latin word pax (“peace”), so literally it means “with peace.” More idiomatically it means “with the permission or pardon [of]” or “with apologies [to]” whoever is named immediately after. It offers a respectful apology for going against whatever the person named has said on the subject being discussed. Its proper use is shown in the following: \n An Australian alliance with the USA need not, pace Prime Minister Holt, mean “going all the way.” \n As the example shows, pace is used with the name of a person (or their title) immediately following. It expresses polite disagreement with some notable statement or opinion expressed by that person. Note that it’s not a referencing device like vide, or an alternative to e.g. for introducing an example. Pace may be set in italics as Webster’s English Usage (1989) recommends, although with a name or title always following, it’s unlikely to be mistaken or misread. \n ♦ For a different use of the same word, in requiescat in pace, see RIP."

Those concerned with the making of books may also use page to refer to the individual leaf. Dictionaries all confirm this additional sense of page – and the potential for confusion between the senses. \n This pales into insignificance beside the use of page on the internet, where it refers to quite variable lengths of text. It can be used for the rather small amount of text displayed on the computer screen at any one time, which varies with the browser, and changes as you scroll forward and backward. More technically, page refers to a whole hypertext document, whatever its length and structure, or to indexed sections of it. Their identity as webpages depends on being individually indexed with their own metadata, for searching by internet browsers (see metadata). \n Hypertext documents always begin with a homepage, the screenful that greets the eyes at the start of a visit to any website.

Major cultural differences, and sheer geographical separation prevented any real unification between the two, and, after years of civil war, the two formally separated in 1971.

The spelling with the ae digraph has prevailed in the UK, and in Australia, while plain e is standard in the US and Canada. The general arguments for simplifying it to e are set out at ae/e. The particular ones in this case are that the ae puts too much weight on an unstressed syllable, and makes a monstrous string of vowels – with which a hyphen is mandatory when the following stem begins with e, as in palaeo-ecology etc. Though the sequence looks less cumbersome with the ae printed as a ligature, the facilities to print ligatures are denied to most of us. The pronunciation of paleois more accurately represented without the a in the second syllable, and the word is perfectly recognizable without it.

		"title": "palette, pallette, pallet or palate",
		"explanation":"The first three words derive from a diminutive of the Latin word pala (“spade”). That flat shape becomes the palette on which artists mix their colors, and as pallette it was the name for a particular plate of metal in the armpit of a medieval suit of armor. With the spelling trimmed to pallet, it was the name of a tool used by the potter to smooth the clay being worked on the wheel. In modern industries, pallet is applied to the movable wooden platform on which goods are stored before transportation. \n  But the spelling pallet also represents an unrelated word for a mattress of straw, derived from the French word for straw: paille. And palate (“roof of mouth”), which is pronounced in exactly the same way as all of the above, is also unrelated, derived from Latin palatum. \n Apart from their likeness in sound, palette and palate can almost overlap in meaning when each is figuratively extended. The image of the artist’s palette is sometimes extended to mean “range of colors,” while palate is quite often a substitute for “taste,” based on the old idea that the taste buds were in the roof of the mouth.

But the three aspects fall together in comments like I was scared but not panicked. The passive construction (be panicked) is increasingly used to describe a heightened level of anxiety rather than fear of death – more often in the US than the UK, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. Yet American and British writers both use panicked into, to describe acting under pressures which are scarcely matters of life or death. For example: \n My mother was panicked into retiring. \n We should not be panicked into top-down solutions. \n As a passive adjective, panicked covers the range from fear of death (a horde of panicked civilians) to loss of income (panicked investors) to the social faux pas requiring a panicked phone call.

Fresh uses of it are mostly found in English scholarly words such as: \n par(a)esthesia paralanguage paramnesia \n paraplegic parapsychology parataxis \n Note that before a word beginning with a, the prefix becomes just par-. \n The second prefix involving the letters para- comes to us through French loanwords such as parachute and parasol. They embody an Italian prefix meaning “against,” a development of the Latin imperative para – literally “be prepared.” \n Parachute is itself the source of the third meaning for para-, found in recent formations such as the following: \n parabrake paradropper \n paraglider paratrooper \n All such words imply the use of the parachute in their operation. \n Paramedic may involve either the first or the third use of para-. When referring to the medical personnel who provide auxiliary services besides those of doctors and nurses, it belongs with the first set of scholarly words above. But when it’s a doctor or medical orderly in the US armed forces, who parachutes in to wherever help is needed, the word is clearly one of the third group."

		"title": "parable",
		"explanation":"A parable uses a simple story to teach a moral truth. The word has strong biblical associations, as the word applied in New Testament Greek to the didactic stories of Jesus Christ. But the definition applies equally to Aesop’s fables. A parable differs from an allegory in that the latter is concerned with more than a single issue, and often involves systematic linking of the characters and events with actual history. See further under allegory."

		"title": "paradigm",
		"explanation":"This word is widely used to mean “model,” though its older use is as a “model of thinking,” an abstract pattern of ideas endorsed by particular societies or groups within them. The term has been applied to the medieval assumption that the sun revolved around the earth, which has now been replaced by the opposite cosmological paradigm – that the earth revolves around the sun. Sociologists use the phrase dominant paradigm to refer to a system of social values which seems to set the pace for everyone. Rebels try to expose it with the slogan Subvert the dominant paradigm. \n Paradigm is also a synonym for the word “model” in a different sense, that of “exemplar,” used in many kinds of prose from the religious to the secular, for people and institutions: \n Christ, the paradigm of perfect humanity . . . \n the paradigm for the village school \n He was hardly the paradigm of the bookish politician. \n Japan is many people’s paradigm of how finance should serve industry. \n This use of the word makes a tautology of the phrase paradigm case, as some have argued. It is nevertheless fully recognized in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). \n The word paradigm has long been used in grammars to refer to the set of different word forms used in the declension or conjugation of a particular word. The often-quoted paradigm for the present tense of the Latin verb amare (“love”) is: \n amo “I love” \n amas “you love” (singular) \n amat “he/she/it loves” \n amamus “we love” \n amatis “you love” (plural) \n amant “they love” \n For a given context you select the form of the word you need. This idea of selecting one out of a vertical set of options has been extended in modern linguistics to refer to the alternative words or phrases which might be selected at a given point in a sentence. See for example the various paradigms in: \n Several new staff begin on Monday. \n A few employees commence next Monday. \n A number of assistants start next week. \n The use of paradigm in this last sense is the basis on which linguists speak of the paradigmatic axis of language, as opposed to its syntagmatic axis. For more about the latter, see under syntax."

In fact there’s a confusion of choice: \n paradisiac paradisaic paradisic \n paradisiacal paradisaical paradisical \n paradisial paradisal paradisian \n paradisean \n Though the major dictionaries give separate entries to several of these, their crossreferencing shows which is preferred: New Oxford (1998) makes it paradisal and Merriam-Webster (2000) paradisiacal. This accords well with corpus data for British and American English respectively. For writers in the BNC it’s clear that shorter is better, and paradisal outnumbers its nearest rival (paradisiacal) by 3:1. American writers are more pluralistic, but the majority prefer paradisiacal, by the evidence of CCAE."

		"title": "paragraphs",
		"explanation":"For those who cast a casual eye down the page, paragraphs are just the visual units that divide up a piece of writing. Paragraph breaks promise relief from being continuously bombarded with information. The start of each paragraph is still marked by an indent in most kinds of writing and (print) publishing. But in business letters and electronic publishing the trend is to set even the first line of each paragraph out at the left hand margin (= “blocked format”).  \n For the reader, paragraphs should correlate with units of thought or action in the writing. They should provide digestible blocks of information or narrative, by which the reader can cumulatively absorb the whole. Ideally (at least in informative and argumentative writing) the paragraph begins with a topic sentence, which signals in general terms whatever it will focus on. The following paragraph shows the relationship between topic sentence and the rest: \n In Sydney it’s commonly said – and perhaps believed – that Melbourne is the wetter place. The facts are quite different. Sydney’s rainfall in an average year is almost twice that of Melbourne, and in a bad year, a lot more. Suburban flooding is a much more frequent problem in Sydney than in Melbourne . . . \n The first sentence says what the paragraph is about, the notion that Melbourne is a wetter place (than Sydney). Note that the second brief sentence in fact combines with it to show what the paragraph is intended to do, and also works as a kind of topic sentence. Following the statement of the topic, there are specific points to back it up, and so a paragraph forms a tightly knit unit around a particular idea. \n Readers (especially busy ones) appreciate having topic sentences that flag the point or content of each paragraph, and thus outline the structure of the argument. \n  How long should paragraphs be? What is considered normal in length varies with the context. Many newspapers use one-sentence paragraphs in their ordinary reporting – presumably because they are conscious of the visual effect of longer ones, and are less concerned about giving their readers information in significant units. In scholarly writing and in institutional reports, paragraphs are often quite long – as if shorter ones might imply only cursory attention to an issue. For general purposes, paragraphs from three to eight sentences long are a suitable size for developing discussion, and some publishers recommend an upper limit of five or six sentences. Paragraphs which threaten to last the whole page certainly need scrutiny, to see whether the focus has actually shifted and a new paragraph is needed. \n 2 Continuity of paragraphs. Paragraphs need to be in an appropriate order for developing the subject matter. The connections between them can then be made unobtrusively – often embedded in the topic sentence. In the following example, a small but sufficient link with what’s gone before is provided by means of the word different: \n A different approach to marketing fiction paperbacks might be to develop automatic vending machines for them, to be installed at railway stations, bus terminals and airports . . . \n The word “different” reminds readers that at least one other “approach” has already been discussed, and cues them to expect a contrasting strategy now. It thus achieves two kinds of cohesion with what went before. For a range of other cohesive devices, see under coherence or cohesion, and conjunctions. \n Writing guides sometimes advocate including a cohesive or transitional device at the end of each paragraph, as well as at the beginning of the next. This becomes very tedious if done over every paragraph break – and is not necessary if there’s adequate cohesion at the start of new paragraphs with what has gone before."

It is the only spelling in data from the BNC and CCAE, and foregrounded in New Oxford (1997), Merriam-Webster (2000), the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie (1997). \n The spelling parrakeet preferred by Webster’s Third (1986) would underscore the word’s connections with parrot and French perroquet. Other possibilities however are the Spanish periquito, or Italian parochetto. Both French and Spanish explanations make par(r)akeet a diminutive of the name Peter (French Pierre, Spanish Pedro).

		"title": "parallel constructions",
		"explanation":"Presenting comparable or contrasting thoughts in a parallel construction is an effective way of drawing attention to their similarities and differences. Many ordinary observations become memorable sayings or aphorisms with the help of parallelism: \n Least said soonest mended. \n Run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. \n Identical grammatical structures bind together the two contrasting parts of these sayings, with telling effect. \n Any writer can create parallel constructions to draw attention to ideas which complement or contrast with each other. See for example: \n The traveller doesn’t need to go outside Australasia for sightseeing, or to see the best, get the best or do the best this planet affords . . .(G. D. Meudell) \n Whatever the validity of the view, it gains rhetorical force from the three parallel points, grammatically matched so that all can be read in connection with the final clause. \n Parallel constructions do have to be exactly matched. Sentences whose grammar nearly matches – but not quite – make difficult reading: \n The speaker was not able to hold their attention, nor his jokes to amuse them. \n In that example of faulty parallelism, the use of correlative not–nor cannot make up of the lack of a plural verb in the second statement (it cannot be borrowed or “read” from the first statement). The benefits of parallelism are easily compromised by noncorrespondence of the two parts, and the result is stylistically worse than if there had been no hint of parallelism at all. But with some simple changes, the parallelism is secure: \n The speaker was unable to hold their attention, or to amuse them with his jokes. \n Correlatives such as not–nor, neither–nor can be used to create parallel constructions in the negative. Positive sets can be phrased with either–or when the points are alternatives; and with not only – but also or both – and when one point is added to another. See further under individual headings."

		"title": "paraphrase",
		"explanation":"A paraphrase finds an alternative way of saying something. Dr. Samuel Johnson demonstrated the art of it when, according to Boswell, he first commented that a contemporary drama “has not wit enough to keep it sweet,” and immediately afterwards turned it into: \n o: It has not vitality enough to preserve it from putrefaction. \n In that famous case, the paraphrase has also effected a style change, from plain Anglo-Saxon language to rather formal latinate language. The stylistic change could of course go in the opposite direction – further down the scale of informality: \n Not enough spark to keep it lively. \n People use paraphrases for any of a number of reasons. A style may need adapting to communicate with a different audience from the one originally addressed. So a technical document may need extensive paraphrasing for the lay reader. A piece which is written for silent reading may need to be revised for a listening audience. \n Paraphrase works best with whole phrases and ideas, not by finding new words for particular slots in the old sentence. (The example quoted from Johnson above is rather limited in this respect.) By totally recasting the sentence you can achieve a more consistent style, and more idiomatic English."

A pair of dashes would also have served the purpose. Paired commas are sometimes used but are not ideal: they imply a closer interrelationship between parenthesis and the host sentence than there actually is. For other punctuation associated with parentheses, see brackets section 2. \n Because a parenthesis interrupts the reading of the host sentence, it should not be too long, nor introduce tangential material which could and should be kept for its own sentence.

It usually keeps the form and style of the original work, or the genre to which it belongs, applying them to rather different subject matter. Its purpose may be to debunk the original, or to express a fresh comment through it. In the example below, Dorothea Mackellar’s passionate poem about the Australian landscape is reworked as a satirical commentary on suburban development. Mackellar’s original version appears on the left, and the parody by Oscar Krahnvohl on the right: \n I love a sunburnt country I love a sunburnt country \n A land of sweeping plains A land of open drains \n Of rugged mountain ranges Mid-urban sprawl  expanded \n Of droughts and flooding rains For cost-accounting gains \n I love her far horizons Broad, busy bulldozed acres \n I love her jewelled sea Once wastes of ferns and trees \n Her beauty and her terror Now rapidly enriching \n The wide brown land for me Investors overseas. \n Taken on its own, Krahnvohl’s verse is a vigorous satire of urban expansion at the expense of environment and community. Taken alongside Mackellar’s original, it gathers extra emotional force, pointing up the betrayal of those who delight in the natural landscape. As often, the parody highlights contrasting value systems."

In older usage parricide could also mean the killing of one’s ruler (thought of as a father figure) as well as the crime of treason against one’s country; see Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986). This wider range of uses would explain why parricide is more common in BNC data than patricide and matricide put together. \n Yet American writers are less inclined to use parricide, by the evidence of CCAE, where patricide outnumbers parricide by almost 2:1. Since matricide is also in use, this suggests that Americans prefer the more specific terms. Patricide is of course more transparent than parricide, because of the root (Latin pater, “father”) that it shares with patriarch, patrimony etc. Parricide meanwhile is isolated, probably based on the same root as parent, but visually disguised by the double r. In Latin the word was often spelled with just a single r, and in Roman law par(r)icidium included the killing of either father or mother."

		"title": "participles",

The present ends in -ing, and the past in -ed for regular verbs, but with -en or -n or a change of stem vowel for others (see irregular verbs). The following show the various forms: \n  ∗ present: rolling taking blowing ringing \n ∗ past: rolled taken blown rung \n The names present and past are misnomers, since either participle can occur in what is technically a present or past tense. In we were rolling, the present participle combines to form the past continuous tense, and in we have rolled the past participle contributes to the present perfect. \n What the participles really do in English is create different aspects for the verb, either imperfect (also known as continuous or durative) or perfect i.e. completed (see further under aspect). The participles also contribute to the active/passive distinction, in that the present participle is always active, and the past one is normally passive (see further under voice). The two kinds of participle are frequently used as adjectives in English, as in a rolling stone and a rolled cigarette. Each type is also capable of introducing a nonfinite clause, witness their role in the following sentences: \n Rolling towards them, the tyre loomed larger every second. \n She found the papers rolled up in a cardboard tube. \n See further under nonfinite clause. \n The -ing ending of the present participle makes it identical with the English verbal noun, though they have separate origins. The coincidence between them in some constructions has fueled grammatical controversy for more than two centuries. See further under gerund and gerundive."

Both are adverbs meaning “in part,” and can substitute for each other as subjuncts and downtoners, as in a partly/partially demolished building. (See further under hedge words.) Partially is in other ways more limited, used mostly to modify verbs or verbal derivatives (as in the previous example), but sometimes adjectives and other adverbs, as in: \n Efforts to reduce residues in pork products had been partially successful. \n Partly is more versatile, able to replace partially in all those roles, and to modify whole phrases, witness: \n It was partly their responsibility. \n This he did with difficulty, partly on account of his bad eyesight. \n Examples like this show partly functioning as a disjunct, in addition to its roles as subjunct. (See further under adverbs section 1.) \n Note also that partially is stylistically somewhat formal, as Webster’s English Usage (1989) comments. This, plus the wider range of uses for partly, give it much greater currency than partially – at least in British English.

Business and personal relationships are intertwined in the tantalizing advertisement for sophisticated conference accommodation: \n WHAT WILL YOU DO WHILE YOUR PARTNER IS MEETING HIS PARTNER? \n  Partner covers a variety of live-in relationships, as in the following comment: \n If you’re an experienced homicide investigator and the woman turns up dead, until you cross him off the list, the partner, be it a boyfriend, a former husband or husband, is always considered technically if not legally a suspect. \n Both married and unmarried relationships are thus covered by partner, and straight as well as gay ones. \n ♦ Compare spouse."

		"title": "parts of speech",
		"explanation":"This is the traditional term for what are now usually called word classes. Either way they are the eight groups by which words may be categorized, according to their roles in sentences: \n nouns adjectives verbs \n pronouns prepositions conjunctions \n interjections adverbs \n These grammatical classes have long been the basis of dictionary classifications of words, with the addition of articles (definite and indefinite). \n Modern English grammars such as the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) and the Longman Grammar (1999) have updated the parts of speech in several ways. They use the broader class of determiner to include both articles and certain kinds of adjectives (see determiners). Numerals also function as determiners, but are made a separate class because their other role is like that of noun or pronoun at the head of a noun phrase. There are separate classes for three types of verb (primary, modal, full or lexical), because of their distinctive roles in syntax (see further under auxiliary verbs). Both the grammars mentioned would expand the class of interjections, so as to include a wider range of lexical items like “yes,” “cheers,” as well as nonlexical noises such as “hmm” and “uhhuh,” which are important in spoken interaction. The Longman Grammar rechristens the class as “inserts,” to escape the constraints of the term interjection (see interjections). Grammarians and linguists also draw attention to the divide between two broad classes of words: the “closed” and “open” sets. The first set consists of classes whose membership is relatively fixed: determiners, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliary verbs. The second includes nouns, adjectives, adverbs, full/lexical verbs, whose membership is open-ended and continually being expanded. The “closed”/“open” distinction correlates with that of function words versus content words (see under words). \n The English language challenges the traditional parts of speech in other ways as well. Words can clearly belong to more than one class, for example down, which can be a noun, adjective, verb, adverb or preposition, depending on the verbal context. It proves more useful to think of word classes as representing the set of grammatical functions which a word may take on, rather than pigeon-holes for classifying words. In Latin and Greek, most words had a single function and could be seen as belonging to a particular class; whereas in English their classification varies with their function. It makes less sense to say that English words “belong” to particular classes. But the functions of English word classes can still be discussed under the familiar headings of noun, verb etc.; and it’s still conventional to talk of words being converted or transferred from one class to another when they take on new grammatical roles. In fact this usually means an additional rather than a substitute role. See further under transfers."

Examples such as parvenu bureaucrats and the parvenu heroine of the play from the BNC and CCAE show this in attributive use, as do nonhuman applications such as the parvenu art of photography.

Passim is however justifiable when referring to a key word which recurs many times on successive pages; or else to an idea whose expression is diffused through the discussion and not in any fixed verbal form. \n As a foreign word and/or as a referencing device, passim may be set in italics rather than roman.

	{
		"title": "passive verbs",
		"explanation":"People seem to polarize over passives; they’re either addicted to them or inclined to crusade against them. But passive verbs serve some legitimate ends in grammar and style, and their use can be moderated accordingly. \n 1 The grammar of the passive. A passive verb is one in which the subject undergoes the process or action expressed in the verb, as in: \n Several candidates were included on the short list. \n Only two have been called for an interview. \n As the examples show, passive verbs consist of (a) a part of the verb be and (b) a past participle. Between them they ensure that the subject is acted upon, and thus a passive rather than active participant in whatever is going on. Passive constructions emphasize the process, rather than who is performing the action, and so are called agentless passives. It is possible to express the agent of a passive verb, but only as a phrase after it: \n Only two have been called by the secretary for an interview. \n Even in this form, the passive seems to downplay the agent, not allowing it to take up the more prominent position at the start of the sentence (see further under information focus). \n 2 Style and the passive. Because passive verbs play down the agent (or make it invisible), they are not the stuff of lively narrative when you want to know who is doing what. Used too often, as in some academic and official styles, they make for dreary reading. Yet for institutional communication they’re all too useful. In their agentless form (without the by phrase) they avoid saying who is controlling and managing the situation – which is a distinct advantage if you have to break the news that terminations are on the horizon: \n The employment of staff with less than six months service will be terminated. \n Such wording is less confrontational and perhaps more tactful than: \n We, the senior management, will terminate the employment of staff with less than six months service. \n The second version with an active verb puts a glaring spotlight on the people who have to do the dirty deed. Active verbs must have their agents expressed as the subject: see further under that heading. \n ♦ For the use of the double passive in American court reporting, see under ordered. \n 3 The passive in scientific prose. Apart from its use in official and corporate documents, the passive is a regular component of some kinds of science writing. Scientific reports are intended to provide objective description of experimental procedures, in terms of processes rather than people. The agentless passive allows the scientist to report that: \n The mixture was heated to 300 ◦ C without saying who actually did it. Who did it is irrelevant (or should be) as far as the scientific process goes. The passive also allows scientists to avoid implying any particular cause and effect in their statements, and to concentrate on what happened until they are ready to look for explanations in physical laws and principles. Not all science writers rely on the passive, and the pressures just discussed are probably stronger in chemistry than in biology. The Council of Biology Editors in the US has pushed for more direct, active reporting of scientific observations since the 1960s, encouraging their members to counter the ingrained habit of using passive verbs. Kirkman’s (1980) research into British science and engineering style also showed that less highly passivized writing was greatly preferred by the 2800 professionals surveyed: even reasonably well written texts in the “traditional” passive came a poor second to more direct, active writing. \n Final note. The passive construction is not a blanket necessity, despite its traditional use in some quarters. It does serve strategic purposes here and there; and it has a place in any writer’s repertoire as a resource for altering the focus of discourse and setting up a new topic at the beginning of a sentence. See further under topic."

		"explanation":"Most English verbs show whether the action they refer to happened in the past, rather than the present or some indefinite time in the future. This is the point of difference between: \n live/lived send/sent \n teach/taught write/wrote \n The past tense is often shown simply by the -(e)d suffix, as with lived and all regular verbs. Irregular verbs make the past tense in other ways, with changes to vowels and/or consonants of the stem, as illustrated by sent/taught/wrote. Just a handful of verbs (old ones ending in -t like hit and put) make no change at all from the present to the past tense (see under irregular verbs). \n Only the simple past tense is formed by those means. For compound past tenses, auxiliaries are combined with one or other participle, and they in fact mark the tense: \n was living (past continuous, progressive) \n had been teaching (past perfect continuous) \n had written (past perfect) \n All such compound tenses express aspect as well as tense (see further under aspect)."

		"title": "pasta, paste, pastry, pasty, pâté or patty",
		"explanation":"All these words for food go back to the Greek word for “barley porridge.” They are a tribute to the versatility of European cuisine, and all improve on the shapeless cereal of the original. \n In pasta the focus on cereal remains, yet this staple Italian food comes in myriads of shapes: cannelloni, macaroni, ravioli, spirelli, tortellini, vermicelli etc. The English word pastry embodies the same root, and with the -ry suffix transforms the cereal substance into the medium out of which shapely pies and pie crusts can be created. \n The traditional English pasty features both the pastry medium, and its meaty filling, whereas in paste and patˆ e´ the meaning has shifted away from the cereal to the prepared meat. Both paste and patˆ e´ are enjoyed in their own right, though we normally consume them with the help of other cereal items (bread or biscuits). \n The English word patty sustains both kinds of meaning. What we cook in patty pans is again a cereal item, a small pie, tart or cake; whereas the patties cooked in a frying pan are a savory item made out of minced meat. Pate´ is often written in English without its circumflex, though the final acute accent lingers to distinguish it from the English word pate (“head”), as in bald pate. Its origins are obscure, but it may owe something to the word paten, the shiny ceremonial dish used in celebrating the Mass."

		"title": "patella",
		"explanation":"This Latin loanword meaning a “shallow pan” has two plurals: the anglicized patellas and the pure Latin patellae. Archeologists who use the word in its Latin sense naturally prefer the Latin plural. But either plural may be used when the word means “kneecap,” depending on how specialized the readership is. In prose intended for anatomists, the Latin plural is more likely than the English – but vice versa when the discussion is intended for the general reader. See further under -a section 1."

Australian fruit-lovers sometimes distinguish between pawpaw (the larger orange-fleshed variety) and papaya (the smaller one with bright pink flesh). But papaya is the most common form of the word in Britain and elsewhere. \n Americans use papaya for the tropical fruit in all its shapes and colors, and reserve pa(w)paw for a native tree which is a member of the custard apple family.

		"title": "PC, p.c., pc or pc.",
		"explanation":"A miscellany of abbreviations converge on these two letters of the alphabet. The upper case abbreviation PC has long been used in Britain for “Police Constable” and “Privy Councillor,” as well as “Parish Council” and the “Parish Councillor.” In Canada it also refers to a “Progressive Conservative.” All these – now written without stops – coincide with PC as the generic “personal computer,” coined in the 1970s to distinguish it from the large mainframe computer. \n Lower case p.c. is primarily associated with “political correctness,” which appeared in the early 90s, shortly after the concept itself (see political correctness). In American and Canadian English, p.c. also abbreviates per cent and post cibum (“after meals,” used in pharmaceutical prescriptions). In British and Australian English, where stops in abbreviations are disappearing more quickly, pc can appear in these various applications without stops. \n The hybrid pc. is sometimes used as the abbreviation for “price” and “piece,” where the single stop shows that the full form is a single word. This is a nicety, but with or without stop, pc(.) is unlikely to be misunderstood in its typical context, attached to numerals in a catalogue."

Peaceful goes with nonhuman nouns, referring to situations, periods or general activities which are calm and free of disturbance, conflict and noise."

		"title": "peak, peek or pique",
		"explanation":"Because they sound alike, these verbs are sometimes mistaken for each other. The four letters of peak in fact represent two verbs, one of which (“become sickly”) is much less familiar than the other: “reach a climax,” as in the temperature peaked at 38 degrees. Peek is an informal verb meaning “take a quick or furtive look at,” as in peek out of the window, and by extension “poke out,” as in his toes peeked through the holes. Pique connects with both high and low emotional states. In piqued their interest it means “arouse”; and the reflexive pique oneself on means “pride oneself on.” But the passive was piqued about takes on the meaning of “disappointed, resentful,” which it shares with the noun pique (as in a fit of pique). \n So far so good, yet the identities of these words are less clear in figurative uses and derived forms. Should it be peaked or peeked in The morning sun peeked over La Costa? It would of course depend on whether you meant sunrise (peeked) or midday (peaked). Peaked in the sense of “off-color” is also potentially confusable with the negative sense of piqued (“disappointed”) in constructions such as “feeling peaked/piqued.” Again the writer’s choice impacts on the narrative. \n The adjective peaky does double service – at least in British English – for both verbs spelled peak, and so can mean “sickly” as well as “having peaks.” These two meanings are however distinguishable by the fact that the first meaning almost always collocates with either “look” or “feel”: you’re looking a bit peaky; whereas the second is often attributive, as in peaky swirls of cream on the cake."

		"title": "per",
		"explanation":"This Latin preposition, meaning “through, by,” has a number of uses in English, mostly as a member of stock Latin phrases which are detailed below. Per can also be combined with English words of the writer’s own choosing for various meanings. When used in recipes, as in 200 gm cheese per person, it means “for each,” and its meaning is similar in price lists: $25 per 100 units. In the phraseology of commercialese, to be delivered per courier means “by or through the agency of.” Some object to such expressions, especially when the English preposition by would do. Yet the meaning embedded in per person would be hard to express as neatly in other words. \n ∗ per annum means “by the year,” often used after quoting a salary: $48 500 per annum. In job advertisements it’s usually abbreviated as p.a. \n ∗ per capita means “by heads.” Its usual context is in economic writing, when statistics are being presented in terms of the individual: \n The per capita consumption of wine has increased dramatically over the last three years. \n ∗ per cent. See percent. \n ∗ per diem means “by the day,” typically used in calculating the daily cost of living away from home, apart from overnight accommodation itself. In English it also serves as a noun to refer to the allowance conceded by some institutions to traveling employees. \n ∗ per procurationem or p.p., as used in correspondence. See individual entry. \n ∗ per se means “by itself ” or “for its own sake.” It distinguishes the intrinsic value of something from its ramifications: \n  The discovery is of some importance per se, as well as for the directions it suggests for future industries. \n In everyday American English, per se is increasingly used to question the application of a word: \n This is not cleanup work per se. \n I really don’t have a feud per se with him. \n As in these examples, the word in question is usually preceded by a negative and followed by per se."

	},
	{
		"title": "per procurationem and p.p.",
		"explanation":"The former is the full form of a phrase we know better by the abbreviations per proc., per pro or just p.p. The full Latin phrase means “through the agency [of],” and when followed by capitalized initials it indicates who actually signed the letter, as opposed to the person in whose name it is sent. The usual convention is for p.p. and the proxy’s initials or signature to appear just above the typed signature of the official sender. \n An older convention reported by Fowler and others is for the proxy also to handwrite the official signatory’s name, either before the p.p. or after their own initials. So a letter going out for James Lombard might be signed in either of the following ways: \n J. Lombard pp R.S.M \n More common than either nowadays is the simple use of p.p. and the proxy’s initials. \n The older abbreviation per pro (without a stop) was taken by some users to be a combination of two Latin prepositions, and to mean “for and on behalf of.” In accordance with this interpretation, they would write it as per/pro. With decreasing knowledge of Latin in the community, this variant is disappearing."

		"title": "percent, per cent and %",
		"explanation":"All these serve to abbreviate per centum (“by the hundred”) – a pseudo-Latin phrase, probably based on Italian per cento, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). The abbreviation per cent saw a rapid rise from mid-C16, and it now stands in its own right without any full stop, and never in italics. Though traditionally written as two words, the standard American form is now percent – in principle, as indicated in the Chicago Manual (2003); and in practice, in regular use in data from CCAE. The Oxford Dictionary observes that percent as one word is “now frequent.” Yet per cent is firmly maintained in the British editorial tradition: the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) presents it as the only form, though percent occurs in up to 10% of all instances in BNC data. The Canadian Oxford (1998) recognizes both per cent and percent, as does the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). In Australian corpus data, percent appeared in about 20% of instances (Peters, 1995). The merged form shows the natural tendency for well-used Latin phrases: compare postscript and subp(o)ena. \n The numbers accompanying percent are normally printed as figures, i.e. 10 percent, according to the Chicago Manual (2003). In newspaper data from CCAE, figures are almost invariably used, for small or large percentages, i.e. whether below or above the general threshold for numbers as figures (see numbers and number style section 3). British newspaper data also show regular use of figures with per cent. But in other kinds of everyday writing in the BNC, figures and words appear about equally. Words are typically used for round numbers such as ten per cent, fifty percent, and also for non-round numbers that come at the start of a sentence: Twenty-eight percent were putting off-farm income into their farms. Either way, a space is left before percent / per cent. \n The percent sign % is now freely used in most kinds of nonfiction, including humanistic writing that contains many percentage figures (Chicago Manual, 2003). The Oxford Guide to Style notes also its use in statistical writing in the social sciences. The symbol is always set solid with the preceding number, as in 10%. When used in tables, the % sign need not be printed with every number in a column of percentages, but at the top of the column. Should the figures in the column add up to something other than exactly 100%, the total at the bottom should be left as 99.4% or 100.2%, not rounded off (Butcher, 1992). \n When used in continuous text, a percentage figure may take either a plural or singular verb in agreement, depending on what’s under discussion. Is it plural or a mass noun? The two patterns work as follows: \n Of the students who came, 10 percent were unprepared. \n In the end 10 percent of the wool was rejected."

	{
		"title": "percentage",
		"explanation":"This is the fully formed abstract noun for percent, meaning “proportion calculated in terms of a notional population of 100.” It lends itself to specifics such as a rise of two percentage points in interest rates or the high percentage of silicone in a waterproofing agent. As in these examples, percentage is normally quantified or qualified in some way, to pin its meaning down. The word otherwise can only mean “an unspecified proportion,” as in: \n A percentage of the school went to the races. \n Does that mean 95 percent or 10 percent? The statement begins to be useful with the addition of an adjective: \n A large/small percentage of the school went to the races. \n Percentage is also used figuratively to mean “advantage,” a sense derived from its use in specifying profit margins. For example: \n There’s no percentage in rushing back to the office. \n When used in this sense, percentage is often preceded by a negative (no, as in that case) or by indefinites, such as any or some. Such usage is still “informal,” according to New Oxford (1998) and the Canadian Oxford (1998), and “colloquial” for the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997), but Merriam-Webster (2000) registers it without demur."

		"explanation":"This remarkable tool allows us to know exactly what day of the week any date in the past or future might be. Both historians and astrologers are interested in what day of the week people are born on; and those making forward plans for celebrations may be interested in what day of the week Christmas Day will be in the year 2006 or 2010. \n The calendar was originally developed within the Christian church as an aid to knowing what days of the week the fixed saints’ days fell on, and how they related to Easter in a given year. It can be calculated from the date of the first Sunday in the year, which provides a dominical letter i.e. a “Sunday letter” for each year. If the first Sunday is actually January 1, the dominical letter for the year is A. If the first Sunday is January 2, the dominical letter is B; and so on, through to G. Put the other way round, we have a scheme for checking the rotation of days of the week against fixed dates. So: \n Dominical letter A January 1 =  Sunday \n           B              = Saturday \n             C              = Friday \n            D = Thursday \n            E              = Wednesday \n            F              = Tuesday \n            G              = Monday \n In leap years two dominical letters apply: one for January and February, and the second for March to December. The dominical letters, and their numerical equivalents, are shown in the table in Appendix III, along with a segment of the calendar for the years 1901 to 2008. \n ♦ For more about the development of the European calendar, see under dating systems."

		"title": "person",
		"explanation":"For grammarians, the concept of person separates the person speaking (first person), the one spoken to (second person), and the one spoken about (third person). These differences can be seen in the English personal pronouns: \n ∗ first person I (me, my, mine) we (us, our, ours) \n ∗ second person you (your, yours) \n ∗ third person he (him, his) she (her, hers) it (its) they (them,  their,  theirs) \n The only other point in English grammar where person makes a difference is in the present tense singular of most verbs. The third person has an -s suffix, while the first and second do not. Compare: I believe, you believe with s/he believes. However with the verb be, all three persons are different: am, are, is. \n  When the first person singular is used in the same phrase as one of the other two, politeness dictates that it comes second, as in he and I, you and I/me. The same applies when a noun (= third person) is mentioned with the first person, as in her mother and I. These conventions apply in standard written texts, although they may be relaxed in conversation (Wales, 1996). They also tend to be set aside when I is coupled with a bulky coordinate, as in I and other members of the Board. The first person plural pronoun we/us usually comes first (Strang, 1962), as in we and they, we and their parents. \n First- or third-person style. When writing, the choice of person has a pervasive effect on the style. The first person singular (I) engages readers closely in what’s being described, and provides or simulates direct experience of it. The first person plural (we) also tends to involve the reader, suggesting a kind of solidarity between writer and reader which can be played on when seeking to persuade. The third person tends to put distance between writer and reader, in both fiction and nonfiction. A third person narrative, written in terms of he/she/it/they, seems to set both writer and reader apart from whatever’s being described. Continuous use of the third person in nonfictional writing can seem very impersonal – which may or may not be the intention. See further under I."

		"explanation":"This has long been used as a gender-free combining-form in expressions for the numbers of people involved, as in: \n a two-person room \n a 50-person waiting list \n a 15 000-person retirement community \n In the quest for inclusive language, -person has also been used in some quarters as a way of avoiding the invidious choice between -man and -woman, when one wished to avoid preempting the sex of possible incumbents of a position. This is not a trivial matter in, say, selecting someone to chair a committee, where using either chairman or chairwoman may seem to preempt the issue. (See further under nonsexist language.) Several formations with -person are more or less current in most varieties of English, including: \n anchorperson businessperson chairperson \n layperson newsperson salesperson \n  spokesperson sportsperson tradesperson \n Of these, chairperson, salesperson and spokesperson are well established in both British and American English, and Americans use all the rest to some extent, by the evidence of CCAE. British use of businessperson, layperson, sportsperson, tradeperson shows up in BNC data, but not of anchorperson and newsperson (both media-oriented terms). \n The currency of these terms with -person goes against the view of Maggio (1988) that they were “a last resort.” They have proved more durable than expected, and the suffix is still clearly productive. The only inherent problem is if -person gets used more often to paraphrase words ending in -woman than ones ending in -man. People then tend to see -person as a thinly veiled substitute for the female term only, and it too acquires sexist connotations. An alternative strategy with job titles (where it matters most) is to use occupational and structural titles that highlight the role or occupation and make no reference to gender.

		"title": "persona",
		"explanation":"This Latin loanword has two plurals: the anglicized personas and the pure Latin personae. In British English personae is used much more than in American for the identities projected by authors in their writing, or the roles of public figures – by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE. Typical examples are: \n . . . the personae of Arthur Ransome, E Nesbit and Enid Blyton \n . . . one of the nation’s most trusted television personas \n In both American and British texts, the plural personae appears in fixed phrases borrowed from Latin, as one might expect: in personae non gratae (see next entry) or dramatis personae, the characters listed to appear in a play.

The phrase was originally used in English in its positive form persona grata, but the negative form is now the one most widely known and used, especially in nondiplomatic contexts.

The word personnel is used in companies and government departments as a collective noun for all those employed there. It may take either singular or plural verbs in agreement (see under collective nouns). \n Like many an English noun personnel occasionally serves as an adjective, as in Personnel Department, and the Personnel Officer who heads it. Used in this way, it comes close to the domain of personal. Compare personal development with personnel development.

		"title": "personification",
		"explanation":"This is a literary device and figure of speech which imputes a personal character to something abstract or inanimate. Poets personify the great abstracts of our experience, as did Shakespeare in the simile: \n Pity like a naked newborn babe striding the wind . . . \n In such lofty rhetoric the abstract is given human identity, and demands a human response from us. The use of He (His, Him) to refer to God in hymns and religious discourse is also a form of personification. Yet the use of his (with nonhuman subjects) in literature up to and including C17 is not necessarily personification, because until then his served as the possessive for both he and it. The neuter pronoun its appeared first at the end of C16, and was not in regular use until about 1675. This explains its absence from the Authorized Version of the bible, and from Shakespearean texts until the Folio editions of 1623. \n Anthropomorphism and personification. \n Anthropomorphism is a similar device, which gives human form and attributes to the nonhuman, whether a deity, an animal or an object. In ancient art the gods were anthropomorphized, and so Athena, goddess of wisdom and justice, was depicted holding balanced scales, and Diana, goddess of the moon, appears as the huntress with bow and arrow in hand. A modern example would be the way a successful yachtsman might describe his boat as “dancing her way to the finishing line.”"

But it concludes that convince to is now “fully established idiom,” and this view is implicit in contemporary British grammars such as the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) and the Longman Grammar (1999), both of which present the construction with no comment to suggest its illegitimacy. Still it’s probably newer to British ears than American. In BNC data convince to occurs in the ratio of about 1:12 to convince that, whereas it’s 1:2 in CCAE. \n Note finally that both persuade and convince can be followed by of: \n He persuaded me of the need to give up. \n He convinced me of the need to give up."

		"title": "persuasion",
		"explanation":"The desire to persuade or convince the reader is often a motive for writing, one which calls for special attention to writing technique. Keeping readers with you is all-important, anticipating their attitudes and reactions, and managing the subject matter so that your point of view becomes not just plausible but compelling. \n We sometimes think of politicians and advertisers as the archetypal persuaders, yet the arts of persuasion were highly developed as rhetoric in ancient courts of law. Then and now, persuasion depends on getting listeners or readers on side, by an appeal to emotion or reason. Emotion has always been the more direct method – trying to arouse the audience’s anger and/or sympathies as an appeal to their better instincts (see further under pathos). The emotional appeal may also target instincts lower down the body – gut feeling or the hip-pocket nerve. Then and now, persuaders knew the power of appealing to self-interest, with the argumentum ad hominem (see ad hominem). \n Persuaders with more respect for the intelligence of their audience are more likely to invoke reason and logic on their side, and to use the force of argument in persuasion. Classical rhetoric too recognized the place of induction and deduction in constructing an argument; and with less formal logic, today’s persuaders may compile a convincing list of examples to make a general point, or get us to endorse a premise which leads to an inescapable conclusion. (See further under induction and deduction.) Either way they are not simply giving us loose information or an extended narrative, but selecting and structuring a telling set of points for maximum effect. The ultimate key to persuasion is in getting the audience or reader to share your value system – to agree that something is worthwhile, or to be condemned. This often comes back to using evaluative words which embed those values in whatever is being talked about. Environmentalists evoke the common concern with preserving natural resources, and so words like “natural,” “renewable resource” and “rainforest” are positively charged, while “exploitation” and “pollution” carry negative values. Such values can be shared by many people these days, whether they look to nature for recreation or for raw materials. Advertisers often try to persuade by appealing to the social values latent in their readers, their concern with self-image and social status. So words like “luxury,” “glamorous” and “sophisticated” are used to tap that value system, and help consumers reach for their wallets."

Neither database has more than a solitary instance of pertinency, whose use seems to have declined steadily since C19, by Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations.

		"title": "pharmacist, druggist or chemist",
		"explanation":"Americans use the term druggist for the trained maker and dispenser of pharmaceutical remedies. It is a C17 respelling of the French droguiste, never to be confused with drug dealer. The druggist may own a drug store, which retails medicines and other goods more or less closely associated with health care: soaps and talcum powders, bath salts and loofahs, as the advertisement says, not to mention household wares, food and soft drinks. Canadians use druggist as well as pharmacist, which is the standard professional term now in Britain and Australia. The long-standing alternative in British English – and still to some extent in Australia – is chemist, short for dispensing chemist. Chemist in this sense often comes up amid references to other health professionals, as in: \n Ask your school nurse, doctor or chemist for a suitable treatment. \n or alongside other retailers: \n Between the baker’s and the grocer’s was a chemist’s. \n The context thus makes it clear that the local chemist is what’s meant, not the type of chemist who works as a chemical scientist at a university or research laboratory. These academic and industrial applications of the term chemist are shared by English-speakers throughout the world."

	{
		"title": "phase or faze",
		"explanation":"Despite their separate origins and distinct meanings, these sometimes tangle with each other, helped by the interchangeability of ph/f and s/z in some other English words. \n Phase began life in English as a noun, but has since World War II become an administrative verb meaning “carry out in stages.” Its most frequent use is in phrasal verb constructions (phase in, and especially phase out) which are usually passive: \n Tax relief on company cars would be phased out. Other constructions, notably phase down and phase back also express this sense of “planned cutbacks,” as does the adjective phased in examples such as phased reduction and phased divestiture. Given that all these uses of phase are impersonal, it seems surprising that it could be mistaken for faze meaning “disconcert,” which is almost always used of people, as in \n Nixon isn’t fazed by such name-dropping. \n Faze seems to be a C19 American variant of an old dialect verb feeze/feaze meaning “daunt, frighten off,” recorded in various other spellings as well. The instability of its spelling, and the occasional use of phase for faze was first commented on in the 1890s, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989). The fact that both are used in passive constructions (as shown above) would help to explain the substitution. In data from CCAE about 1 in 10 examples of fazed appear as phased: \n He doesn’t seem phased by the lack of commercial success. \n Hardly phased by the disaster, Seattle entered a long period of prosperity. \n The use of by following phased helps to show that these are variants of faze, as does the negative or quasi-negative that typically goes with them, whether in passive or active constructions: None of the drawbacks phased Benson. \n American authorities are divided about whether to accept phase for faze. While Webster’s Dictionary (1961) presents phase as a possible variant, Webster’s English Usage (1989) is not so inclined, and Garner (1998) regards it as a “blunder.” Administrative use of the verb phase probably expanded dramatically in the decades between, and the usage commentators note further dimensions of the problem in very occasional uses of “unphased by,” and of faze being used for phase, as in “fazed out.” These add to the argument for keeping the two spellings apart and attached to separate words. A “fazed withdrawal” – as opposed to phased withdrawal – could make bad PR for a military operation! \n In British English there’s little recent evidence of the interchanging of phase and faze. BNC data provides one example in a transcript of speech: \n the perceiving person is much less phased by this . . . \n The only citations in the Oxford Dictionary (1989) are American ones from C19. The fact that it labels them “erroneous,” and that New Oxford labels faze “informal” would help to explain British caution in writing the word. Yet the BNC has rather more examples of faze in written sources than in transcribed speech. Its relatively recent importation to the UK (in the 1970s) – well after its formative stages in the US – would also account for its more stable spelling in British sources."

		"title": "phenomenon and phenomena",
		"explanation":"These are, respectively, the singular and plural of a classical loanword, presented in all dictionaries as the standard forms (see further under -on). The word is ultimately derived from a Greek verb phaino (“show”). But grammatical transformations mask its origins, and probably underlie uncertainties about its plural form that date from its debut in C16 English. Phenomena has occasionally been used as the singular from 1576 on, by the Oxford Dictionary (1989) record; and usage notes in many dictionaries register it as a current tendency, especially in spoken discourse. Editorial intervention probably helps to reduce its appearances in writing. \n Both plural and singular examples of phenomena can be found in BNC data as well as CCAE, in news and sports reporting. A certain number are directly marked with plural or singular determiners, as in: \n these phenomena many uninteresting phenomena \n a nation-wide phenomena the origins of this phenomena \n The marking of plural (or singular) is sometimes there in the form of a present tense verb: \n when such celestial phenomena as comets are predicted \n the phenomena reminds her of an episode of “MASH” \n In many examples however, phenomena is indeterminate in its grammatical number: \n a clearer view of the phenomena they are investigating \n the state has experienced the same phenomena \n Phrases like natural phenomena and psychic phenomena often seem to be collective concepts, rather than countable plurals. Thus ambiguous usage contributes to the uncertainty as to how phenomena should be construed. Research by Collins (1979) among young Australian adults showed that between 80% and 90% would think of phenomena as a singular. That they (and other young people) do so can be seen as dereliction of grammar and/or the process of assimilation at work. British and American dictionaries diverge on this: New Oxford (1998) makes no bones about calling it a “mistake”; whereas Merriam-Webster (2000) reports the more complex view that it’s “still rather borderline.” The assimilative process is no doubt further advanced in the US, as well as attitudes to it. The larger step in assimilation (the use of phenomenas as a countable plural) is not visible for British or American English in data from either the BNC or CCAE. \n The anglicized plural phenomenons is registered in Webster’s Third (1986), and associated particularly with the use of phenomenon to mean an “outstanding person” and used by publicists and media in the marketing of both persons and products. There are half a dozen examples in CCAE, such as: \n It was one of the publishing phenomenons of the 1980s. \n All of these phenomenons – Roosevelt, Reagan, Abbie etc. – affect us. They become our cultural icons. \n There’s no such evidence of phenomenons in BNC data, nor does it reign supreme in this niche of American English. Counter examples using phenomena can also be found in CCAE: \n Kylie became one of the entertainment phenomena of the 1980s. \n Danzig [a band] is unusual among metal phenomena in that it’s not just a boys’ club. \n Overall then, phenomena seems to be consolidating its position for plural uses, apart from extending its influence into the singular."

Note that the words ending in -phile are sometimes spelled without the final e, and both bibliophile and bibliophil are recognized in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). The abstract noun associated with -phile is usually -philia, as in audiophilia. In a few older cases it can also be -phily, as with bibliophilia or bibliophily, but the -philia form is more common."

		"title": "Philip or Phillip",
		"explanation":"Both spellings are well used in English proper names, as first name or surname, and in placenames. The original Greek name consisted of phil- (“loving”) and (h)ippos (“horse”). So by rights the name should have one l and two ps – as it does in Philippines. Philip of Macedonia, and all the kings of Spain and France had the name as Philip, in keeping with the Greek source. In database evidence from both the US and the UK, Philip is the commoner form of the given name, by about 3:1. \n Phillip is equally well established in English. It shows the doubling of a consonant that has been a headache in English orthography since C18. (Dr. Johnson’s difficulties with it are noted under single for double.) Many an Anglo-Saxon surname has been spelled Phillips, and it’s about twice as common as Philips in BNC data. It gave us the Phillips head screw (named after a Brit) and the Phillips curve in economics (after a New Zealander). Many American and Australian placenames embody the surname with two ls, for example: (in the US) Mount Phillips Phillipsburg (Kansas) Phillips County (in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Montana) \n (in Australia) Phillip Island Port Phillip Bay (Vic.) Phillip (ACT) Phillip Creek (NT) \n Yet Philip also appears in a few American placenames, most notably in Montana where Philipsburg contrasts with the city in Kansas; and in Dakota, with the city of Philip. The spellings are no doubt historically justified in each case, but the effect is arbitrary for those distanced in time and space. \n There are several kinds of reference to help with the Philip/Phillip problem: \n ∗ for placenames: a large atlas or gazeteer \n ∗ for historical names: dictionaries of biography \n ∗ for surnames of living persons: telephone directory or institutional websites \n The spelling for those who have Phil(l)ip as a first name may still be elusive, and need to be checked for the person concerned."

		"explanation":"This Greek word element, meaning “morbid or irrational fear,” is embodied in ordinary words such as claustrophobia, as well as more specialized formations such as Anglophobia and Judophobia, where it generally means “antipathy (to).” The first meaning is uppermost in modern English naming of very specific and sometimes bizarre anxieties: arachnophobia (“fear of spiders”), galeophobia (“fear of sharks”), triskaidekaphobia (“fear of the number 13”). The spawning of such terms made phobia an independent word by early C19, hence the “phobia of inns and coffee houses” recorded in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). A further sign of its independence is the fact that -phobia can now combine with words from languages other than Greek, as in taxophobia (to refer to the collective anxiety of the electorate about increased taxes). \n A person suffering from or obsessed with a phobia is a -phobe or -phobic, as in claustrophobe/phobic.

		"title": "phonesthemes",
		"explanation":"This is the technical name for sounds (usually pairs or sequences of them) which seem to express a particular quality whatever words they appear in. The most noticeable examples are the initial consonant sounds, and those the syllable ends with. The letter s is involved in a number of the classic examples. It seems as if “sk” at the start of words such as scoot, skip, scuttle expresses the quick movement implied in all of them, while “sl” suggests either a falling or sliding movement as in slip, slither, slouch, or something slimy or slushy, as in those words and in sludge, slobber, sloppy. “Sp” seems to represent a quick ejective movement in spit, spatter, spout, spurt; and “sw” a swaying or swinging movement, as in both of those and in sweep, swirl, swagger. \n The closing part of a word also seems to be suggestive of the meaning itself in various cases. Words ending in “ip” often suggest a brisk, quick movement, as with: \n clip flip nip rip skip tip whip \n  The “le” suffix seems to bring a sense of light movement or sound to most words it’s attached to, witness: \n crackle crinkle fizzle giggle prattle \n rustle scuffle trickle twinkle whistle \n (See further under -le.) \n A further example is in words ending in “ump,” which are often associated with heaviness and falling weight. For example: \n clump dump hump lump plump slump thump \n In some words, the effects of phonesthemes at both the beginning and the end of the word are felt, as with slip and slump from the examples above. \n Some of the phonesthemes shown above are older than English itself. In other Indo-European languages, words beginning with “sp” also connote senses such as “spit out” or “reject.” Yet this kind of sound symbolism also depends on there being a sufficiently large group of such words in a language at any one time. Words embodying phonesthemes (like any others) adapt their meanings over the course of time, and may thus dilute the collective effect. And of course there are always other words which coincidentally have the same initial or concluding letters, but whose etymology and current meaning go against the common sound symbolism. Words like space, spade, spectrum could hardly be said to embody any of the sound effects attributed to “sp,” let alone words like spare, special, speculation. \n So phonesthemes are one of the latent aspects of words, useful to poets for onomatopoeia, and to advertisers in promoting their products, but not a powerful force in ordinary prose.

Americans then applied the earlier term phonograph to Berliner’s invention, and the records used on it were also known as phonograms. But in Britain the term phonograph went out with cylinder recordings, and the revolving disk system was always known as the gramophone.

Contemporary databases confirm the British–American divide. In BNC data phoney outnumbers phony by 8:1, while in American data from CCAE the ratio is more than 30:1 in favor of phony. The two spellings are about equally used in Canada and Australia, according to Canadian English Usage (1997) and the Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n The word’s variable spelling goes with its uncertain origins, although most authorities are inclined to a connection with the Irish word fawney, used to refer to cheap jewellery, and to the ring used in confidence tricks. If so the respelling of the word with ph is itself phony, but we can hardly propose a return to f there. We can however give preference to phony as the spelling which avoids any spurious connection with the telephone! \n The stylistic status of the word seems to be rising. Webster’s English Usage (1989) demonstrates its appearances in increasingly respectable American sources after 1960.

		"title": "phrasal and prepositional verbs",
		"explanation":"Many English verbs express their meaning with the aid of a following particle, as in blow up (“explode”), give off (“emit”), turn down (“reject”). They are some of the innumerable multiword verbs now recognized by English grammarians (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985, and the Longman Grammar, 1999). Both phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs consist of a lexical verb plus a closely associated adverb/preposition, whose meaning and grammatical status is neutralized within the larger semantic unit, as the “translations” above show. This integrated unit of verb plus particle is syntactically different from constructions in which the same verb takes a prepositional phrase as adverbial adjunct. Compare turn off (meaning “extinguish”) as in he turned off the light with he turned off the highway, which indicates a direction relative to the noun “highway.” In the first case off is semantically merged with the verb, in the second it works independently as head of the following phrase. \n Phrasal verbs can be transitive or intransitive, according to the idiom. Compare they set off together with they set off the alarm. The transitive phrasal verb allows its object to come either before or after the particle: they set the alarm off is just as acceptable as the other version of that sentence. With such flexibility, phrasal verbs are much used in conversation and in fiction, but rather less so in newspapers or academic writing, according to Longman Grammar research. Many are formed with high-frequency verbs such as take, get, put, come, go, set; others are one-offs, such as freak out, hype up, write off. The verbs involved are typically monosyllabic, and sometimes colloquial, which helps to explain why they are often felt to be “informal.” The criticism of phrasal verbs by commentators such as Gowers (1965) was more specifically aimed at “redundancy” in examples such as drop off, lose out, pay off, where the verb alone could perhaps express the meaning. Yet there are often subtle differences (see lose out). \n Prepositional verbs are not usually objected to, and are in fact three to four times more frequent than phrasal verbs in the Longman Grammar corpus. Examples like account for, consist of, refer to, start with show that they are the staple of argument and discussion, and found almost as often in academic discourse as in conversation. They are differ from transitive phrasal verbs, in not allowing an object to come between the two parts – thus to account for the discrepancy not “to account the discrepancy for.” Yet like the phrasal verb, the prepositional verb keeps its two elements together when the object is preposed, as in something to account for. The objects of prepositional verbs are technically prepositional objects (see transitive and intransitive section 3). \n The strongest objections are usually reserved for what grammarians call phrasal-prepositional verbs, a combination type involving two particles: \n check up on, come up with, face up to, \n get out of, look down on, meet up with, \n walk out on \n Like phrasal verbs, they mostly express activities, and are most commonly used in conversation and fiction. Again this makes them spontaneous or informal in style, and the question of redundancy returns. In fact the second particle usually lends a quasi-transitivity to the intransitive phrasal verb, as in check up on, get out of, meet up with, and fine-tunes the positioning of the narrative. (See for example meet (up) (with).) \n The choice of prepositions after verbs, and their presence or absence, is sometimes a matter of dialect difference. See prepositions section 1."

		"explanation":"A phrase is often thought of simply as a multiword unit, contrasting with the single word. So quick as a flash is a phrase consisting of four words. But for the grammarian a phrase is a unit of a clause. It may consist of a single word (such as a name or pronoun) or of several words. In English we distinguish five types of phrases, according to the grammar of the key word or head: \n ∗ noun phrase with a noun or pronoun as head: their pet cat / it \n ∗ verb phrase with a verb as head: was lying / lay \n ∗ prepositional phrase with a preposition as first word: on the bed / there \n ∗ adjectival phrase with an adjective as head: very well-bred / elegant \n ∗ adverbial phrase with an adverb as head: deep asleep / sleepily \n See individual headings for more about each."

		"title": "pidgins and creoles",
		"explanation":"New languages for old! A pidgin is an ad hoc system of communication, put together from existing languages under special circumstances. It typically happens when groups of people who have no language in common try to communicate with each other, using whatever words they hear being used around them. Pidgins often develop for the purposes of trade, as did “Bazaar Malay,” and the “Bamboo English” used in Korea; but they are also associated with colonial plantations, which employed workers (or slaves) from diverse other places. American “Black English” and New Guinea Pidgin are both thought to have originated this way. \n Pidgins consist of a very basic inventory of words, which work without suffixes and prefixes. Any single word has to do service for a wide range of meanings, witness the use of arse in New Guinea Pidgin to mean “foundation, basis,” and mary as the common noun for “woman, wife, girl, maid.” Pidgin sentences have the simplest grammatical structure and subordination is rare. Both words and grammatical structures are drawn from the dominant language in the context, typically the language of the colonialist, hence the development of “English-based pidgins,” “French-based pidgins” etc. \n Pidgins begin life as very restricted languages, sufficient for communication between peoples who have few dealings with each other. But as people resort to pidgin more often and the topics of conversation increase, it develops as an elaborated pidgin and then into a lingua franca for people in linguistically diverse regions. This was how New Guinea Pidgin grew from its plantation origins to become the lingua franca of the New Guinea region, and now one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea. In fact it has become the native language of many New Guineans, at which point its status is strictly speaking that of a creole, no longer a pidgin. \n Creoles operate as fully-fledged languages in bilingual or multilingual communities. The Caribbean is the home of several, including Haitian Creole based on French, and Jamaican Creole based on English. The creole maintains a mix of elements from local languages, but over the course of time tends to add in lexical and grammatical features of the standard language on which it’s based (English, French etc.), in the process known as decreolization. American Black English is believed by many to be the decreolized product of pidgins used among plantation slaves (see Black English). \n Final notes: the word pidgin is sometimes (rather distractingly) spelled “pigeon,” though the word is more likely to be derived from business than birds. Pidgin is arguably a reduced form of the word “business,” as spoken by those whose language had fewer consonant sounds than English and no “s” sound (rare in languages of the Pacific region). The connection with “business” is eminently likely, seeing that pidgins are often associated with trading. The word creole is borrowed from French, though ultimately it’s a Spanish and Portuguese word meaning “native to the locality.”"

		"explanation":"Should it be pimento-stuffed olives or pimiento-stuffed olives? These are the Portuguese and Spanish forms of the same word for “pepper,” borrowed into English two centuries apart for different applications. Pimento is the Portuguese form, first used in late C17 English for the spice made from the dried berries of the tropical American tree Pimenta droica or Pimenta officinalis, also known as “allspice.” Pimiento, the Spanish form, was borrowed by English-speakers for the fruit of the shrub Capsicum annuum, which is enjoyed for its pungent sweetness, whether eaten red or green. Alternative names for it are the “bell pepper,” “sweet pepper” and “capsicum” itself. By rights then you’d expect pimiento-stuffed olives; and ground pimento to be prescribed in spicy Jamaican dishes. But the names are not uncommonly substituted for each other in both British and American English. Most often it’s pimento being used for pimiento (as in chopped pimento), but now and then the reverse happens, when the recipe calls for a quarter teaspoon of pimiento. As long as the cook knows which is meant, there’s no problem."

		"title": "pinky, pinkie and pinko",
		"explanation":"In both American and British English the spelling pinky is used for the adjective meaning “a shade of pink,” as in the pinky hue of the eastern sky. But both pinky and pinkie are used for the noun referring to the smallest finger, probably based on the Dutch word pinkje (“small”). The British seem to prefer pinkie for this, by the evidence of the BNC, whereas pinky has the edge over pinkie in American data from CCAE. While British writers note the pinkie-ring, their American counterparts tend to write of the pinky-ring. All these uses of pinky/pinkie are standard and can be used in a wide range of written discourse. \n The noun pinkie has some more specialized and informal uses, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). It serves as the name of a small marine fish, as well as the maggot of the greenbottle fly used as fishing bait, as in took small carp on pole and pinkie. In Britain pinkie has been a term for cheap red wine, a usage that continues in Australia. Also derogatory is pinko, which has been applied in Britain and North America to putative communist sympathizers, but now more generally to persons whose politics or social mores are well to the left of the speaker, as in pinko liberal vegetarian or pinko student demonstrations. For obvious reasons, none of these latter usages appear very often in print."

In a pitiful sight and pitiable squalor, either adjective could be used, though the chances are that it would be the first, which is much the more common of the two, in BNC evidence. Piteous stands apart, and is nowadays mostly used to describe vocal sounds, as in a piteous cry, where it also implies weakness and faintness. \n Both pitiful and pitiable can imply a certain contempt for the condition they describe. A pitiable effort or a pitiful attempt at good relations carries negative judgements, rather than pity for what is observed. Thus the connotations of pitiful and pitiable are becoming what they already are for miserable and wretched. This use of pitiful is underpinned by the adverb pitifully, which is again much more freely used than pitiably, by a factor of 20:1 in data from the BNC."

		"title": "pixil(l)ated or pixelated",
		"explanation":"One of these is a good deal older than the other – unsurprising when you know that pixilated embodies the word pixie and pixelated the word pixel (a term coined by computer specialists which blends pix “pictures,” and el[ement]). \n Pixil(l)ated first appears in C19 print, probably as a learned variant of pixie-led which goes back at least two centuries further, and incidentally provides the first citations for pixie. With the rise of pixil(l)ated, pixie-led disappears, and the word’s meaning begins to extend, from the sense of “eccentric, whimsical” to “confused” and so to “tipsy.” The awkward movements of the pixil(l)ated (in the last sense) would then explain the use of pixil(l)ation for a theatrical and especially filmic technique developed in the 1940s, which makes an actor move in a jerky way as if s/he were a celluloid animation. The spellings with one l are of course the standard American forms of these words, while those with two ls are British (see -l-/-ll-). \n Enter pixelated and the computer technique of the 1980s for atomizing images into minute elements from which they can be recreated and manipulated. For some, this manipulation of images is analogous to the filmic technique of pixilation, and pixelated becomes pixilated. The convergence of the two words is no doubt helped by the fact that film-makers can and do contribute to the design of websites and electronic documents. It would of course be neat if pixelated were used for any kind of image manipulation, and pixil(l)ated for the older meanings (“whimsical,” “tipsy”), but language is not necessarily like that. For the moment New Oxford (1998) lists both technical and nontechnical meanings for pixil(l)ated, whereas Merriam-Webster (2000) separates them under pixilated and pixelated, according to the history just described."

For professional writers, it’s a crime, and for student writers, a dishonest and reprehensible practice, whether it involves borrowing from fellow students, or from published sources in print or on the internet.

		"title": "plain or plane",
		"explanation":"These words can have quite similar meanings, and in fact they derive from the same source, the Latin adjective planus (“flat or level”). The different spellings became attached to their different uses in C17. The spelling plane became the one for mathematical and technical nouns, including the vertical plane, the (aero)plane, and the plane used to smooth wood in carpentry. The same word serves as an adjective in plane geometry. \n The other spelling plain is used as a noun in geographical analysis of landscapes, as in a well-watered plain. It also serves as a general-purpose adjective meaning “simple, unadorned.” Plain English aims to be just that, not complex and convoluted (see under that heading). Plainsong (the earliest kind of church music) was sung in unison without any accompaniment. So spelling distinguishes a plain surface, i.e. one without any decoration, from a plane surface, one which may be a subject for discussion in geometry or mathematics. \n Doubts about which spelling to use may arise in figurative expressions, such as the moral plane. The spelling there confirms that it’s a metaphor from mathematics. But when it’s a matter of one plain one purl (in knitting), the plain stitches make the ordinary texture of the fabric. \n The plane tree stands apart from all these uses of plain/plane. It owes its name to a different source altogether, the Latin word platanus."

		"title": "Plain English and plain language",
		"explanation":"Being “plain” is not often a virtue, let alone a rallying call. But if you have been confounded by turgid bureaucratic prose, disarmed by tortuous questions on official forms, and appalled by the prevarications of government communications generally – the word speaks for itself. Those familiar problems were, and still are, the stimulus for Plain English action. \n The Plain English movement gained momentum in the US in the 1970s, its profile raised through the “Doublespeak Awards” of the National Council for the Teachers of English (see doublespeak). President Carter took up the cause, and in 1978 ordered that all government documents should be written in Plain English. In the same decade, the Law Reform Commission of Canada began reviewing all federal laws and recommending Plain English improvements. In Britain, the Plain English Campaign took off in 1979, with the much publicized shredding of unreadable official forms in the Houses of Parliament. By 1982, the British government had officially embraced it, obliging bureaucracies to review and revise their documentation, with changes to over 21 000 forms. The Australian government endorsed Plain English in legislation in 1984. The fact that Plain English is enshrined in legislation helps to explain the initial capital letter, as well as its quasi proper name status. Some paraphrase it as plain language. \n Apart from challenging bureaucratese, the Plain English movement has put the spotlight on impenetrable legal prose, in legislation as well as private legal documents. A good deal of Plain English energy has gone into revising insurance documents, because policy-holders need to understand their rights and responsibilities. Lawyers have not been altogether enthusiastic about Plain English revisions to their texts, for better and worse reasons. Jurists working with Plain English documents could provide legal interpretations in half the time, according to research by the Law Reform Commission of Victoria (Australia), published in 1987. Yet the warning that legal provisions may be altered by Plain English revision still needs to be heeded. Collaborative work between lawyers and Plain English writers is the obvious answer. \n Despite the name, Plain English is only partly about language (on which see below). It also emphasizes the importance of document design. Any document needs clear layout, in sections and paragraphs that express the structure of the information, and with effective headings and subheadings to identify local content. Adequate white space between sections and in lists also makes the information more accessible. Where language comes in, it’s broadly a matter of seeking simple, everyday words whenever possible, and speaking more directly to the reader. Sentences need to be shorter and less intricate, with punctuation that ensures reliable reading. An average of 20 words is recommended, though individual sentences will of course vary around that. The most important principle of Plain English is to keep the reader in mind as you write. Think of yourself as communicating to someone across the table, and of how each sentence sounds. Your writer’s “ear” should react whenever sentences leave the reader gasping for breath. \n 1 Language elements of Plain English: what to avoid: \n *wordy phrases. Many formulaic phrases in official prose can be paraphrased more simply: “in the event of ” often amounts to just plain if, and “in respect of ” to about. High density phrases such as “new employees health and welfare committee” are ambiguous and hard to decode, and can be accessed more easily if unpacked as the “committee on the health and welfare of new employees.” Note that Plain English doesn’t necessarily mean restricting the number of words, especially when expressing something complex. \n *passive constructions that make for roundabout expression. “The motion was supported by all members of the committee” communicates more directly and succinctly as “the committee voted unanimously for the motion.” Passive constructions may still be useful from time to time in maintaining topical progression at the start of sentences (see further under topic, and passive verbs). \n *double or multiple negatives (see double negatives, and negative concord). \n *double-pronged questions. Most people have to think twice at least when asked: \n “Are you over 21 and under 65?” \n The answers will be more reliable if you ask the two questions separately, or else reword them into a single question: \n Are you between 21 and 65 years of age? \n A simple yes or no can be given to that question. \n 2 Adapting to the communicative context with Plain English. \n The Plain English movement is sometimes criticized as attempting to provide a “one size fits all” answer to communication problems. Its most committed practitioners never suggest that, and take care to say that Plain English intervention will vary with the context. Technical jargon is alright for specialist readers, but not the general public. The average paragraph length will probably be longer in a discussion document than, say, in business letters. Imperative verbs can be effective in household or technical instructions, but in advisory documents they sound rather too curt. The use of second person (you) may make advice clearer, but too much direct address can suggest heavy-handed control (see under you). Plain English revisions often affect the tenor of the text, and so revisers must always consider whether this is intended. Is the revision meant to be friendlier (or less so) than the original, or to keep the same distance from the reader? \n 3 The benefits of Plain English. \n In the end Plain English can do more than clarify communication – though that itself is a substantial benefit. It also reduces reading errors, as well as complaints and law suits relating to official documents. Apart from saving time and energy and money on all those fronts, it helps citizens to better understanding of government procedures and policies, and of their own rights."

The latter include its use as a pronoun in we have plenty, and the phrase plenty of, where it works as a complex determiner (see under determiners). Like most general quantifiers, plenty of may take a singular or plural verb in agreement, depending on the noun involved. Compare: \n Plenty of time was allowed. \n Plenty of laughs come with them. \n Plenty can also be an adverb, as in The water’s plenty hot enough. Constructions like these, where plenty modifies a quantifiable adjective, could be used anywhere in the world. They are however labeled “informal” or “colloquial” by dictionaries such as New Oxford (1998), Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). The note in Merriam-Webster (2000) focuses rather on the loss of precision when plenty is replaced by other adverbs. American English goes further with adverbial plenty, using it to modify participial adjectives, e.g. He was plenty scared; as well as verb phrases such as having practiced plenty, and he got around plenty. Webster’s English Usage notes adverbial plenty as common in American speech and writing, except of the “starchier” sort."

		"title": "pleonasm",
		"explanation":"This means using a combination of words which overlap or duplicate each other in meaning. In some cases it may be viewed negatively, as overwriting or redundancy; in others it seems acceptable either because it’s the established idiom, or because it lends intensity to whatever is being said. \n 1 The negative side of pleonasm is usually referred to as “redundancy” or “tautology.” (Note that for philosophers the word tautology is neutral in meaning. See under induction.) Samples of redundancy are all too common in officialese, in the unnecessary abstract nouns: \n the weather conditions for the race \n problems in the classroom situation \n Redundancy is particularly common in impromptu public speaking by politicians and radio announcers, as they try to maintain continuous output with not quite enough ideas for their rate of speaking, as in phrases like: \n the two twins, new innovations,  revert back \n More conspicuous examples are the focus of pompous or ponderous statements such as: \n Traditionally, most of our imports have come from overseas. \n In all such cases, the redundant word weasels meaning out of the other one. \n 2 Acceptable pleonasms. Numerous time-honored English phrases are strictly tautologous, witness: \n free gifts, grateful thanks, past history, usual habit \n Though the adjective adds little to the noun in such expressions, they are sanctioned by usage, and in some cases by the highest authorities in the land. Many pleonasms come from law and religion: \n last will and testament, null and void, join together, lift up \n Such expressions do have a function in their original context, in their rhetorical effect and in providing synonyms for less familiar words. Rhetorical emphasis is certainly part of the effect in the very common speech-maker’s line: \n I have one further point to add. \n The doubling up of “further” and “add” draws attention to the start of a new structural unit in the text, and underscores the final argument. Why should we quibble at that, any more than we do at Shakespeare’s dramatic use of tautology in “the most unkindest cut of all?” The double superlative, like the double negative, may be condemned as tautology, or recognized as a resource for intense expression. If you’re aiming at hyperbole, pleonasm helps to create it in: \n What wasteful superfluous trivia I had rammed into my head as a kid! \n As an example of bogus semiotic pseudo-scholarship, this book is priceless. \n See further under hyperbole and figures of speech."

See for example: \n . . . the plethora of spurious genealogies that litter the later literature \n There has been a plethora of books on country houses, but PM and BD have found a new approach. \n As in these examples, plethora can take a plural or singular verb. When it follows a countable plural (as in the first), it will be plural: but proximity to plethora itself (as in the second) may make it singular (see agreement section 5). The use of a mass noun following plethora also prompts a singular verb: The plethora of published research is testimony to this. \n As a classical abstract noun, plethora meant “fullness” and had no plural.

For the plural forms of numbers and letters, see letters as words, and numbers and number style. \n  1 Plurals of common nouns. The letter s is the standard English plural suffix, used with the oldest words of the language, well-established borrowings and all new coinings. Being the default pattern, it’s often left unsaid in dictionary entries, and only the nonstandard plurals of nouns are indicated. These nonstandard patterns and the words that take them include: \n a) -es plurals, associated with several groups of nouns: \n ∗ those ending in an “s,” “z,” “tch,” “dg,” “sh” or “ks” sound such as \n kisses, quizzes, batches, ridges, dishes, boxes \n ∗ those ending in plain y (as opposed to a vowel plus y [-ay etc.]) where the y changes to i before adding -es, as in allies, cherries. See further under -y and -y > -i-. \n ∗ some of those ending in f (or fe), which changes to v before the -es, as in loaves, wives. See further under -f > -v-. \n ∗ some of those ending in o, such as echoes. See further under -o. \n b) internal vowel changes for the plural, found in some very old words such as man>men, woman>women; foot>feet, goose>geese, tooth>teeth; louse>lice, mouse>mice. Note the change of consonant as well in the last pair \n c) -(r)en plurals, found in just three words: children, oxen, brethren. The third is an old plural of brother, used only in restricted contexts these days. See brethren. \n d) zero plurals (i.e. no change at all from singular to plural), as with aircraft, apparatus, sheep. See zero plurals. \n e) Latin plurals for loanwords from Latin (some also have English plurals in -s). See under -a, -is, -um, -us, -x. \n f) Greek plurals for loanwords from Greek (some also have English plurals in -s). See under -a and -on. \n g) French plurals in -x for loanwords from French ending in -eau, -ieu, -iau (some also have English plurals in -s). See -eau and -ieu. \n h) Italian plurals for loanwords from Italian (most if not all have English plurals in -s as well). See under Italian plurals \n i) Hebrew plurals in -im for a few recent loanwords from Hebrew. See under -im \n 2 Plurals of compounds. Ordinary English compounds are pluralized simply by adding s at the end, whether they are set solid, spaced or hyphenated: \n baby-sitters breakdowns \n forget-me-nots geography teachers \n  go-betweens grownups \n  handouts, shop assistants \n  tip-offs wordprocessors \n The chief exceptions are compounds in which the key noun comes first, as with: \n ambassadors-at-large goings-on \n grants-in-aid passers-by \n  rights-of-way sisters-in-law \n The traditional plurals for some legal and historical terms also have the -s attached internally: \n attorneys-general, courts martial \n heirs apparent, judges advocate \n poets laureate, sergeants major \n Titles like these originated in French where nouns normally precede adjectives, and so the first word (the noun) naturally takes the plural inflection, rather than the adjective which comes second. These plurals have lasted for centuries in English official usage; but those in everyday use also have anglicized equivalents, e.g. court martials, sergeant majors, which add the plural inflection at the end, as if they were ordinary compounds. (For the plural of Governor General / governor-general, see under that heading.) \n Other foreign compounds, especially those from modern French, raise similar issues. A few are pluralized in the French way, for example aides de camp, objets d’art, pieces de r ` esistance ´ , no doubt because their structure is clear even in English, and we recognize that the key noun comes first. In cases where the phrase is not transparent, the plural s is simply added to the last word: \n cul-de-sacs, hors d’oeuvres, roman à clefs, vol-au-vents \n These seem pretty strange if you know the French words, but it’s a sign of their assimilation into English (see individual headings). The plural of grand prix poses its own particular problems in English (see grand prix). \n The tendency to just add an s at the end is even stronger with Latin compounds, witness postmortem(s), pro forma(s), curriculum vitae(s). See further under those headings. \n 3 Plurals of proper names and titles. On the somewhat rare occasions when we need to pluralize personal names, we usually add an s or es in accordance with the general rules for nouns: \n The Smiths and the Joneses are on our list. \n Note that names ending in y never have it changed to i: \n McNallys are on the list too. \n When two people share a surname and title, either title or name may bear the plural marker: \n Misses Smith, Messrs. Smith \n Miss Smiths, Mr. Smiths. \n The pluralized title still appears in any formal or corporate address (e.g. on envelopes), whereas the pluralized name is more likely elsewhere. When the surnames are different, the only option is to pluralize the title: Misses Smith and Jones; Messrs. Smith and Jones. Note that there’s no plural for the title Mrs., unless we use Mesdames. Ms. can be pluralized as Mss. or Mses., but neither is much used yet. The plural of Dr. is simply Drs. \n 4 Plurals of national groups. The names of national and tribal groups are now usually made in the regular way with s: growing numbers of Khmers (not Khmer). Increasingly people feel that using the zero plural (Khmer) is unfortunately like the standard plural for various groups of animals (see further under zero plurals). The only national names to keep their zero plurals are ones ending in sibilants, notably -ese and -ish: the Japanese, the British."

		"title": "plus",
		"explanation":"From its home base in mathematics, plus has been annexed into ordinary usage, as in total cost plus postage. The example shows how plus has extended its scope in constructions that are not explicitly quantitative, and from there into specifying any kind of additional factor, whether it belongs to the same genre or not: \n This led her into masterpieces like G and L of S, plus a fistful of failed marriages. \n This prepositional use is accepted by current dictionaries such as New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000), as are its extended uses as noun and adjective (in the plus, on the plus side). Plus is sometimes used postpositively, especially following numbers as in the 60-litre plus range, but also in verbal estimates: “Jeremy has his talent plus” said Lucy. Although there may be an informal feel to these constructions, they appear freely in many kinds of writing. There are over 6000 examples in written sources in the BNC and more than twice that in CCAE. \n The only use of plus which seems to be queried by dictionaries and usage commentators is its appearance as a conjunct or conjunction, illustrated below: \n I have a high-powered job. Plus I have just signed on a major new client. \n I have a high-powered job, plus I have just signed on a major new client. \n Punctuation is all that distinguishes the two uses. The first example makes plus a conjunctive adverb meaning “as well,” which is unproblematic because that word class is relatively open-ended. But the second sets it up as a conjunction, and implicitly challenges the closed set of words normally called ”conjunction.” (See further under conjunctions.) Both kinds of use have been noted in American English since the 1960s, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989), though not in formal contexts. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) documents the “quasi-conjunction” from 1968 on, and labels it “informal.” So conjunctive plus is still establishing its credentials in written English in both the US and the UK, whereas its other uses as preposition, adjective and noun are accepted. \n For the plural of plus, pluses is strongly preferred over plusses. The first outnumbers the second by more than 10:1 in both British and American databases."

		"title": "p.m. or pm",
		"explanation":"This is the standard abbreviation for times of day which fall between noon and midnight. It stands for Latin post meridiem (“after midday”). Full stops are not essential with it, since it cannot be confused with any other word, and its time function is made clear by the numbers (between 1 and 12) which precede it. However some writers and editors would use stops with it, in accordance with their general policy on lower case abbreviations, and their treatment of its counterpart a.m./am (see abbreviations section 2). In British data from the BNC there were almost equal numbers of p.m. and pm, whereas the second is still strongly preferred in American usage, by the evidence of CCAE, despite their general preference for retaining stops in abbreviations. There was no widespread use of PM, the other American alternative (compare a.m.). \n Note that p.m. times begin immediately after noon, and so the first minute after 12 noon (= 12 a.m.) is 12.01 p.m. This naturally means that 12 midnight is 12 p.m., and the first minute of the next day is 12.01 a.m. \n By using p.m. you indicate clearly to readers that you’re not working with a 24-hour clock. This may be important in talking travel arrangements with those who are unused to 24-hour schedules. But in international travel, “arriving at 6.30” would always mean a morning arrival, and the equivalent evening arrival (= 6.30 p.m.) would be specified as 18.30."

		"title": "poky or pokey",
		"explanation":"British and American English are diverging in the use of these spellings and the meanings attached to them. The British use poky to mean “small and cramped,” as in a poky little flat, and they strongly prefer the spelling poky to pokey, by a factor of 10:1 in data from the BNC. Americans meanwhile prefer pokey for the spelling, and typically use it to mean “slow-moving.” Examples in CCAE range from pokey local traffic, to pokey service in a restaurant, to a pokey disk drive on the computer. Poky too is used for this meaning in about 30% of cases, but less than you would expect when it’s given as the primary spelling in Merriam-Webster (2000). Also curious is the fact that the dictionary foregrounds the sense “cramped,” which in CCAE data can only be seen in the pokey, a slang term for “jail.” Canadians live with both American and British senses of pok(e)y, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998). Australians also have pokie, an informal word for the poker machine, which usually appears in the plural, as in playing the pokies."

		"title": "polarity",
		"explanation":"Language, like a magnetic field, may be charged either positively or negatively. This polarity is rarely an issue in statements about the way things are, because the facts of the situation decide whether it should be positive or negative. Either: \n Schools reopen next Monday. \n or \n Schools do not reopen next Monday – not until the week after. \n But when posing questions we quite often seek to know whether something is or is not: \n Has the minister overlooked the matter? \n  Would they prefer coffee? \n In such questions, the polarity has yet to be established, and they are in fact known to many as polar questions. Because they require either yes or no for an answer, they are also known as yes/no questions. (See questions section 2.) \n The polarity of a statement affects that of the tag question that echoes it. Compare the following: \n You’d like to come, wouldn’t you? \n You wouldn’t want to come, would you? \n As these sentences show, a positive statement is normally followed by a negative tag question, and vice versa."
	},
	{
		"title": "polemic or polemical",
		"explanation":"These two complement each other, with polemic working as the noun (a largely ill-informed polemic) and polemical as adjective (N. writes with a polemical edge). Very occasionally polemic is also an adjective, but it happens in less than 10% of all instances in British data from the BNC, and only slightly more in American source material in CCAE."

		"title": "police",
		"explanation":"Because this word is a collective noun, and regularly takes a plural verb, it leaves the question of its singular in doubt. Policeman and policewoman are well-established terms but neither is gender-free. When this is needed, police officer serves for both sexes and for persons of any rank, because police are not divided into officers and rank-and-file, like the defense forces. Any “policeperson” can be addressed as “Officer.” In American English police officer is the most frequent term by far, by the evidence of CCAE, used for men and women in the service. In British English too, police officer serves for both sexes, yet policeman outnumbers it by a factor of 3:1 in data from the BNC. For some, policeman remains the generic term, as in a policeman’s lot. There’s no sign of policeperson in either database."
	},
	{
		"title": "political or politic",
		"explanation":"These two have diverged, so that politic is now confined to the meaning “judicious, prudent in public affairs,” and political covers the broad range of “belonging to the state or government or a power group and its policies.” Politic once covered that ground too, as fossilized in the body politic. But the area was taken over by political by mid-C18."
	},
	{
		"title": "political correctness",
		"explanation":"The term political correctness gained currency in the mid-1980s, in the backlash against pressures to avoid sexism and other kinds of noninclusive language. It expresses resistance to any affirmative action against language bias, and projects it as a kind of language police state. The putative curbs on freedom of expression are played up, and the intended goals of better social integration are played down. It insists on the individual’s right to continue using modes of expression which have been unexceptionable in the past. \n For liberal-minded linguists, it poses a dilemma: testing their social conscience as well as the tenet that language norms are made by the community and cannot be imposed (see Whorfian principle). Yet the longer-term effects of highlighting language bias do seem to be reduced use of sexist and racist terms in print in late C20 English. This has been underpinned by the articulation of nonsexist/inclusive language guidelines in publishing houses, media outlets and institutions – though skeptics would question their impact on private discourse and on community thinking. \n Whatever the depth and breadth of socially motivated language reforms, the phrase political correctness is here to stay. It can now express resistance to affirmative action in other arenas than language, in the US and the UK: \n It’s only recently that political correctness has demanded that fathers be not at the birth. \n In an act of knee-jerk political correctness, the University has sold all its Microsoft shares because it is doing business in South Africa. \n Other signs of the productivity of the phrase are spinoffs such as politically correct and politically incorrect. These too are frequently used outside the realms of language, as in a politically correct mix of ethnic groups, and the most politically incorrect artist. \n Because of its bulk, political correctness tends to be abbreviated in casual conversation. On its rare appearances in print, the abbreviation may be seen in lower case, according to New Oxford (1998) – as in applauded for p.c. effort from the BNC. In American English upper case is usual, according to Merriam-Webster (2000). Either way, with or without stops, it coincides with several other abbreviations based on the same letters (see separate entry on PC, p.c., pc or pc.). The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1998) documents the form non-PC in an American advertisement, but neither this nor other derivatives such as PC-ness can be found in the BNC or CCAE."

		"title": "pollex",
		"explanation":"For the plural of this word, see -x section 3."

	{
		"title": "poly- and poly",
		"explanation":"This Greek-derived prefix has taken off in new directions from its core sense “many,” found in Greek loanwords such as: \n polygamy polyglot polygon \n polymath polyphonic polysyllabic \n The first modern English applications of poly- were in chemistry, in the names of new compounds: \n polyester polymer \n polythene polyunsaturated \n But as chemical terms such as these became household words, poly- itself acquired new meanings. Polyunsaturated helped to form a second generation of words such as polymeat and polymilk – where polymeans a relatively high level of polyunsaturated fat. A different set of derivative words connect with polyester, and it gives its meaning to the prefix in polycotton, polyviscose, polywool – textile blends containing polyester. \n In contemporary English poly- has also become an independent word, with more than one application. For the British its most familiar use has been as an abbreviation for Polytechnic, hence the juxtaposition of university, poly or college. Americans also know this use, in sports reporting that refers to the Brooklyn Poly, Cal Poly or other teams associated with a Polytechnic. Poly is now used in both varieties of English as shorthand for polymer/polythene, and appears on the labels of household products such as the poly brush, poly-coated (board), poly wrap. These uses of poly as a noun require a plural, which is always polys, by the consensus of both current dictionaries and the reference databases."

		"title": "Polynesia",
		"explanation":"Together with Melanesia and Micronesia, Polynesia provides a geographical term for various groups of Pacific islands, as well as an ethnic or anthropological term for their diverse inhabitants. \n Polynesia is the broadest of the three, covering the islands from Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the south, and including Samoa, Tahiti and Tonga. The Melanesian group are west of Polynesia, and include Fiji, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and the Solomons. Micronesia embraces a set of small islands east of the Philippines, the best known of which are the Mariana, Caroline and Marshall islands, as well as Kiribati and Nauru. \n The three words were coined by the French explorer Dumont D’Urville in the 1820s. All contain the Greek root -nes- (“island”), and so Polynesia is the “many-island group,” Micronesia is the “tiny-island group”, and Melanesia the “black-island group.” The last group may be so named because of the skin color of their inhabitants, or perhaps because of the dark profile of the islands as seen from sea level."
	},
	{
		"title": "polysemy",
		"explanation":"Many words have more than one meaning, and polysemy (“multiple meaning”) is the normal state for all our common words. Dictionaries have to enumerate a set of definitions, not just one for each of them. So to talk in terms of the “true meaning” of a word is rather a misconception. Only new words, and especially scientific and technical ones, have a single meaning, and even they tend to gather new meanings around themselves as they gain wider currency Scientists sometimes lament the fact that “their words” are used differently by others – that expressions like calorie, paranoia and quantum leap have developed nontechnical meanings. It simply shows polysemy working in the usual way. \n Some words develop meanings in so many different directions that they might seem to have come from quite independent sources. Thus tank (“armored vehicle”) and the tank where farmers in various English-speaking countries store water are one and the same word, though there’s no obvious connection between them. Cases of polysemy like that need to be distinguished from homonymy, where two or more words two from quite separate sources coincide, as with the lock on the door and lock of hair. See further under homonyms."

	{
		"title": "pommel and pummel",
		"explanation":"In origin these are one and the same, referring to a knob that projects from the top of a sword or the rounded peak of a saddle, hence also the pommel horse used in gymnastic routines. Pommel goes back to C14, and began to be used as a verb for punching with one’s fists in C16. Pummel emerged at about the same time as an alternative. But in C20 English the two spellings have become attached to noun and verb respectively. This happened sooner in the UK than the US, judging by the fact that pommel is still represented as the spelling for noun or verb in Merriam-Webster (2000) – though there’s scant evidence of pommel as a verb in CCAE. \n Meanwhile pummel as verb has extended its range considerably. In British English it can be used to describe physical punching, as in pummelled the pillows as well as assaulting the ears, for example the pummelling bass in a band. The further reaches of pummel can be seen in American English, where it’s also used figuratively with the sense “give/take a beating,” of a region pummeled by war or a show pummeled by the critics. Finance reporters use it to dramatize events in the day’s trading, such as the pummeling of the greenback in international currency markets. \n As the examples show, Americans have pummeled/pummeling as the inflected forms, whereas the British use pummelled/pummelling: see -l-/-ll-."

Populist puts a negative cast on appealing to public sentiment for strategic advantage: The Gallery is bowing to populist pressures. Popular complements it with the sense of being favored by the general public.

Few of those which he himself coined have been taken up in general usage, apart from the verb chortle, a blend of “chuckle” and “snort.” The portmanteau words which do gain currency are typically nouns or verbs referring to something new or newly identified in our times: \n  breathalyser brunch cultivar electrocute \n guesstimate heliport telecast \n In examples like those the two components are still recognizable enough to contribute to the meaning of the word. This also seems important in the survival of a blend, and explains the rapid demise of rather obscure ones such as catalo (cross between “cattle” and “buffalo”) and incentivation (a blend of “incentive” and “motivation”). But well-chosen portmanteau words can provide both name and slogan for a new product, witness: \n Everlastic Glampoo Soyamaise Sunbrella"

		"title": "post-",
		"explanation":"This prefix, meaning “after,” was a preposition in classical Latin. In Anglo-Latin its life as a prefix began in words like postponere and postmeridianus, which have found their way into English as postpone and postmeridian. In modern English post- mostly helps to form adjectives which designate a period in time: \n postclassical postdoctoral postglacial \n postgraduate posthumous postmedieval \n  postnatal postprandial \n As these examples show, the prefix post- normally combines with scholarly, latinate words. The most notable exceptions are postwar and postmodern. In technical terminology post- often creates antonyms for a more familiar word prefixed with pre-, for example postfix, postlude, postposition. Entirely different is the post- of expressions such as postman and the British postcode. This is a French loanword (poste), based on Italian (posta), which is ultimately derived from Latin posita (“placed”)."

		"title": "post hoc",
		"explanation":"This Latin phrase means literally “after this.” It abbreviates the longer phrase post hoc ergo propter hoc, meaning “after this therefore because of this.” It identifies the fallacy of concluding that an event was caused by whatever preceded it – mistaking sequence in time for a causal relationship.

		"title": "post mortem, post-mortem and postmortem",
		"explanation":"In Latin post mortem means “after death,” but in English it’s used specifically for the post-mortem examination, i.e. an autopsy performed on a dead body to establish the cause of death. Both post-mortem and postmortem are used instead of the full official phrase, the latter showing the typical solid-setting of emerging compound nouns (see hyphens 2d). Dictionaries generally prefer the hyphened form for all uses of the word, and it’s given priority in New Oxford (1998) as well as Merriam-Webster (2000). This agrees with database evidence, where post-mortem outnumbers postmortem by about 4:1 in both BNC and CCAE. Perhaps the string of consonants in the non-hyphened spelling still seems intimidating, even after more than 200 years of use. The fact that it now has many nonlegal uses (as in an election postmortem), should help the process of assimilation."

This at any rate is the Spanish explanation of that otherwise rather puzzling phrase, and shows how the French, and the English, could come to use it for something attractive, especially the mixture of dried petals and spices kept as nature’s own deodorant. \n Both the Spanish olla podrida and the potpourri can be used in reference to any collection of assorted items, and so to such things as a miscellany of musical or literary pieces.

		"title": "practical or practicable",
		"explanation":"Is a practical suggestion the same as a practicable one? It could be, though the two words focus on slightly different things. A practical suggestion is one which comes to grips with the situation, while a practicable suggestion is one that’s feasible and could be put into practice. The tone of the two words is different, in that practical comments and commends in a straightforward way, while practicable is more detached and academic in its assessment. In British (BNC) database evidence, the ratio between practicable and practical is about 1:13, whereas in CCAE practicable is much rarer, appearing in the ratio of 1:70. This suggests that practical tends to serve for both words in the US. \n The two words have several opposites. For practicable the antonyms are impracticable and unpracticable. Fowler’s choice (1926) was impracticable, which overwhelms the other in 433 www.IELTS4U.blogfa.com practice or practise contemporary British and American writing, on the evidence of the BNC and CCAE. For practical there are two kinds of antonym with different applications: (1) theoretical, and (2) either impractical or unpractical. Fowler put his weight behind unpractical and dismissed impractical, and the latter was labeled “rare” in the original Oxford Dictionary. But at the turn of the millennium impractical is strongly preferred in both British and American databases, and the label has been removed from Oxford’s second edition (1989). Those who use both unpractical and impractical sometimes apply the first to people (an unpractical person), and the second to inanimates (an impractical scheme). For those who use only impractical, this division of labor does not exist; and only 2 out of the 9 instances of unpractical in the BNC refer to people. So impractical and impracticable have won the day, and British writers make considerable use of both. Their American counterparts incline much more toward impractical – limiting the options, as with practical."

		"title": "practice or practise",
		"explanation":"The choice between these depends first on which variety of English you’re writing, and secondly on grammar. In British and Australian English, practice is the standard spelling for the noun, and practise for the verb. Complementary spellings with -ce/-se are used elsewhere in English to distinguish nouns from verbs, although in most such cases they match up with different pronunciations (see under -ce/-se). American English uses practice for the verb as well as the noun – a preference which reflects their common pronunciation, and is in keeping with the more general American avoidance of -ise as a verb ending (see -ize/-ise). In data from CCAE there’s only a handful of cases of practise, against thousands of practice. Canadian usage is very mixed, according to Canadian English Usage (1997): many writers use the British system while the press tends to go with the American. \n The alternative ways of dealing with this word pose more problems for the British than the Americans in expressions where the word’s grammar is debatable. Compare: \n   golf practice (British) - golf practice (American) \n they practise on Saturdays (British) -they practice on Saturdays (American) \n a practice?practise range (British) - a practice range (American) \n In the third example, is it a noun or a verb? \n Compounds like this more often consist of noun + noun, yet verb + noun is a possibility: compare dance party. At the best British golf clubs there’s a dilemma, where for Americans there is none. \n The spellings practice/practise hint at the separate C14 origins of the two, practice in the noun practic, and practise in the verb practisen, with stress on the middle syllable. The Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) many alternative spellings recorded from the next two centuries suggest that the verb took on the early stress of the noun, and its second syllable was then pronounced like that of “service.” At the same time the noun’s pronunciation and spelling were changing to match the verb, in forms such as practis/practys. Shakespeare, like many in C16, used practise for both. This complex past underlies the divergences of the present, where American English runs with a single spelling and British uses two. As elsewhere, British English works with fine distinctions where American English looks for the larger patterns. See further under spelling, rules and reforms."

		"title": "pre-",
		"explanation":"This well-worked Latin prefix means “before.” In many words including most modern formations, it means “prior in time”; but in older loanwords and a few modern technical words, it can mean “standing in front.” We derive it from numerous Latin loanwords such as: \n preclude predict prefer prefix \n preliminary prepare prevent \n In modern English it teams up easily with words of both French and Anglo-Saxon origin to make new ones: \n predate predawn predestined preheat \n prejudge prepaid preschool preshrunk \n prestressed preview \n The examples show pre- as a formative element in many common nouns, verbs and adjectives, though it also combines with proper names to identify a historical or geological period by the one adjacent to it. For example: pre-Cambrian, pre-Christian, pre-Shakespearean, pre-Raphaelite. In those cases there’s a hyphen between pre- and the next word, because of its initial capital. Hyphens are not otherwise needed, except perhaps when pre- is attached to a word beginning with -e or another vowel, e.g. pre-empt, pre-eminent, pre-exist and pre-arrange, pre-industrial, pre-owned. At this point British writers are more inclined to use a hyphen than their American counterparts, and so New Oxford (1998) hyphenates all those examples where Merriam-Webster (2000) has them set solid, except for the last. Yet even British writers and dictionaries have preadolescent, preoccupied, preordain, suggesting that well-established derivatives with predo not need hyphens even when vowels are juxtaposed. The context of occurrence often helps to prevent misreading. When elections are in the air, the preelection campaign is unlikely to miscue the reader. \n Because pre- means the same as ante-, the two prefixes present a few corresponding pairs: \n predate/antedate precedent/antecedent \n prenatal/antenatal \n In each case the word with ante- is more restricted in meaning or its context of use. Overall there are many more words with pre-, no doubt because of the risk of confusing ante- with the very different anti-. (See ante-/anti-.) \n Pre- serves as the contrasting prefix to post-, as in prewar/postwar. See further under post-."

Since only transitive verbs can work in the passive, precede is the only possibility in constructions like: \n I was preceded by a long queue of passengers. \n (See further under transitive.)

Precedent is a countable noun meaning a “model or example from the past,” which is used in idioms such as set a precedent, no precedent for or find a precedent for (something).

		"title": "precipitate or precipitous",
		"explanation":"Both adjectives can embody the idea of rushing headlong, though precipitate originates in the time dimension, and precipitous in space (like precipice). Archetypal examples of each are a precipitate strike and precipitous canyons. Yet precipitous is increasingly used in more figurative ways which bring it close to precipitate. When financial reporters write of a precipitous decline in the value of shares, they are no doubt thinking of the way the trend would appear as a line on a graph, a sharp fall which when plotted against time means a rapid event. Thus precipitous comes to mean “sudden and dramatic,” and to serve instead of precipitate – as in almost 20% of instances in the BNC. The scope for using it this way, and in talking about precipitous action (i.e. not necessarily related to statistical trends) is taken much further in American English. Close to 80% of examples of precipitous in CCAE express the temporal meaning, and it’s registered in both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000). \n The trend toward using precipitous instead of precipitate for “sudden and dramatic” correlates with the fact that precipitate itself is now more often used as a verb than adjective (in about 60% of instances in the BNC and 80% in CCAE). In this way they complement each other grammatically, with precipitate as verb (or noun), and precipitous the adjective for spatial, temporal and other figurative senses. Realignments like this are the stuff of English language history."

		"title": "predicate",
		"explanation":"This traditional grammar term still has a useful role in identifying the elements of a clause which complement the subject to form a statement. (In transformational grammars the predicate is called the verb phrase, which conflicts with other important uses of that phrase. See under verb phrase.) Together the subject and predicate (italicized in the following examples) embody the heart of a clause, as in: \n Empty vessels make the most sound. \n Actions speak louder than words. \n The pen is mightier than the sword. \n In statements the subject usually precedes the predicate, though some (or all) of the predicate comes first in certain questions, negative statements and other inversions (see under inversion and subject). Further points about the predicates of positive statements are discussed below. \n 1 The predicate always contains a finite verb, and, depending on the nature of that verb, another component. Some grammarians simply call it the “complement,” but many others including the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) and the Longman Grammar (1999) identify three different kinds of complement to the verb, namely (a) object, (b) adverbial, (c) complement (in a more restricted sense). The three types are illustrated by our three proverbs: \n a) Empty vessels make the most sound. subject/verb/object (SVO) \n Objects are often needed with a verb of action to complete its sense (see further under transitive and object). The object may be a noun phrase, as in that example, or a pronoun. \n b) Actions speak louder than words. subject/verb/adverbial (SVA) \n Some verbs of action take an adverbial which details it in terms of the manner, place or time in which it takes place. The adverbial may be only a single word, or a phrase (usually an adverbial or prepositional phrase). The term adjunct is used for this component by grammarians such as Halliday (1985) and Huddleston and Pullum (2002). \n c) The pen is mightier than the sword. subject/verb/complement (SVC) \n Complements in this restricted sense typically come after the verb be or another copular or linking verb, and help to detail the subject of the clause. (See further under copular verbs.) They are typically noun phrases, adjectives or adjectival phrases, as in the example. Some English adjectives, e.g. ahead, asleep, awry can only appear predicatively (see adjectives section 1). \n 2 Occasionally a predicate consists of a verb alone, as in: \n The telephone rang. (SV) \n He had been sleeping. (SV) \n The younger staff would come. (SV) \n As these examples show, the verb component may be a simple verb, or a combination of auxiliaries and main verb forming a verb phrase. For further extensions of the verb phrase by infinitives, as in They managed/intended to come, see catenatives. \n 3 Three-part predicates are required for three groups of verbs to complete the clause. They create the predicate patterns VOO, VOA, and VOC, illustrated in the following: They gave him oxygen. (SVOO) \n They put him in an ambulance. (SVOA) \n They made him a hero. (SVOC) \n The first group are ditransitive verbs, which require OO (i.e. both indirect and direct objects), because they involve transmitting something to someone. The second group of complex transitive verbs are those with the pattern OA, which typically place or locate an object, and the adverbial shows where. The third group with the pattern OC includes verbs that confer a status (notional or actual) on the object, using an extra complement to express it. As in SVC clauses, the complement is often an adjective: They thought/called it miraculous. A rare variant of SVOC is the SVCC pattern, as in That house is worth a million. \n Final note on predicates. The patterns described above show the obligatory elements of the predicate, without which the clause would be incomplete. However English clauses often include other optional elements, particularly adverbials, as in They immediately gave him oxygen (SAVOO). Additional adverbials may precede or follow the obligatory elements of the predicate."

		"title": "predominant or predominate, and predominantly or predominately",
		"explanation":"Both predominant and predominate have served as adjectives in English since late C16, though the first has occupied centre stage and is far more common. In databases of American and British English, instances of predominate as adjective can be counted on the fingers of one hand (the spelling is almost entirely used for the verb). But as Webster’s English Usage (1989) noted, the equivalent adverb predominately is also current and somewhat more common than the adjective. The ratio of predominately to predominantly is about 1 in 20 in CCAE and about 1 in 50 in the BNC – though two thirds of the cases of predominately are from transcriptions of speech where there’s little to separate the two. It is also possible that writers and editors have long been inclined to make the adverb match the dominant form of the adjective, and assumed that the minority form was a mistake."

		"title": "preface",
		"explanation":"Between the title page of a book and the start of the main text, there may be any or all of the following: foreword, preface, introduction. The boundaries between them, and their location, vary with the publisher and the publication. \n An introduction by the author is these days often as long as a chapter of the book itself; and when it outlines the book’s structure and contents, it may be treated as the first segment of the main text and paginated in arabic numbers with the rest. However when the main text is a reference book, such as a dictionary, even long introductory essays are paginated in lower case roman numbers, and made part of the preliminary matter. (See further under prelims.) \n The foreword and/or preface are always paginated in roman. In older bookmaking practice they would both precede the table of contents, and this is still recommended by the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors (1981). The reverse is recommended in Copy-editing (1992) and the Chicago Manual (2003). Their rationale is that the table of contents should come first, so that a reader can immediately locate all the components of the book, and then begin to read more discursively. A possible compromise is to put the foreword before the table of contents and the preface after it. This seems a sensible compromise if, as often, the foreword is brief (only two or three paragraphs), and is written by someone other than the author – usually a celebrated person whose name lends distinction to the volume. The preface is usually written by the author (or editor, if the work is an anthology), and may amount to two or three pages. It typically explains how the book came into being, and acknowledges the contribution of others to it. Sometimes the acknowledgements are made on a separate page, with their own heading. \n In subsequent editions of the book, the foreword is likely to remain unchanged. But the preface may be modified, or complemented by a separate “Preface to the second edition.” \n Dictionary definitions of foreword often make it synonymous with preface, and it seems to have originated that way in C19, amid moves to replace latinate words with home-grown Anglo-Saxon ones. To some users they are synonyms, though, as shown above, those who are involved in the making of books see them as having different functions."

Their distinctiveness can be seen in sets of words like the following: \n antiwar postwar prewar \n inactive proactive retroactive \n Most of the prefixes used in modern English are of classical and especially Latin origin, as are all of those just illustrated. The best known prefixes from Old English are be- as in befriend and un- as in unlikely. \n Prefixes do not usually affect the grammar of the word they are attached to (as suffixes often do). The only prefixes which move words from one grammatical class to another are a- as in awash (verb to adverb), be- as in befriend (noun to verb), and en-/em- as in enable, empower (adjective or noun to verb). Very many others modify the meaning, not the grammar of the word. \n The kinds of meaning added by prefixes can be seen under several headings. There are prefixes of time and order (pre-, post-), of location (sub-, super-), of number (bi-, tri-), and of size or degree (macro-, hyper-). Others express the reversing of an action (de-, dis-), its negation (un-/in-), or a pejorative attitude to it (mal-/mis-). English words may take prefixes from one or two of those groups, but that’s the limit, witness: polyunsaturated, unpremeditated, antidisestablishment. \n Prefixes are generally set solid with the rest of the word. Hyphens appear only when the word attached begins with (1) a capital letter, as with anti-Stalin, or (2) the same vowel as the prefix ends in, as with: \n anti-inflationary de-escalate micro-organism \n Yet in well-established cases of this type, the hyphens become optional, as with cooperate, coordinate and their derivatives.

		"title": "premier or premiere",

Premier is the earlier loan, now an alternative term for “prime minister” in the UK; and in Australia and Canada, a term for the head of an individual state, province or territory. In official titles the word is always capitalized. Compare the Premier of Queensland with the Quebec premier. In sporting contexts the premier(s) are the winning team in the season’s competition: The Panthers are premiers again. The ranking associated with this use of premier is exploited by advertisers in promoting products, as in the premier beer style, Ghana’s premier hotels, the premier wilderness organization in Scotland. \n Premiere (originally premiere) ` is a recent loanword, taken up in artistic circles. It refers to the first performance of a play or musical composition, or the first showing of a newly made film. Increasingly it’s used as a verb, transitive or intransitive:  \n . . . the Grand Theatre Leeds, where the ballet was premiered. . . \n The film premiered in New York this week. \n The use of premiere as a verb dates from 1940, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and there are more than 40 examples in data from the BNC. In CCAE there are hundreds, showing its appeal to entrepreneurs and institutions wanting to add a touch of first-night glamor to whatever they are launching. The usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary (1969–2000) has only gradually accepted the use of premiere as a verb, and is still reluctant to have it applied outside “the entertainment industry.” Do television programs and computer games come under that heading, you may ask. The launch of a new degree program by a college probably doesn’t, and only 25% of the panel accepted the use of of premiere in that context. But useful words have their own momentum. Webster’s English Usage (1989) concludes that the verb premiere has outgrown whatever qualms there have been about it. \n With its new grammatical roles in English, premiere is well assimilated – hence the disappearance of the grave accent from both noun and verb in New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000)."

In American data from CCAE, premise is the only spelling to be found; and BNC writers using premise outnumber those using premiss by more than 10:1. \n The plural form premises, encountered in reference to real estate and legal rights over it, is from exactly the same source. The very different contexts of use mean there’s unlikely to be any confusion, especially when the premises of an argument are abstract, and the premises which are the subject of a lease are concrete – or at least very tangible.

It may serve one of several functions in a clause (see prepositional phrases). \n Many English prepositions double as adverbs, as a glance at the list above would confirm. The similarity in their roles is clear in the following: \n They went up the stairs as the lift was going up. \n (preposition) (adverb) \n The very same word up can be an integral part of the meaning of a verb, as in: \n He ran up a big bill. \n Compare: \n He ran up a big hill. \n In the second sentence, up is an ordinary preposition heading a prepositional phrase (“up a big hill”). In the first, it works as part of a transitive phrasal verb “ran up,” with “a big bill” as the object. (See further under phrasal and prepositional verbs.) \n Other issues with prepositions \n 1 Prepositions and collocations. Convention dictates that certain verbs and related words are followed by particular prepositions/particles. Words like compare/comparison take either with or to, and differ/different may take from, to or than, depending on the context, and which part of the English-speaking world you belong to (see different from). In Britain you fill in a form, whereas in the US you would express it as fill out. Note also the fact that, in American English, no preposition at all is needed with some verbs which do require one in British English. Compare: \n cater for a party (British) - cater a party protest (American) \n against the war (British) - protest the war (American) \n provide us with a plan (British) - provide us a plan (American) \n wrote to his MP (British) - wrote his Congressman (American) \n 2 Ending sentences with prepositions. The prescriptive “rule” that prepositions should never appear at the end of a sentence flows from the idea that they are always “preposed” to a noun/pronoun, as indeed they are in prepositional phrases. It disregards that fact that prepositions can also be semantically attached to verbs, e.g. get off, play up, take on, as we have seen (see further under phrasal and prepositional verbs). This means that they operate in relation to what has gone before rather than what follows (hence the value of calling them particles, which is more neutral than preposition as to the direction of attachment). But the narrow understanding of prepositions led C18 grammarians to think they could never be the last word of a sentence, and their “rule” has been vigorously taught until well on in C20. It obliged writers to recast any sentence with a final preposition so that the offending item appeared earlier in the sentence. Compare: \n Which result were you relying on? \n with \n On which result were you relying? \n And I wonder which train he was waiting for. \n with \n I wonder for which train he was waiting. \n The effect of observing the rule is an overly formal and sometimes unidiomatic sentence. Churchill threw his considerable weight into the scales against it, saying it was “a form of pedantry up with which I will no longer put.” Yet the old rule lives on in some computer grammar checkers. Modern grammarians refer to the final preposition as being stranded; and stranded prepositions occur freely in interrogative and relative clauses, according to the Longman Grammar (1999), in all kinds of discourse except academic prose. As the final word on this issue, we might note that a preposition/particle can make a rather limp ending to a sentence. Still this is a matter of style, not bad grammar."

Compare the forms smiled, walked, discussed, in which the action is set in the past and confined to it. Thus English verbs are said to express either a present or a past tense, the latter being marked by the added -(e)d, or some other change to the simple form. (See further under past tense and principal parts.) \n But in certain contexts the present tense can express both future and past time. See for example: \n My new job starts tomorrow. \n If it rains, they will reschedule the event. \n After all that he reappears with a grin as if nothing had happened. \n In all such sentences, the tense is expressed through something other than the simple verb. In the first sentence, it’s the adverb tomorrow; in the second, the conditional if and the will of the main clause both put rains into the future. In the third, the narrator heightens the drama with the use of reappears, but the other verb makes it clear that the overall context is in the past. This dramatic use of the present tense is known as the “historic present” or the “narrative present.” Note also that the present tense serves to describe ongoing habits and customs, and to make generalizations. For example: \n We go to the markets most Saturdays. \n The boss likes to have flowers in the office. \n The rains come with the changes of season. \n Compound present tenses. In ordinary conversation, and in some kinds of writing, the present continuous rather than the simple present tense may be used to project what is happening here and now: \n After weeks of drought the rain is coming. \n The present continuous creates a span of time in the present, whereas the present perfect marks a moment in it, at which writer and reader can share a retrospective view: \n Now that the storm has passed we can reconnect the computer. \n For more about the continuous and the perfect, see aspect."

		"title": "pressured, pressurized or pressurised",
		"explanation":"American English uses pressured to refer to people under stress, and the verb pressurize for technological applications of pressure, as in pressurized cabin, pressurized water reactor. Yet in recent British English, pressurize/pressurise has come to be used of people under psychological pressure to do something: \n She would not be pressurized to publish things against their judgement \n This human use of pressurized/pressurised was first recorded in 1956 according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and is now freely used alongside pressured. In BNC data, human uses of pressurized/pressurised and pressured are represented in the ratio of about 2:3, whereas in CCAE pressurized still usually means an engineered system. Just occasionally it’s extended to refer to a working context (a competitive, pressurized situation), but rarely applied to the individual.

		"title": "presumptuous or presumptive",
		"explanation":"In the past, these words were occasionally interchanged, but nowadays they are associated with different aspects of the verb presume. Presumptive represents its more neutral sense of being based on a presumption, as in presumptive title and heir presumptive. It occurs much less often than presumptuous, a negatively charged word which represents the sense of “presuming too much” or “taking unwarranted liberties.” \n Presumptuous is sometimes pronounced and spelled “presumptious,” a spelling recorded up to C18 (Oxford Dictionary, 1989), and still fostered by its connection with presumption (see -ious).

(See further under -ce/-se.) As far as meanings go, we might note that pretense/pretence is the abstract noun for the verb pretend when it means “feign, put on,” as in: \n They made a pretence of sympathy. \n Pretension picks up the sense of “lay claim to” which is also part of the scope of pretend: \n He had no pretensions to becoming president. \n Pretentiousness embodies the sense of showing off, either socially or intellectually, pretending to sophistication which isn’t quite there: \n The pretentiousness of his conversation drove his colleagues to despair. \n Still the major dictionaries all allow that pretense/pretence is sometimes used instead of both pretension and pretentiousness, and pretension for pretentiousness.

		"title": "pretty",
		"explanation":"As an adjective this word is uncomplicated. But its status as an adverb as in pretty run down or a pretty good case is still queried – in terms of style rather than grammar. There’s no question that it works as an “amplifier” and “downtoner” (see further under intensifiers and hedge words). But the idea dies hard that pretty as an adverb is somehow “informal.” It bears the label in the New Oxford (1998), although not the Oxford Dictionary (1989), which shows that it has been in literary use since C16. In current British English it occurs freely in everyday factual and interactive writing, judging by the more than 5000 examples in the BNC: \n This is pretty low for speculative investment. \n The exhibition illustrates some pretty horrific mistakes that we made. \n Merriam-Webster (2000) comments that pretty is neither “rare nor wrong in serious discourse,” though “common in informal speech and writing.” Research by authors of the Longman Grammar (1999) shows that pretty is indeed very common in American conversational English, much more so than in British English, by a factor of 4:1. Where Americans say pretty bad/easy/interesting, the British say quite bad/easy/interesting. In American English pretty works as both intensifier and downtoner, whereas British usage seems to make more of the latter (both uses are nevertheless registered in British dictionaries). Having a double role may of course make for ambiguity, which can be a problem as well as a resource. The indeterminacy of pretty as a modifier may well prevent a rush to judgement by speakers or writers, and allow them to negotiate or fine-tune their argument as it develops. This would explain the uses of pretty in both speech and interactive or discursive writing – and its absence from academic texts, according to the Longman Grammar. Pragmatics are at issue rather than style. \n Compare quite."

There is little sign of the gerundial equivalent prevent their contacting the source: see further under gerund and gerundive."

In data from the BNC, preventive still predominates in terms of overall frequency, yet a significant number of texts (40%) use preventative rather than preventive.

		"title": "prima donna, diva and prima ballerina",
		"explanation":"In Italian prima donna means “first lady,” though it’s associated with the operatic stage rather than the White House. The term was and is given to the principal female singer in an opera company, though it’s now also applied to a temperamental, conceited and autocratic person of either sex. In fact those negative connotations are on record from mid-C19, and probably help to explain the arrival in the 1880s of diva, another Italian loanword for a great female singer, meaning literally “goddess” and still a term which registers admiration. \n In English both prima donna and diva are pluralized in the regular way with s, though the Italian plurals prime donne and dive are sometimes used for their foreign cachet. Perhaps they help to bypass the negative associations of prima donna, which are now firmly built into the English language in derivative words such as prima donna-ish and prima donna-ism. \n A prima ballerina is the matching term in a ballet company identifying the leading female dancer, or one of the highest rank. The only title above that is prima ballerina assoluta, a title so rarefied it was only given twice in the history of the ballet. The expression prima ballerina is normally given an English plural, helped by the fact that the word ballerina itself is pluralized that way. Yet prima ballerina too is developing more general senses. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) records both “important or self-important person” and “leading item in its field,” both since 1950. It also recognizes the Italian plural prime ballerine, which here again may serve to designate outstanding dancers, and distinguish them from leading persons or items in other fields."

Similarly it’s used in scholarly argument of data which looks significant but requires further investigating.

		"title": "principal or principle",
		"explanation":"Most adults cope with one-syllable homophones such as cede and seed, but three-syllabled ones like principal/principle get the better of many. The words do however differ in meaning and function, and we can thus distinguish them. \n Principal is an adjective borrowed from Latin meaning “chief, most important.” It has acquired many more meanings as a noun in English, in reference to the head of a school or college, the leader of a section of an orchestra, and those who are the key agents in a law case. In law it refers to the real assets of an estate (as opposed to the income they earn), and it’s used more generally in financial calculations, to distinguish the capital sum from any interest or profit associated with it. \n Principle is an abstract word meaning “rule” or “formative characteristic,” as in: \n Those groups work on a principle of collaboration. \n The underlying principle of the design is inspired. \n Because principle is an abstract, there are modifiers before and/or after it to specify its meaning. This helps to distinguish it from principal as a noun, whose meaning is specific enough in most contexts to need no elaborating. \n The problem with these words arises from the fact that English preserves the word principle and certain others in forms which were peculiar to northern French and Anglo-Norman (see -le section 3). The standard French for principle is “principe,” which does not make a homophone for principal."

Although it’s customary to give three principal parts, this is only essential for irregular verbs. Most regular verbs have just two distinct forms: e.g. laugh (present) and laughed (past), because the past participle is identical with the ordinary past tense. See further under irregular verbs."

		"title": "prise or prize",
		"explanation":"These spellings represent quite a clutch of different words, both nouns and verbs. In British, Canadian and Australian English the verb prise (“lever off ”) is distinct from the verb prize (“value greatly”). The noun is always prize, whether it refers to a special award, or to something captured by strenuous effort. In the US the first verb is usually spelled prize as well – which is a straightforward way out of the problem of knowing which spelling to use for which meaning. It coincides also with the standard American use of -ize in the choice between civilize/civilise etc. (See further under -ize/-ise.) \n The use of prize for the noun is itself an amalgamation of two once separate words – extensions of different roots. The sense of “special award” comes from the medieval “pris” and Latin pretium (which also gives us price); and the sense of “something captured” is from “prise,” part of the French verb meaning “seize” (the source of the English verb prise). Meanwhile the verb prize (“value greatly”) is an alternative form of the word praise, based on Old French preisier/prisier. \n While prize is the regular American spelling for all the nouns and verbs mentioned above, pry occasionally serves as an alternative for the verb “lever off.” See further under pry."

		"explanation":"English embraces both older and newer uses of this Latin prefix-cum-preposition. As a prefix it means “forward” or “in front of [in time or space],” as in: \n proceed progress project promote propose \n In these old loanwords pro- is always set solid. \n Another older use of pro- is to mean “substitute for,” which has come down in words such as proconsul and pronoun, and has generated new formations such as pro-vice-chancellor. New words formed this way are hyphenated. \n A similar but recent use of pro- is to be found in words like pro-American, pro-communist, pro-Israel, where it means “in favor of.” In such words it’s always hyphenated, whether the following item bears a capital letter or not. This meaning corresponds quite closely to one associated with pro as a preposition in Latin – which perhaps explains both the hyphen and the fact that they can be formed ad hoc with almost any raw material: pro-daylight saving. \n Pro has additional roles as an independent word in English. In pros and cons it refers to arguments in favor of a proposition, a direct use of the Latin preposition. Note that pro also stands as an abbreviation for two English words: (1) professional and (2) prostitute."

Yet BNC evidence shows that British writers are more inclined to use it for the adverb (as in the first example), and make equal use of the hyphened form (pro-rata) for the adjective.

Data from texts in the BNC and CCAE provide thousands of examples of Professor and only a few hundred of Prof(.) in each case. The two do not usually appear in the same text (with Prof[.] abbreviating an earlier use of Professor). Instead the academic title/name is abbreviated in the same way as in letters: from Professor David Stuart (or David Stuart, Professor of Engineering) to Professor Stuart. Initials are rarely found with the title in running text. Note that the second style with title following is likely to be fully capitalized in British English, and lower-cased (professor of engineering) in American English. When Prof(.) is used to save space or avoid formality, the use/non-use of a stop goes with one’s general policy on abbreviations (see abbreviations options a–d).

		"title": "program or programme",
		"explanation":"Program is the standard spelling in the US for all uses of the word. In the UK program is reserved by many for computer uses, and programme applied in all other contexts. In fact program was endorsed by the original Oxford Dictionary on two grounds: \n 1 Program was the earlier spelling, used in the word’s first recorded appearances in (Scottish) English in C17, while the spelling programme made its appearance in C19. (We may speculate on whether it was motivated by the desire to “improve” the Scots form or to “frenchify” it – or both. See further under -e.) \n 2 Program is analogous with anagram, diagram, histogram, radiogram, telegram etc., while there are no analogues for programme. Fowler quietly endorsed those points in 1926, but his reviser Gowers (1965) made haste to affirm the British preference for programme – which suggests that it may have crystallized only by mid-century. Yet in BNC data, approximately one third of all uses of program are not computer-related, raising the question as to whether the British preference is beginning to change (or never was as firm a distinction as has been claimed). In Canada, programme is used by the federal government to embrace French interests, whereas Canadians more generally use program, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). Australian government style has endorsed program for all purposes since the 1960s. \n When program serves as a verb, the final mis normally doubled before suffixes, as in programmed, programming and in programmer. In the US the words are sometimes spelled with a single m, but this is not very common, even though it conforms to more general American habits of spelling. The fact that the second syllable is a separable unit may help to explain why. See further under doubling of final consonant."

In American English propellant is also the dominant spelling, outnumbering propellent by more than 20:1 in data from CCAE. Again it serves for noun (a propellant in aerosol cans) as well as adjective (solid-propellant booster rockets). The only uses of propellent were nouns, pace Merriam-Webster (2000) and New Oxford (1998), which suggest that it survives for the adjective.

Note that in the third case, the proper name consists of common words combined with a proper noun: Canterbury (see nouns). Proper names can consist entirely of common words, as in Northern Territory. The uniqueness of the designation makes it a proper name, not the words combined in it. \n Proper names – personal, geographical and institutional – are normally distinguished by capital letters on every component except the function words. (So words like the, and, of are not capitalized.) However institutional names often shed their capitals when used repeatedly and in abbreviated form in any piece of writing. See further under capital letters section 3."

Thus we write: \n We have three Davids on the staff here. \n Although reusable proper nouns are not listed with the common nouns in dictionaries, they do have some general kinds of meaning which could be specified. For example, the name Eric is male and Anglo-Saxon, and Paola is female and Italian. Compare Mitsuhiro and Masumi, whose gender is unclear to those who know no Japanese.

This division of labor parallels the one written into pairs such as advice/advise (see further under-ce/-se). However it is less established in American English than British. Webster’s Third (1986) allows either word to stand instead of the other, and in data from CCAE more than half the examples of prophesy are nouns, as in: biblical prophesy, a self-fulfilling prophesy.

		"explanation":"These adjectives both mean “being in proportion,” and there’s little to choose between them – except that proportionate normally appears after the noun, as in profits proportionate to our investment, but not before it. Proportional is more versatile, and could appear either after or before the noun: compare proportional representation with representation proportional to population. Another small point of difference is that proportional seems to express precise numerical ratios, whereas those in proportionate are more impressionistic. This second point also emerges when we compare their opposite forms: disproportional points out a disparity in numbers, whereas disproportionate suggests a more general lack of proportion."

Yet the extra syllable and latinate form of proposition makes it the more formal choice, and coincides with the fact that proposal is definitely the more common of the two, by a ratio of about 3:1 in the BNC. The more formal character of proposition has been reinforced by its use in scholarly contexts, especially in mathematics and logic. Yet new idiomatic uses of proposition are increasing its popularity, witness a commercial proposition, an exciting proposition, a different proposition altogether. In phrases like those, applied to anything from the new motel, to a tempting holiday package, to the freshly signed-up football star, proposition becomes a faintly pretentious synonym for “prospect” or “venture.” Proposal retains its basic link with the verb propose. \n Another remarkable development is the C20 development of proposition as a verb, meaning “seek sexual intercourse with.” A similar sense is now also attached to the noun, contrasting dramatically with proposal – which is always associated with the proposing of marriage."

In the southern hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) the proprietary company is a private, limited company, indicated by the contraction Pty, as in Computer Systems Pty Ltd.

		"title": "prostrate or prostate",
		"explanation":" These two are not to be confused, as in “prostrate troubles.” Prostate refers to a gland in the male genital organs, whose malfunction in later life may require a prostate operation. Prostrate is an adjective meaning “lying collapsed on the ground.” In that sense it covers both prone (“lying face downwards”) and supine (“lying flat on one’s back”). Yet dictionaries all show that the meaning of prostrate is closer to prone than supine, and that it can be a synonym for the former but not the latter. \n The difference between prostrate and supine also comes out in their figurative uses, describing how groups of people behave in the face of powerful forces. Prostrate involves total submission and surrender, as in: \n the triumphant dictation of terms to a prostrate enemy \n Supine suggests inertness or failure to resist pressure, as in: \n a supine and cowardly press . . . intimidated into censoring the truth \n Thus prostrate implies that the power is not to be resisted, whereas supine implies that it should have been."

		"title": "protagonist and antagonist",
		"explanation":"These Greek loanwords have been reinterpreted in English so that they complement each other. Modern uses of pro- and anti- support the notion of protagonist as “one who fights for something” and antagonist as “one who fights against something” (see further under ante-/anti- and pro-). But those with a knowledge of Greek, including Fowler and the editors of the original Oxford Dictionary, found this very unsatisfactory because the protagonist was the leading actor (literally “first actor”) in a Greek drama. Fowler therefore claimed that the word could not be made plural (since there was only one protagonist in the original context); and he argued that using the adjective “chief ” with it (as in chief protagonist) was tautologous. They are issues for the cognoscenti. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) overruled his first point and allowed protagonists in the plural, while insisting that the word be applied to leaders and prominent people only. Yet in BNC data, the protagonists are often the unnamed adherents of a cause, as in the nuclear protagonists’ case or protagonists of the warm-blooded theory (of dinosaurs). The New Oxford (1998) defines protagonist as “leader” as well as “advocate or champion of a cause or idea,” noting that this is now widely accepted in standard English. Other dictionaries, both British and American, enter it without any hint of the controversy. \n The fact that people nowadays interpret protagonist as embodying pro- (the Latin prefix meaning “in support of ”) is not something to lament or condemn. It confirms that common knowledge of Latin word elements in English is much stronger than the knowledge of Greek – and that people like to make sense of the words they use."

		"title": "protector or protecter",
		"explanation":"This word might look like an English formation based on protect (and therefore to be spelled with -er: see -er/-or). It was in fact borrowed from French in C14.

		"title": "protest",
		"explanation":"Everywhere in the English-speaking world, the verb protest can be construed transitively as well as intransitively (i.e. with or without a direct object: see further under transitive). \n 1 protest one’s innocence \n 2 protest that it would spoil the landscape \n 3 protest against the war \n 4 protest at their disregard for the facts \n The third collocation protest against usually implies an organized public protest, whereas the fourth (protest at) is more likely to be the voice of an individual. Protest about and protest over are also occasionally found. All four constructions are used in American and British English, yet Americans often use transitive constructions for the third and fourth types as well. For example: \n Civilians on the outskirts of the capital protested French intervention. \n Transitive constructions like these appear far more often than ones with against and at, in data from CCAE. They are frequent in news and sports reporting (protest the game/race), and support a passive construction: their arrival was protested by the mayor, which gets into headlines as Arrival Protested. The grammar of protest is thus more flexible in American English than British. It includes the intransitive, but emphasizes the transitive side of the verb. In British English the intransitive uses are still to the fore."

		"title": "Protestant",
		"explanation":"This term (with a capital P) refers to any of the churches which detached themselves from the Catholic Church of Rome at the time of the Reformation. The name was first used of the German princes who spoke out against the counter-Reformation statements of Speyer in 1529. It was then applied to the churches led by Luther and Calvin, and to the Church of England. Further Protestant churches were formed in Britain in the next two centuries, detaching themselves from the established Church of England. Dissenting churches, the Methodists, and Presbyterians are therefore also known as Nonconformist churches. In the US the largest nonconformist churches (upper or lower case) are the Southern Baptist Convention, Uniting Methodists, Lutherans, the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ, and the Mormons. \n Note that the term Protestant is not used of the Eastern Orthodox churches, which detached themselves from the Church of Rome about AD 1054."

		"title": "proto-",
		"explanation":"This Greek prefix means “first in time” or “original.” In English it has developed out of words such as protoplast and prototype, and provided the initial element for many new scientific terms of C19, especially in zoology, biology and chemistry. These were followed by a spate of words with proto- in the humanities and social sciences. Some are generic terms such as protoculture, protohistory, protosyntax, while others refer to a specific early culture or language: \n proto-Baroque, proto-Renaissance \n Proto-Australian, Proto-Indo-European \n Proto-Romance \n As the examples show, the prefix is capitalized when it forms part of the name of a hypothetical original language, but in lower case when it refers to an early or primitive form of a given culture.

Their position is strongly supported by data from the BNC, where the first (as past participle) outnumbers the second by almost 10:1. In American data from CCAE, the ratio is more like 5:2, but still clearly in favor of proved. Americans use proven in active as well as passive constructions: has proven impossible, yet to be proven; and there are examples of both in the BNC, though active constructions are definitely in the minority. All this challenges the claim made in some British style guides that proven is the American form – as does the fact that British and American writers both use proven for the participial adjective, in phrases such as proven ability, and legal formulas such as not proven, proven guilty."

Fowler (1926) preferred provided (that), and British writers represented in the BNC endorse it over providing (that) by more than 2:1. In American English from CCAE, the ratio is about 3:1. Both constructions are more often used without the following that than with it, and when placed at the start of a sentence or after a comma they are unlikely to be misread as parts of the verb provide. The second example above would benefit by a comma if the following that is to be omitted. Most style commentators agree that these phrases are heavyweight ways of prefacing a condition. If that is the effect you’re seeking, they serve the purpose. Otherwise if serves for a positive condition, and unless for a negative one."

		"explanation":"These adjectives recognize very different aspects of human character. Prudent implies wisdom and shrewdness, and respect for them in the person or plan credited with them. Prudish implies a narrow concern with the conventions of modesty and morality and a tendency to disapprove of others who are more liberal in this regard. \n The similarity between the two words suggests a common basis of meaning, but it’s deceptive. Prudent has a straightforward history going back to an identical Latin adjective meaning “wise.” Prudish has come to us by a devious route through French. It uses the clipped form (prude) of French prudefemme, meaning “proud or worthy woman,” with the English suffix -ish added to make it an adjective. Evidently a certain irony has contributed to its sense development."

Neither the British nor Australians make much use of the second. \n Pry in the second sense is believed to be a backformation from prise – where the third person singular present of the verb – pries – suggested a base form pry. (Compare flies/fly.) The same kind of backformation has contributed several nouns to English (see under false plurals). The origin of pry (“look inquisitively”) is unknown. \n The noun for “one who pries” (in either sense of the word) is spelled prier, whatever dictionary you consult. But there are no examples in either BNC or CCAE to support the point, and we might otherwise expect it to be the more regular form pryer. Compare drier and flyer."

But its productive life as an English prefix takes off in C19, in countless new formations. At first they are mostly scholarly, and in biological nomenclature pseudo- is used in a relatively neutral way to refer to organs which have a function other than the one you might expect (e.g. pseudocarp), or a species which resembles another though it’s unrelated to it (pseudoscorpion). \n nother though it’s unrelated to it (pseudoscorpion). In other disciplines pseudo- has negative connotations, and points to the falseness of appearances, as in pseudoclassic and pseudoscience. It is freely used in ad hoc pejorative words and phrases such as pseudo-charm, pseudo-marble walls. In examples like the latter, pseudo can appear as an independent adjective (pseudo marble walls), and is recognized in that role in both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000). Pseudo is also listed as a noun (“an insincere person”), although the clipped form pseud, as in the ultimate pseud, is now the more common form in database evidence. \n The abbreviation pseud. represents pseudonym in bibliographies.

Pukka is by far the commonest spelling in data from CCAE and the BNC, and prioritized in Merriam-Webster (2000) as well as New Oxford (1998) – though the latter also lists pukkah. Pucka was the primary spelling in C19, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Any of them serves to distinguish the word from the very different pucker, meaning “crease, wrinkle”: \n . . . pucker the top of the bag \n The pink lips slide from wide smile to pucker. \n In fact, the grammar of pucker as a verb/noun sets it apart from the Anglo-Indian adjective – so it too can be spelled pucker, as in the exclusive Pucker Gallery in Boston."

		"title": "punctuation",
		"explanation":"The English punctuation system has evolved in tandem with the traditions of writing and printing. Some elements of punctuation go back to medieval manuscripts, but their shapes and uses varied until well into C17, and were formalized only in C18. The contribution of space to the punctuation system (e.g. word space, space between sentences) has only recently been recognized. The punctuation marks which appear in modern English are as follows: \n ∗ for sentence punctuation \n brackets/parentheses, colon, \n comma, ellipsis, \n em rule / em dash, \n en rule / en dash, \n exclamation mark,  full stop / period, \n question mark, quotation marks, \n semicolon \n ∗ for word punctuation \n acute apostrophe cedilla \n circumflex dieresis grave \n ha´cek hyphen solidus/slash /n tilde umlaut \n For more about each, see under individual headings. There are regional differences in the use of brackets, colon, comma, ellipsis, quotation marks; as well as the apostrophe, hyphen, solidus; and the stop in abbreviated words (see abbreviations). \n Note also the increasing use of sets of bullets, arrows or other devices to mark items in vertical lists. (See bullets.) \n 1. Developments in punctuation. Not all the punctuation marks listed above are used regularly, and the use of even the most essential ones has varied since C18. Punctuation marks were sprinkled much more liberally through books published a century ago than nowadays. “Lighter” punctuation is the taste of our times in continuous prose; and in business letter writing there’s a growing preference for “open” rather than “closed” punctuation (see Appendix VII for examples of each). Less punctuation means fewer keystrokes for the keyboarder, and less time and effort in the production of the day’s letters. \n 2 Punctuation and sentence grammar. Punctuation interacts with the grammar of sentences, marking off separate grammatical units within them (e.g. quotations, parentheses), and always marks the end of the sentence. Punctuation marks used to be placed to coincide with almost every phrase of a Victorian novel – and served their purpose, amid the intricate and typically longer sentences of the time. Less complex, shorter sentences can be read comfortably with less internal punctuation. It is still vital for presenting itemized material in vertical lists, as in computer manuals designed for print or screen reading. The items can be marked either by conventional punctuation or a combination of bullets and space (see lists). \n The correlation between punctuation and sentence elements is otherwise only occasional. An adverbial phrase at the start of a sentence may or may not require a comma after it, depending on its length. Commas may be used with nonrestrictive/ nondefining relative clauses, but are not the only factor that distinguishes them from restrictive/ defining clauses (see further under relative clauses). \n 3 Punctuation, speaking and information delivery. Some people associate punctuation with the sound and rhythm of sentences, and see it as a substitute for the stress, rhythm and pausing of living speech. Yet the ordinary patterns of stress and sentence rhythms have to be created by the writer’s flow of words. Words needing particular stress are sometimes underlined or italicized – thus going outside the standard punctuation system. Punctuation mostly correlates with the larger pauses within and between sentences, though not quite as systematically as was thought by C18 writers, who saw the comma, semicolon, colon and full stop as representing increasingly long pauses in sentences. We still regard the comma, (semi)colon and full stop as representing small, medium and large breaks in the structure of sentences (see further under colon and semicolon). Ideally they are placed at points where readers can safely pause, because of a break or boundary in the structure of information. \n Punctuation serves to pace the visual delivery of information, not to control its oral performance. Research by Chafe (1987) showed that readers given punctuated texts always added their own prosodic breaks when reading it aloud. The punctuation supplied was never quite sufficient to the task. \n 4 Meaning in punctuation. Punctuation is at bottom a device for separating and/or linking items in the continuous line of writing. Many punctuation marks do both at once. Commas often separate one phrase from the next, yet they show that the two belong to the same sentence. Hyphens link the two parts of a compound, but also ensure that the boundary between them is obvious to the reader. Research shows that punctuation works best in supporting distinctions which are already there for the reader in the words, and cannot really “create” ones which are not already felt. \n Punctuation is essentially neutral, and cannot express a writer’s attitude unambiguously. Exclamation marks attached to a particular statement could mean that the writer is either shocked or excited by it. The use of “scare quotes” is similarly ambiguous (see quotation marks section 1). For ways of resolving the problem when two different punctuation marks coincide in the same place, see multiple punctuation."

		"title": "pundit or pandit",
		"explanation":"This Hindi loanword, originally pandita, means “wise man, scholar,” and in the form pandit it is still a title of honor, witness Pandit Nehru. The pronunciation of the word by Indians makes it sound to English ears like “pundit”; and pundit is the spelling attached to the extended use of the word in English, when it refers to ad hoc experts, as in political pundit, fashion pundit, or those attached to a particular medium: TV pundit, Washington Post pundit. Given this somewhat undiscriminating use of pundit, it’s preferable to use pandit whenever the older meaning of the word is intended."

		"title": "puns",
		"explanation":"A pun is a play on words, invoking the meaning of two (or more) at once for humorous effect. Though sometimes called the “lowest form of wit,” it all depends on the quality of the pun. Shakespeare used puns to add allusive dimensions to his dialogue, and contemporary news reporters engage their readers with puns in headlines. A nice example to head an article on the aristocratic pursuit of gardening was HAUGHTY CULTURE. Advertisers exploit the pun in the naming of products, and help them to linger in the mind, witness ABSCENT for a deodorant, and RAINDEERS for plastic shoe protectors used in the snow belt of North America. As the examples show, a written pun commits itself to one meaning by the spelling, and has to rely on the context (verbal/visual/situational) to raise the other."

It can also be used as a noun: Don’t be such a puritan. A capital letter is added in historical references to the Puritan Revolution (and individual Puritans).

It often relates to small, everyday events: He purposely kept the memo out of N’s hands. Its opposite is accidentally. \n Purposefully usually implies movement toward a preconceived goal: Moran drove purposefully. Its opposite is aimlessly. \n Purposively is a more academic word than either of the others, popularized by the theory of “purposivism” a century ago – the idea that the behavior of an individual or organism is always directed toward an end, and is not random: \n The elements of structure have to behave purposively, working at and overcoming basic human problems. \n In purposively the perspective is detached, sociological or behavioristic, whereas both purposely and purposefully are mentalistic.

In late C20 English it has been updated to include any kind of capitalism without commercial privilege. One may be purveyor of anything from coffee and pizza, to detergents and “insurance-related products.” But the newest uses of the word are more figurative: from purveyor of movies galore and unlimited entertainment, to Hollywood as purveyor of dreams, and from purveyor of gossip to that of wild and new paradoxes. Creative uses like these abound in both American and British English, by the evidence of both CCAE and the BNC – though they may be quite recent, given the lack of comment in either Oxford Dictionary (1989) or Webster’s Third (1986). Figurative use is now acknowledged in New Oxford (1998), and embraced by the definition “one who purveys” in Merriam-Webster (2000). In fact the verb purvey has long been used figuratively, and we may yet see a revival of the English spelling purveyer (obsolescent since C17, according to the Oxford) to confirm the lively link with the verb."

Pigmy was used in earlier English up to C16, when its Greek antecedent pygme was built back into the spelling by Renaissance spelling reformers (see spelling, rules and reforms section 1). However pigmy continued to be used, by the numerous citations in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and the two spellings have coexisted, like other i/y pairs (see under i/y). \n Amid C20 concerns over racist language (explicit and implicit) pigmy has seemed both unfortunate and linguistically misleading. It suggests animal connections where the word’s origins should be found in a Greek unit of length (the pygme was a measure from the elbow to the knuckles, rather like a cubit). Both Oxford and Webster’s Third (1986) prefer the spelling pygmy for etymological reasons, and usage generally seems to have swung behind it. It affects all uses of the word, whether in reference to one of the Bushman people of Equatorial Africa, or figurative applications such as an intellectual pygmy; or adjectival uses for a dwarf species of plant or animal, as in pygmy pine, pygmy goat, pygmy kingfisher. When used of the people, the word should bear a capital letter as in a Congo Pygmy chief (see capital letters section 1). The plural of the noun is Pygmies."

In Canada both spellings are used, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). \n The spelling pajamas is slightly closer to the word’s origins in Hindi pajama, based on a Persian word meaning “leg garment.” Yet having adapted the word’s meaning so that it now refers to a garment for the whole body, we lose part of the argument for keeping the original spelling."

The qu combination was also used by Anglo-Norman scribes before 1300 to respell Old English words beginning with cw. Its effects can be seen in quake, qualm, queen, quell, quick, quoth and others.

Fowler (1926) argued that the construction should only be used when qua identified a precise element of some larger notion; otherwise as was “quite sufficient.” Some commentators, extrapolating from this, have argued that qua could not be used between repeated nouns, as in the third example. Yet even there, qua solicits a different take on the repeated word, and so functions implicitly according to Fowler’s prescription. In the second example above, the move is more explicit, with the simple noun following qua making only a partial match for the noun phrase before it. Constructions involving repeated nouns are much more common in BNC data than those without them (like the first example). In North American data reported by Webster’s English Usage (1989) and Canadian English Usage (1997), qua was also most commonly found between matching nouns, as in the third construction. \n The natural context for qua is academic discourse and closely reasoned argument.

		"explanation":"This is the Latin prefix for “four,” a component of loanwords and neoclassical formations such as: \n quadrangle quadrennial quadrillion \n quadrophonic quadruped \n The examples show that the vowel immediately after quadr- is not to be taken for granted. In some words it comes from the stem following, e.g. -ennial, -illion, and with stress on that syllable, the spelling is fixed. But those with stress on the first and third syllables (like quadrophonic) have at least two possible spellings, because the vowel of the second syllable varies in pronunciation. Is it quadracycle or quadricycle? Quadraplegic, quadriplegic or quadruplegic? Quadrasonic, quadrisonic or quadrosonic? The various different spellings are recognized in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and any of them would correspond to the common pronunciation. The point to note is that the spelling with i is possible in each case, and indeed the favorite for quadriplegic, by the evidence of BNC and CCAE. For quadraphony (or is it quadrophony? ) the spelling depends on whether you stress the first or second syllable. \n Note that mathematical words such as quadrilateral, quadrinomial, quadrivalent are all standardized with i,in Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary."

		"title": "quandary or quandry",
		"explanation":"The origin of this word meaning “practical dilemma” is itself a puzzle. It appears in Renaissance English, and looks as latinate as its contemporaries quantum, quorum, quota, but with no obvious antecedent. \n Earlier on, quandary was pronounced with stress on the second syllable, but it was moving forward in C18, promoting the two-syllabled pronunciation which is given priority in some dictionaries. Others such as New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) make it an equal alternative. The three-syllabled spelling (quandary) is still the only one recognized, although Webster’s English Usage (1989) reports examples of quandry from 1950 and 1980. Both BNC and CCAE provide a handful more, suggesting that it may be on the increase, while quandary remains the dominant spelling. For Samuel Johnson (1755) quandary was “a low word,” and still it seems to be at home in everyday interactive writing, not formal prose."

		"title": "quango or NGO",
		"explanation":"These latter-day abbreviations may both be defined as “nongovernment organization,” but their applications and connotations are quite different. Quango originated in the US in the 1960s, as a blend of quasi nongovernment organization, and within a decade was being used in the UK. The interplay between the first two elements of the phrase has always been equivocal, since the British quango enjoyed government funding and served to further government policy in specialized areas. By 1976 the word quango was being explained as quasi autonomous national government organization – shifting the emphasis onto its relative independence from the bureaucracy. The word is still rather derogatory, according to New Oxford (1998), especially if you feel the quango is an unnecessary institution where “failed members of parliament serve on inflated salaries,” as one MP put it. Derivatives such as quangocrat and quangocracy express the same feeling. \n Much less contentious is NGO, a 1990s abbreviation for the nongovernment organization funded by churches or charitable organizations, for example Oxfam, Amnesty International, Community Aid Abroad. It works in foreign countries to assist refugees and other needy people. \n While quango is an acronym, NGO is pronounced as an initialism (see under acronyms).

		"title": "quantum leap or jump",
		"explanation":"The expression quantum jump was coined by scientists in the 1920s, as a way of describing the way electrons can abruptly change their state. Quantum leap is its common paraphrase, used since 1955 to mean a “sudden large increase or advance” in any sphere of life (Webster’s English Usage, 1989). In data from CCAE and the BNC, there are quantum leaps in productivity / police powers / our cultural and artistic range / the delivery of government policy, as well as very specific fields such as microscopy, video games and rug-making. As the latter examples show, the phrase risks turning itself into a clich´e. Popular use of quantum leap seems to have impacted back on quantum jump, so that it too is used rhetorically on its occasional appearances in nonscientific writing. Quantum leap is still commoner by far in American and British data – which may be cold comfort to scientists."

Quay itself was a Celtic loanword, cognate with the word for “fence” in Cornish (ke) and Breton (cai), and spelled key or kay in Middle English. The same word in French was/is quai, and the anglicized equivalent quay makes its debut in Edward Phillips’s New World of English Words of 1696.

		"title": "question marks",
		"explanation":"A question mark at the end of a string of words indicates that they form a question, or should be read as one: \n Did you see the advertisement? \n He hasn’t come yet? \n The word order of the first sentence (with subject following the auxiliary verb) sets it up as a question. But the second sentence becomes a question only through the mark at the end. If spoken, it would of course be marked as a question through rising intonation. \n In the same way, the absence of a question mark from an inverted sentence shows that it is not intended as a question, but as a request, invitation or instruction: \n Could I use your phone. \n Won’t you come in. \n Would you close the door. \n A question mark might perhaps be used in the first of those, if the writer wanted to emphasize the politeness of the request, and the fact that the response was not taken for granted. In the second and third cases, the invitation/instruction assumes compliance and is not up for negotiation. Note that question marks are used only with direct questions, not indirect questions. Compare: \n Where were you last night? \n They asked where you were last night. \n Question marks are occasionally used in mid-sentence, beside a date which is uncertain – Chaucer b. ?1340 – or after a word whose use is questionable. The first is an accepted practice; the second one casts a shadow of doubt on the writer’s verbal competence, and should be avoided in a finished MS. \n Other punctuation with question marks. The question mark takes the place of a period/stop at the end of a sentence. If there are quotation marks or parentheses it stands inside them, unless it belongs strictly to the carrier sentence. Compare: \n She asked “Who are you?” \n  Did I hear him say “an old friend”? \n Where can I find guitar recordings (classical)? \n It’s in that tourist pamphlet (What’s on in Barcelona?). \n In cases like the last (but not the first) it’s usual to close the sentence with a period/stop. (See further under multiple punctuation.) \n Double question marks (??), or combinations of exclamation and question marks (!? or ?!), are to be avoided except in informal writing (and in chess). Where they might appear on either side of closing quotation marks (because one belongs to the quote, and the other to the carrier sentence), the sentence should be rearranged to avoid it. Perhaps the interrobang will one day solve that problem of needing two punctuation marks at once. See further under interrobang."

		"title": "questions",
		"explanation":"A question is an interactive means of establishing the facts. Through questions we elicit information from others, or ask them to affirm or negate a fact which we ourselves supply. The only questions which do not work by interaction are rhetorical questions. Those who utter them in the course of a monologue mean to provide the answer themselves, and the question form is simply a way of securing the audience’s attention. \n  Information-seeking questions are also known as wh-questions because they’re introduced by interrogative words such as who, when, where, why: \n Who were you talking to? \n When will the party begin? \n Where should we all meet? \n Why are you waiting here? \n Note that how also counts among the interrogative words, and that it too introduces open-ended wh-questions. \n 2 Questions which seek an affirmative or negative answer are known as yes/no questions or polar questions (see polarity). They are often expressed through inversion of the subject and auxiliary, as in: \n Have you finished yet? \n Were you thinking of lunch? \n Alternatively, a yes/no question may take the form of an ordinary statement rounded off with a question mark at the end: \n The show can go on? \n They won’t start without us? \n In conversation, questions like these would be accompanied by rising intonation. \n 3 Tag questions serve to underscore the subject and verb of the main question, picking up the subject through the appropriate pronoun, and the verb through its auxiliary. \n The show can go on, can’t it? \n They won’t start without us, will they? \n If there’s no auxiliary verb, do is recruited for the purpose: \n You like the program, don’t you? \n Note that the tag question usually has opposite polarity to that of the main question – negative when it’s positive, and vice versa. (See further under polarity.) \n 4 Direct and indirect questions. All the types of questions mentioned so far are direct questions, i.e. they are expressed as they would be in real interaction with those who supply the answer. At one stage removed are indirect questions, ones which report a question through the words of another party: \n They asked where we should all meet. \n They queried why we were waiting. \n They questioned whether the show would go on. \n Indirect questions differ from direct ones in that they use regular subject/verb word order. Note that they may adjust the pronouns (turning the second person you into first or third person), and modify the tense of the verb. In the examples above a past tense is used following the past tense of the main verb, even though it would have been present tense in the direct question. (See further under sequence of tenses.) No question mark is used with indirect questions."

		"title": "quid pro quo",

The plural is normally quid pro quos, not the Latin quae pro quo. (See plurals section 2.) \n The phrase probably gave rise to the slang word quid, a unit of money which varies with the context in which it’s used. In C17 it meant a guinea, and after that a pound. In Australia it’s now translated into dollars, although it does not pretend to be an exact amount: \n Can you lend me a couple of quid? \n As that example shows, the plural is often the same as the singular."

But database evidence shows that quitted is rare to the point of extinction in most places. In British data from the BNC, quitted is outnumbered by past uses of quit in the ratio of 1:16, and it’s “extremely rare” in Canada (Canadian English Usage, 1997). There’s no trace of quitted in American data from CCAE, or the Australian ACE (Peters, 1995). \n While the verb quit goes back to C13, quitted makes its appearance only in C17.

		"title": "quite",
		"explanation":"This word is used freely in the US and the UK, but regional differences are there just below the surface. In British English quite is the all-purpose qualifier. It can be an intensifier, reinforcing the following word as in quite right, or a hedge word that tones it down, as in quite well. The first sense (“completely”) tends to go with absolute words (see absolute section 1), the second (“rather”) with those that are gradable and comparable. With verbs the distinction is usually clear cut: compare I quite forgot with I quite enjoyed the meeting. Yet there are many adjectives in which either sense could apply. If something is quite original, is it brilliantly innovative, or just modestly creative? If quite dangerous, should you proceed with caution, or take evasive action? In conversation quite takes on other roles as well. It draws casual attention to a noun, as in quite a shock, and also serves as an emphatic response: Quite so or just Quite! These contrasting uses mean that quite is often ambiguous, though this very ambiguity lends itself to the dynamics of conversation. In data from the BNC, quite is disproportionately represented in spoken texts, where it occurs about three times as often as in written texts. \n In American English quite is much less frequently used in conversation, according to research reported in the Longman Grammar (1999). American use of quite also differs in that the absolute meaning can be associated even with gradable adjectives, as noted in the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). This is the root of some misunderstanding, since Americans who use quite interesting to mean “very interesting” are probably heard by the British as saying “rather interesting.” \n Both British and American writers use quite in academic and informative prose to fine-tune their stance, and underscore a view, as in quite likely/properly/rightly. Latent ambiguities and regional differences in the use of quite tend to be neutralized as the writer develops the discussion. \n ♦ For other less ambiguous qualifiers, see intensifiers and hedge words."

		"title": "quotation marks",
		"explanation":"The common term for the pairs of aerial commas which mark quotations is quotation marks, or less formally quote marks or just quotes, the last being freely used among editors (Copy-editing, 1992). In the UK the alternative term inverted commas has enjoyed some popularity, but its use is now declining (see inverted commas). Quotation marks raise a number of punctuation issues, such as the choice between double and single quotes, and where to locate other punctuation marks in relation to them (see below, sections 2 and 3). \n 1 Uses of quotation marks. Quote marks identify the words actually uttered or written by someone. They appear at the start and finish of the quoted string of words, except when the quotation runs to several paragraphs. Then the quote marks appear just at the beginning of each paragraph, until the last one, which has them at both beginning and end. Note that no quotation marks at all are needed for block quotations, which are indented and set apart typographically, in a smaller or different typeface. \n Quotation marks are often less than essential in separating quoted from nonquoted material. Some famous writers do without them altogether in the articulation of dialogue – including James Joyce, who called them “perverted commas,” and preferred to preface segments of dialogue with a dash. (The dash is often used this way in French.) The bible in its “Authorized Version” of 1611 has no quote marks, not as a reaction against them but because their use had not then been systematized. Like many aspects of our punctuation system, quotation marks were not in regular use until later C18. \n Occasional functions of quotation marks are to: \n ∗ enclose words used to translate others, e.g. Weltanschauung “world view” \n ∗ draw attention to words which are somehow out of the ordinary. They may be technical, or foreign, or nonce words. The quote marks would flank the word on its first appearance, but after that it appears without them. Some writers also use quotes as means of emphasis, for expressing irony, or commenting on a word that they feel is an imperfect choice. Quote marks used this way go by various ad hoc names such as “scare quotes,” “sneer quotes,” “shudder quotes” and “cute quotes.” Amid all those effects the quote marks do no more than indicate that the word is not one to take for granted. \n Using quote marks to highlight words for such a range of different purposes is not ideal. Alternative resources for technical and foreign terms are bold and italics, as well as small caps and underlining – depending on the text and type resources. Where quotes might be used for personal emphasis, the question to ask is whether they really serve any purpose. The Chicago Manual (1993) comments that “mature writers” do not rely on quote marks to express irony or other attitudes, but will convey the intended emphasis and meaning through the right choice of words, appropriately arranged. If something is still needed for emphasis, you could resort to bold or italic type. These various strategies help to take the load off quotation marks in running text. Most people find they look fussy when used around single words, and their exact significance becomes unclear (see below, end of section 2). Quote marks are best reserved purely for quoted material, and for translations or glosses of foreign words, as in many entries in this book. \n One other conventional use of quotation marks is to identify the titles of shorter compositions which form part of an anthology. So quote marks are used to embrace the names of lyric poems which are part of a published collection, and songs which make individual tracks on a record or CD. (On their use for journal articles, see titles section 3. On the use of quotation marks for the names of radio and TV programs, see italic(s) section 5.) \n 2 Double or single quotation marks. The English-speaking world is rather divided over this. Double quotes are the standard practice in the US, and for many Canadian presses and publishing houses. In the UK, double quotes are associated with newspapers and some publishers, while single quotes are recommended by Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press in their respective style guides. In Australia the pattern is similar: single quotes are recommended for government documents by the Style Manual (2002), while daily newspapers and many publishers use double quotes. \n The argument usually raised for single quotes is that they are more elegant than double quotes – though this suggests it’s a matter of taste. Arguments of space and efficiency are occasionally raised. But the amount of space saved by single quotes is negligible; and the fact that double quotes involve use of the shift key is of small consequence among all keystrokes used in typing a document. The chief argument in favor of double quotes is that they prevent confusion when the typewriter/printer reduces all aerial commas to a straight vertical or backward-leaning stroke. Compare: \n “It’s John’s.” with ‘It’s John’s.’ \n The use of double quotes ensures that the apostrophe and quote mark are visually distinct, however limited the type resources. \n Whether you choose double or single quotes as your normal practice, you will need the other when it comes to “quotes within quotes.” The alternatives are: \n The announcement was that “The council had decided to disallow the cutting of ‘significant trees,” even on private property.” \n  or \n The announcement was that ‘The council had decided to disallow the cutting of “significant trees,” even on private property.’ \n The choice of first level (double or single) entails the other for the second level. \n Beyond this is the question as to which level of quotation marks should be used to highlight other words and terms that crop up from time to time in the text. There is no “rule” (Butcher, 1992), and individuals and publishing houses set their own policies. Some use the first level of quote marks for words plucked out of an utterance, and the second level for marking terms – which doesn’t necessarily clarify things if the two levels are rarely seen together. Others use the first level of quotes for highlighting both – which leaves readers with the problem of knowing whether a single quoted word was spoken or is being highlighted for some other reason. Similar problems of interpretation arise for quotes within the titles of journal articles that are themselves set in quote marks (see titles section 3). These various dilemmas show that too much is being asked of quotation marks, and the need for alternative highlighting devices such as italics, bold or underlining for key terms. \n 3 Quotation marks with other punctuation. Which other punctuation marks to use with quote marks, and where to locate them, are vexed and variable issues. \n a) Before the quotation begins. According to older convention, a quotation is preceded by a comma: \n The old woman declared, “I’ll let you in on one condition.” \n This is still quite common practice in novels, though a simple space may serve the same purpose: \n The old woman declared “I’ll let you in on one condition.” \n In newspapers and magazines there’s a strong tendency to use a colon before quoted material: \n In his summing up, the judge noted: “This was a first offence.” \n Note that the quoted material always begins with a capital letter. \n b) Before presentational material. When a quotation is followed or interrupted by reference to the person who uttered it, any major punctuation mark (exclamation mark, question mark) and the comma which replaces a full stop goes inside the closing quote marks: \n “He’s coming up!” they exclaimed. \n “ Is he coming up?” they asked. \n “He’s coming,” they said. \n That principle is extended to all commas in American editing practice, even those which punctuate the carrier sentence rather than the quotation itself: \n “Your luggage,” they said, “is on the next plane.” \n Most Canadian editors do likewise, according to Editing Canadian English (2000), and it’s commonly implemented in British printing, according to Butcher (1992). The alternative British practice, shown in the Oxford Guide to Style (2002), is to place the comma “according to the sense,” which means leaving it outside the closing quote marks when it’s not integral to the quotation: \n “Your luggage”, they said, “is on the next plane.” \n The Australian government Style Manual also endorses this policy. But its implementation isn’t always as obvious as in that example, where grammar can be used to settle the matter. Speech is inherently variable, and the punctuation of scripted speech is always in the hands of the writer, who may well underpunctuate it (see punctuation section 3). So the simplicity of the American practice has much to recommend it. British and American editors agree that when a quotation is resumed after the presentational material, the first word is in lower case. \n c) At the end of the sentence. Where to put the final period / full stop is again a question on which editorial practices divide. In American style (Chicago Manual, 2003), it always goes inside the quotes, as also for most Canadian editors (Editing Canadian English). In British style the conventions are many and varied. According to Hart’s Rules (1983) the position of the full stop depends on whether what’s quoted is complete in itself, and completes the carrier sentence at the same time. If it fulfills those two conditions, the full stop goes inside; if the quotation is only part of a sentence, the full stop goes outside. Compare: \n The airline clerk said, “It’s on the next plane.” \n The airline clerk said it was “on the next plane.” \n The Oxford Guide to Style notes the further question as to whether the quotation was a finished sentence in the original (and therefore had its own full stop which would go inside the final quote marks). It concludes that what matters is the grammatical completeness of the quoted form, and placing the final full stop accordingly. A very different policy is indicated in British Standard 5261 (www.bsi.org.uk): that the full stop only goes inside if the quotation stands by itself as a full sentence. This would mean putting the full stop outside the closing quote marks in both the last two examples. The Australian government Style Manual endorses this latter practice, which has the advantage of making the rules for final punctuation with quote marks match up with those for parentheses (see brackets section 3). \n Whether the reader actually notices the position of the final period / full stop is rather dubious. Editors shed blood, sweat and tears over the issue, wrestling with anomalies not covered by the various rules; and the wastage of editorial time suggests there’s a lot to be said for a simple system. The North American practice (put it inside) is still the easiest to apply in texts with a lot of dialogue, because it can be applied to quotations of any length, whether in the middle or at the end of a sentence. But for nonfictional writing, the practice of treating final punctuation for quote marks the same way as for parentheses has much to recommend it. \n 4 Multiple final punctuation with quotation marks. Very occasionally a sentence with an embedded quotation seems to call for punctuation marks on either side of the final quote marks – combinations of question marks, exclamation points (exclamation marks) and periods / full stops. American and British style diverge on whether one or two stops are needed: see further under multiple punctuation."

		"title": "quotations",
		"explanation":"For nonfiction writers, quotations are essentially a way of bringing someone else’s words into your text. A quotation serves to invoke their authority in support of claims or arguments you’re making, or as a momentary evocation of their character and style Journalists and magazine reporters quite regularly resort to quoting statements made by public figures, in order to relieve the straight reportage and introduce a touch of drama. Yet when it happens in every news article, the switch from indirect narrative to directly quoted speech loses its effect, especially when the words quoted are remarkable for their clich´es and low level of significance. \n Educational and scholarly writers quote the words of other writers to lend weight to their ideas, while avoiding plagiarism. Inexperienced writers sometimes use quotations as a kind of academic showmanship (“Look how many authors I’ve read”), but it’s a mistake to quote too often on the same page. As in newspaper reporting, quotations seem less significant the more a writer resorts to them. Is the writer capable of expressing things independently, the reader begins to wonder. \n Introducing quotations. Quotations can only contribute effectively to your prose if they’re integrated smoothly into the surrounding text. A little editing may be needed to make them dovetail with the carrier sentence, and avoid a rough transition like the following: \n Joan Sutherland said that “I’m retiring from now on.” \n Either the carrier sentence, or the quotation itself needs a little adapting: \n Joan Sutherland said “I’m retiring from now on.” \n Joan Sutherland said that she would be “retiring from now on.” \n When the actual wording of the quotation is modified by the writer, the word(s) modified or introduced should be marked with square brackets: \n Joan Sutherland said that “[she would be] retiring from now on.” \n For more about the use of square brackets, see under brackets.

		"title": "rack or wrack",
		"explanation":"Several words coincide on these two spellings, and there’s no neat division of labor. Historically wrack is a variant of wreck, and so associated with shoreline debris, as in wrack brought in by the tide. The expression (w)rack and ruin preserves the original sense of destruction. (These days rack and ruin is the more common spelling in both British and American English, by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE.) Early uses of wrack survive also in expressions such as wrack of seaweed (cast up or growing on the shore), and the names of tidal plants such as bladderwrack. But the (w)rack of cloud (= “driven cloud”) which appears as rack in C14 English is more likely to go back to Old Scandinavian: the noun rek (“wreckage,” cognate with Old English wrack) and verb reka (“drive”). \n Totally independent from all these is rack (“framework”), originally Dutch and applied to wooden structures used in medieval crafts and trades, as well as the instrument of torture. These uses of the noun underlie the two major senses of the verb rack: \n * “store in a rack,” as in life rafts racked ready for the drop \n * “cause pain and/or severe distress”: the persistent cough that racked her \n The second sense, with its deconstructive overtones, is sometimes spelled wrack, and finds expression in many personal and political contexts. Nations are (w)racked by conflict, infighting, rebellion, war etc., and people with or by doubt, grief, guilt, longing, pressure etc. The same sense is expressed in (w)rack one’s brains, and in nerve-(w)racking (more often without the w than with it, though the ratio between the two is closer in corpus data from the UK than from the US). It spawns compound adjectives as in violence-wracked townships, the scandal-wracked bank, a recession-wracked economy – where the wr spelling seems to prevail along with the sense of destruction. \n Other verbal uses of rack resist the alternative spelling. The idiom rack up (“notch up”), used in sport and other competitive contexts, is always rack: \n Chiyo racked up a record 1045 wins. Angus has racked up a hit album. \n The dismissive rack off! (“go away”) used in Australia and New Zealand probably derives from rack meaning a horse’s gait (between a trot and a canter). \n In wine- and beer-making, rack is a technical term: the liquid is racked (i.e. drawn off the lees) into containers for secondary fermentation or storage. This verb seems to go back to Proven¸cal arracar (“separate from the dregs”). Still in the realms of gastronomy, the rack of lamb seems to go back to a dialectal word for the “forequarter,” i.e. neck and spine of a carcass, probably derived from Old English hracca, referring to the back of the skull. \n  As often, figurative uses of rack and wrack have enlarged their domains and made the spellings interchangeable wherever the sense of severe stress and destruction apply. Wrack seems to be gaining ground there, although still less common than rack in collocations such as nerve-racking and racking one’s brains. Rack is the regular spelling for the more physical and technical senses of the word, and in collocations such as rack up/off. \n ♦ For other words distinguished by wr/r spellings, see r or wr."

Racket is the original spelling, dating from C16 along with Henry VIII and royal tennis. The French-style spelling raquet was also used from C16 on as an alternative for the sporting weapon. Meanwhile racket has always been used to spell the informal word for “noise” as in making a racket, and “swindle,” as in running a racket. The spelling racquet was introduced in C19 when French permutations seem to have had special appeal (see frenchification); but it too shares the field with racket. In fact British writers represented in the BNC are about twice as likely to use racket as racquet for the sporting implement; and in American data from CCAE, racket prevails by about the same ratio in ordinary prose – although racquet is common in the names of private sports clubs, the generic “Health and Racquet Club.” The New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) put racket ahead of racquet as the headword, whereas the Australian Macquarie (1997) does the opposite.

In Britain, a raise still sounds American, according to Burchfield (1996), and it hardly appears in data from the BNC. Instead the noun rise is used for an increase in one’s salary – as for increases on any other more or less quantitative scale: temperature, profits, inflation or corruption. \n Curiously, regional usage of raise/rise with flour works differently.

		"title": "rap up or wrap up",
		"explanation":"The word rap (“knock”) slips easily into colloquial idiom, taking on new expressive meanings as it goes. In C19 British slang and dialect, it could mean “talk” as well as “boast,” and these uses have taken off in C20 in different parts of the world. In American English, the first sense has become “talk discursively” (as verb) or have a rap / rap session (as noun/atttributive). Rap music has no doubt helped to popularize this sense. The second, in Australian and New Zealand idiom, is commuted into meaning “commend”/“commendation”: couldn’t rap him up enough, give him a rap (up). At this point rap up collides with the idiom wrap up, used throughout the English-speaking world to mean “bring to a close,” whenever the commendation is or could be the peroration. The Australian National Dictionary (1988) shows that the spelling with wr is common for rap up (“commend”), though it may lose the intended sense. \n Meanwhile there’s some evidence in American English of wrap up (when it means “bring to a close”) being misspelled rap up. The spelling is less crucial for meaning with the curt British idiom wrap up = “shut up,” because it’s normally an imperative (or phrased as wrap it up!). Elsewhere, the presence or absence of the w may be the defining moment for the reader."

The last example shows how rapt in converges with informal use of the Anglo-Saxon verb wrap in the idiom wrapped up in (“be engrossed with”), as in completely wrapped up in the children. It amounts to much the same as rapt in the children, except that wrapped up in seems more colloquial and down-to-earth in style.

		"title": "rather and rather than",
		"explanation":"The word rather has three roles, as: \n 1 hedge word: He plays rather well. \n 2 comparative adverb: \n a) The family would rather that she played the flute. \n b) I get the news from radio rather than television. \n c) He asked for any posting rather than Brazil. \n 3 conjunct: The committee is not against strong views. \n Rather it’s a matter of how they’re expressed. \n In its role of comparative adverb, rather covers a range of meanings, shown in sentences (a) to (c) above. It may suggest a preference, as in (a); or a very strong determination which allows no alternatives, as in (c). Sentence (b) is somewhere in between and in fact rather ambiguous. Does it express a preference, or a commitment? If the difference is crucial, rather needs to be replaced by “in preference to” for the first meaning, and “instead of ” for the second. \n Ambiguity can also arise between conjunctive use of rather and its use as a hedge word. See for example: \n He rather thought that she should pay her own way. \n Without more context we cannot tell whether rather is there to gently modify the verb, or to make a strong contrast equivalent to “instead.” \n Grammatical options with rather than. What form of word to use after rather than is sometimes an issue with pronouns and with verbs. \n When two pronouns are being compared with rather than, standard practice is to give the case of the first one to the second: \n They’re coming to talk to him. Rather him than me. \n We rather than they should be doing the course. \n However in informal and impromptu speech there’s a tendency to use the objective case every time after than: \n We rather than them should be doing the course. \n Neither version sounds ideal, and a better result altogether comes with rephrasing the sentence: \n We not they should be doing the course. \n It’s us not them who should be doing the course. \n The first version is more formal in style, the second more conversational. \n When two verbs are being compared with rather than, there are two possible constructions which are stylistically equal but grammatically different: either coordinate the two verbs, or subordinate one to the other. Writers may choose to: \n i) repeat the first form of the verb after rather than (matching its tense and number): \n With pulse racing, she trotted rather than walked to the stairs. \n It supplements rather than replaces publications of the past. \n In these examples, rather than coordinates the two verbs. Note however that if the segment with rather than comes first, it effectively subordinates it: \n Rather than address the problem, politicians look for the quick “fix.” \n ii) use the -ing form for the second option: \n Politicians look for the quick “fix” rather than addressing the problem. \n With -ing, the rather than construction is always subordinate, whether it is effectively a nonfinite clause (with the participle) or a noun phrase (with gerund). It often highlights a preference, as noted in the Longman Grammar (1999). In data from the BNC and CCAE, the coordinate construction (i.e. repeating the form of the first verb) is the commoner of the two. The likelihood of the second increases with the distance between the two verbs."

		"title": "ravage or ravish",
		"explanation":"Both words refer to powerful and usually destructive forces. Ravage is used when destruction is spread over a wide area by war or other overwhelming forces: ravaged by inflation / tribal warfare / acid rain. Ravish typically has a human subject and object, and means “seize, rape” or somewhat paradoxically “transport with delight.” The two kinds of meaning have their respective clichés in ravished virgins and ravished audiences, which are symptomatic of the fact that the word is usually either euphemistic or hyperbolic. The word screens the deed when a man finds his teenage daughter being ravished by a young police officer. And when a skilled TV interviewer is said to have ravished the public, its praise is somehow laced with irony. The dark forces underlying ravish come to the surface in BNC examples such as the social fabric has been profoundly ravished; and contamination with ravage shows in Large parts of Africa were ravished by drought. Compare: \n Fires have ravaged parts of eastern Australia in recent weeks. \n The rather amorphous and emotive frontiers of ravish may well leave readers wondering what is actually meant. It lends itself to parody, as in I ravished the refrigerator. Quasi-literary uses of ravish in fact seem to dominate the evidence from the BNC, suggesting that the word is on the brink of self-destruction."

		"title": "ravel or unravel",
		"explanation":"These words present a tangle of meanings from their first appearances in late C16 English. Borrowed from Dutch, ravel meant “fray out,” the way threads or stitches come undone at the edge of a fabric. This image underlies the need [for sleep] to “knit up the raveled sleeve of care,” as Lady Macbeth put it. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) records other Shakespearean examples in which ravel meant “entangle” – as happens with frayed threads. The two senses imply different kinds of negative: disintegration with the first sense, and enmeshed disorder with the second. Add to this the fact that both senses could be transitive or intransitive, and you have ambiguities that would explain the rapid appearance of unravel (“disentangle,” with positive implications), early in C17. Yet while it was/is an antonym for the second sense of ravel, it also serves as a synonym for the first sense. Compare the physical and figurative senses in the following: \n * “disentangle” \n He patiently unravelled the bootlaces \n Detectives are trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the death \n * “come apart” \n Her torn canvas top unravelled in the wind \n Then she was stricken with multiple sclerosis and the fairy tale quickly unravelled \n In data from the BNC, figurative use of unravel meaning “disentangle” is the most popular of the four just illustrated, and the uses of “come apart” (or “unwind,” as in let the [fishing] line unravel) are usually physical. Meanwhile ravel is rare in both British and American English, with few examples of any of its uses in either BNC or CCAE. Unravel has gone some way towards resolving four centuries of ambiguity. \n ♦ For the choice between raveled and ravelled, unraveled and unravelled etc., see -l-/-ll-."

		"title": "re",
		"explanation":"This Latin tag is used in official letter writing to identify the subject under discussion. It abbreviates the Latin phrase in re (“in the matter of ”), and is not therefore a clipped form of “regarding,” as is sometimes thought. It prefaces the subject line in a business letter, typically following the salutation, as in: \n Dear Editor \n re: Schedule for production of annual report \n Copy for the company’s Annual Report will be sent to you . . . \n In that position it’s often set in lower case, and followed by a colon. However re can also appear in upper case and without a colon. This is naturally the case when it occurs ahead of the salutation line as in: \n In that position it’s often set in lower case, and followed by a colon.

This is naturally the case when it occurs ahead of the salutation line as in: \n Re schedule for production of annual report \n  Dear Editor \n Copy for the company’s Annual Report will be sent to you . . . \n This relatively new position for the re line makes it more visible, and matches the way in which headers are used to identify the subject of correspondence in both memos and e-mail. \n Re is too well established to need italics, and can even be used informally to replace concerning or regarding, as in yesterday’s discussion re the parents’ evening.

Yet in many of the French loanwords in which it occurs, re- is inseparably bound into the word itself, witness: \n receive refuse remember repeat resign reveal \n In modern English words formed with re-, the meaning is always “again,” a point which is shown up when we compare the new or ad hoc formations with older ones, for example re-create/recreate, re-mark/remark, re-serve/reserve. The hyphen is vital to identify the meanings of the new words and distinguish them from the old. Further examples are: \n re-act re-claim re-collect re-count re-cover \n re-form re-fund re-lay re-lease re-petition \n re-place re-present re-sent re-sort \n In British, Canadian and Australian English, a hyphen is normally used when re- comes up against e in forming a new word – whether or not the letters match an old word.

		"title": "-re/-er",
		"explanation":"The choice between centre/center, fibre/fiber etc. is a matter on which American English and others divide. In the US, spellings with -er are standard, whereas in the UK -re spellings are strongly preferred. Australians ally themselves with the British on this, as do most Canadians, according to Canadian English Usage (1997), though the -er alternatives are recognized in the Canadian Oxford (1998). The -re spellings match the French form of the word, adding to their value in Canada and Britain (see frenchification). \n The latinate spellings with -er were commonly used from C16 to early C18, and appear in editions of Shakespeare and the earliest dictionaries. But centre was the headword in Johnson’s dictionary (1755), and -re spellings became standard in Britain in the decades that followed. Webster however endorsed center etc. in his radical dictionary of 1806, and maintained the older spellings in the US. \n The words affected by this spelling practice are (in their non-American form): \n calibre centre fibre goitre \n litre louvre lustre manouevre \n meagre mitre ochre philtre \n reconnoitre sabre sceptre sepulchre \n sombre spectre theatre titre \n Some -re words nevertheless keep that spelling even in American English, including: \n acre cadre lucre macabre \n mediocre ogre timbre \n These words resist -er either because it would seem to “soften” the c or g of the stem (see -ce/-ge), or because of other aspects of the word’s meaning and identity. (Timbre would be otherwise be identical with timber.) \n Those who use -re spellings have the advantage when it comes to forming the derivatives of all those words. The stem of the word remains the same in centre/central or fibre/fibrous, with just the regular dropping of the final e before a suffix beginning with a vowel (see -e section 1). Those who use -er spellings have to put the stem though a conversion rule before adding suffixes (see -er>-r-). The fact that some of the words above are only spelled -re makes it the better choice overall. \n ♦ For the choice of metre or meter, see under that heading. \n International English selection: The choice of -re allows a consistent pattern for all English words of this type, including those which have to be excepted where -er is otherwise the norm. The ease of forming derivatives is a further linguistic argument for it. Extensive use of -re in Canada adds to its distributional strength, apart from its use in Britain and other Commonwealth countries."

Afforestation is the oldest by far, originating during C15 as the notorious policy of increasing the size of forests to provide hunting grounds for the rich. The pleonastic reafforestation was used in the same way in C17. But in the 1880s both reafforestation and reforestation are recorded as expressing environmental concerns about the loss of the world’s natural forests. In current British English afforestation, reforestation and reafforestation are all used for this, but they stand in the ratio of about 4:2:1 in terms of their popularity with BNC writers. In American English reforestation dominates, with scant evidence of either of the others in data from CCAE. \n The International Forestry Association in 1971 endorsed both afforestation and reforestation, using them to distinguish between two kinds of replanting. Thus: \n * afforestation = planting a species of timber which does not naturally occur in the region, e.g. planting softwood pine trees in Australia \n * reforestation = reestablishing native trees in areas from which they have been cleared \n Outside the circles of silviculturists, this distinction is not regularly observed."

		"title": "real or really",
		"explanation":"These words can get overused in impromptu conversation, but both have legitimate roles. Really is an adverb with dual functions. It can mean “truly, actually,” as in They were really there. In addition it’s often used as a kind of intensifier, as in They were really great (see further under intensifiers). The two meanings are not always easy to separate. Both are latent in the second example, and in the ones below where really modifies verbs: \n They really wanted to talk. \n What really worries me is their disinclination to act. \n Real has a regular role as an adjective meaning “true, genuine, actual,” as in real friend, real pearls, real life. Real estate and real property means assets in the form of land and the buildings on it, i.e. tangible rather than paper assets. From meanings like those, real comes to be used in phrases like real facts and a real problem, in which its role is more the intensifier. Some would object to this as a misuse of real, though it has already happened with really. The problem with such phrases might rather be that they are clichéd. \n The use of real most subject to query is its colloquial role as an adverb (once again an intensifier): That’s real bad news. Collocations such as real good, real quick are common conversational idioms in North America, and so real is much more often an adverb in American conversation than in British. The ratio is about 14:1, according to data examined for the Longman Grammar (1999). Americans also make extensive use of really in adding emphasis to what’s said, using it almost twice as often as the British, according to the Grammar. Thus real and really coexist as adverbs in American speech, sometimes as alternates in the same utterance. This coexistence probably serves as a reminder that real is not the fully fledged adverb and therefore nonstandard, like many of the zero adverbs (see further under that heading). So despite its relative frequency, American commentators are disinclined to accept real in writing, or at least formal writing. Webster’s English Usage (1989) and Canadian English Usage (1997) show that real certainly appears in journalistic prose and in fiction, wherever authentic idiom is harnessed for emphasis. But in writing, the adverb real quickly becomes conspicuous, and needs to be paraphrased by some other intensifier – that is, if it is needed at all."

In the second case, it begins to overlap with resound (“echo”), though the imagery is a little different. A noise which rebounds seems to set up discrete sound waves, whereas one which resounds creates an environment of sound. Another extension of rebound is to refer to an effect resulting from another kind of action, as in: \n The reduced flow of fresh water will rebound on fisheries. \n This usage has something in common with that of the now quite rare verb redound (“have an effect, contribute to”), as in: \n The research will redound to the anthropologist’s credit. \n As in that example, redound now mostly associates with positive entities like credit, honor, profit, where rebound often entails a negative for those affected. Earlier negative uses of redound, as in May his sin redound on his head, are now more likely to become rebound on his head. Even redounded to their credit may these days be paraphrased as resounded to their credit. Redound has clearly lost out to rebound and resound."

Compare: \n . . . minimize the later recurrence of stress and anxiety \n The next step is to prevent a recurrence. Reoccur and reoccurrence focus on the individual episode, as in: \n Former tennis champion Pat Cash suffered a reoccurrence of a knee injury. \n With reoccurrence, the event has happened again but without necessarily being part of a pattern. Its record begins in early C19, according to the Oxford Dictionary, but it has little patronage in current British or American English, by the mere handful of examples in BNC and CCAE.

		"title": "reduced forms",
		"explanation":"In the flow of conversation we commonly reduce the sounds and syllables of words, to ease the process of uttering them, and the amount of decoding for the listener. This results in contractions such as can’t and would’ve, which embody “weak forms” of not and have respectively. The weak form of have is so common that it’s sometimes mistakenly spelled “of,” in “could of,” “should of,” even by adult writers. \n Reduced forms of syntax are a common feature of conversation, when we use phrases rather than complete clauses while exchanging ideas: \n [Have you] Ever tried parachuting? \n [I wouldn’t try it] Not if you paid me. \n The brackets show roughly what’s been left out of the utterance, words which would help to make full sentences but contain repetitive material. The exchange is brisker without them. \n Reduced forms of words and contractions are unsuitable for formal writing, where they need to be replaced by the fully fledged form. They suggest the informality and the give-and-take of conversation, and may seem to distract from the dignity and authority of the writer’s voice. Yet they do reduce the bulk of routine function words and can help to move the underlying rhythm of the prose – which makes them a useful part of any writer’s repertoire. They are increasingly seen in expository writing: see contractions section 2."

		"title": "reductio ad absurdum",
		"explanation":"In Latin this means “reducing [it] to the absurd.” It describes an argumentative tactic which makes an extreme deduction from a proposition – one which is obviously contrary to common sense and accepted truth. The technique is used in formal logic to show the falseness of a proposition, but it’s also used more informally to discredit someone else’s position. For example, those who argue against offering asylum to refugees sometimes suggest that accepting them means the end of the visa system as we know it. The argument thus stretches a proposition (allow in some displaced persons without visas) to an extreme (anyone can enter). It reduces the social and moral questions embedded in the proposition to bureaucratic procedures."

		"title": "redundancy",
		"explanation":"Redundancy is a matter of using more words than are needed to express a point. Sometimes it’s matter of sheer repetition as in: \n They waved a greeting and they went on. \n The second “they” seems redundant and clumsy, because English grammar allows us to read the subject of the second clause from the first in a coordinated sentence where the two subjects are the same. (See ellipsis section 1.) Very occasionally a writer may wish to repeat something which is normally ellipted for the sake of emphasis, but usually it makes for redundancy. \n Redundancy often arises through the overlap of meaning between different words which are combined in the same phrase or sentence. Compare “the four members of the quartet” with all members of the quartet, where the second version avoids double reference to the actual size of the group. (See further under pleonasm and tautology.) \n Redundant information and strategic repetition. Other kinds of redundancy can occur in communicating information, when a detail is reported twice over in a brief stretch of writing, or irrelevant details are included. The document’s purpose and its expected readers should settle what needs to be said and what may be beside the point. Avoiding unnecessary repetition is a matter of careful organization, structuring content so that information is presented at the crucial and most productive moment – not too early, so that it has to be repeated. You may nevertheless wish to foreshadow issues in general terms at the start of a longer document, and summarize them at the end. Strategic repetition of that kind helps to underscore document structure; and the more general terms of discussion used in the introduction/conclusion, and the more specific treatment of the issues in the main body of the document, will set them apart and prevent any sense of redundancy.

Reduplicatives often have an informal feel to them, and their use can be off-handed or derogatory. \n In a small number of cases, English reduplicatives involve identical words, as in: \n fifty-fifty goody-goody hush-hush \n never-never pooh-pooh pretty-pretty \n tut-tut \n As the examples show, they are always the informal word for the concept they refer to."

In reference to is the older of the two, dating from late C16, while with reference to (from early C18) varies with it, especially in business letters, where it benchmarks the state of correspondence, as in: \n With reference to your letter of 26 April, I am pleased to report that . . . \n While in reference to is fully grammaticalized and fixed in its form, with reference to can be varied a little, as in with frequent/passing/occasional reference to. Databases show that in reference to is much more common than with reference to, at least in the UK. The ratio between them is more than 20:1 in BNC data, but about 5:1 in data from CCAE. \n In American English with reference to also serves as a variant of by reference to. Compare: \n The group justifies the call with reference to the Geneva Convention. \n . . . justified by reference to UN resolutions that affirm the right to . . . \n In these cases, the phrase introduced by with/by reference to is closely tied to the verb, rather than a detachable adverbial (see predicate final note).

	{
		"title": "referencing",
		"explanation":"Writers of reports and scholarly papers often have to refer to other publications to support their own statements and conclusions. There are conventional ways of doing this, so as to provide necessary information for the reader while minimizing the interruption. The five main systems are: \n * short title \n * footnotes or endnotes \n * author–date references, also known as running references or (outside North America) as the Harvard system \n * author–number system \n * number system (Vancouver style) \n The short title system is used in general books, while the others are associated with academic publications. The footnote/endnote system is mostly used in the humanities, including history and law. Author–date references are used in the sciences and social sciences, and the number system in biomedical writing. Some publications use a combination of systems, with author–date references for citing other publications, and occasional footnotes for a more substantial comment by the writer or editor. Footnotes were rather difficult to set or adjust on the earliest wordprocessors, and this probably encouraged wider use of author–date references. Other things being equal, author–date references are preferable to a number system, because they give some immediate information to the reader. \n 1 Short title references are cut-down variants of full references, with enough distinctive information to remind readers of the identity of the work being invoked (see short titles). They have long been used in footnotes (see below, section 2), but now increasingly within the text itself. With the abbreviated title and (optionally) its date, they provide more immediate information than either author-date references or numbers which take readers away to footnotes or the bibliography. They still depend on full references being given in an accumulated reference list. \n 2 Footnotes and endnotes keep reference material out of the ongoing discussion. Only a superscript number intervenes to guide the eye to the bottom of the page, or to the end of the chapter/book when you’re ready. The numerals for footnotes can recommence with every page, or run through a whole chapter as is usual for endnotes. Occasionally the enumeration runs through the whole book, which makes for increasingly large superscript numbers (often three digits). But their uniqueness is a help to readers searching among accumulated notes at the back of the book. \n Some writers use footnotes/endnotes to discuss a particular point which might seem to digress from the main argument. These are substantive footnotes. But mostly footnotes/endnotes serve to identify source publications, and so must include whatever the reader needs to track them down. In the first reference to any source, it’s important to name the author, title, date of publication and the relevant page numbers. Unless there are full details in the bibliography, the footnotes should include the place of publication and also the name of the publisher: \n G. Blainey Tyranny of Distance (Melbourne: Sun Books, 1966) pp. 23–31 \n Note that the author’s name or initials come in front of the surname (not inverted as in a bibliography). Questions of punctuating the titles and the order of items are discussed under bibliography: see final section on “Points to note.” \n Second and later references to the same work can be cut back, as can endnotes grouped together for the same chapter. The author’s name may be sufficient: \n Blainey, pp. 95–6 \n However if another work by the same author is cited in the same group of footnotes/endnotes, short titles will be needed for both: \n Blainey, Spinnifex, p. 66 \n Blainey, Tyranny, pp. 95–6 \n Latin abbreviations used in referencing (ibid., loc.cit., op.cit.) are discussed at their individual entries. \n 3 Author–date references explain in passing what source publication is being alluded to, but the reference is kept to the bare essentials: just the author’s surname, the date of the publication, and the relevant pages indicated by numbers only, with no pp. The information is enclosed in brackets, and followed by a comma, full stop etc. as the sentence requires: \n Regional usages often stop at state borders in Australia, as did the earliest railway developments (Blainey, 1966:95–6). \n The final punctuation is never included inside the final bracket of a running reference, even though it may be with other kinds of parentheses (see brackets section 2). \n If reference is made to two or more authors with the same surname in the course of an article or book, a distinguishing initial must be added into the basic reference. And when referring to more than one publication by the same author in the same year, the two need to be distinguished, as 1966a and 1966b, in the running references as well as the bibliography. The second and subsequent references are identical to the first, except in the case of publications with joint authors. The first reference normally gives the surnames of all authors, unless there are four or more of them, in which case only the first author is named, followed by et al. This is the regular practice for second and later references. The author–date system relies very heavily on a full list of references to supply details of the author(s), titles, and the publishing information. \n 4 The author–number system works by enumerating the works of each author referred to as a set, instead of using dates of publication. So if four publications by Blainey are referred to in a particular article, they will be Blainey (1), Blainey (2) etc. within the text, and listed together with those numbers in their alphabetical place in the bibliography. \n 5 The number system uses a sequence of superscripts, or bracketed numbers on the line of text, to refer the reader to publication details in the reference list. The use of superscripts is more distinct, but more difficult to place in relation to other punctuation when the numbers become large: neither McBride,148 nor McBride148, seems ideal. In the Vancouver version of this system, more than one number may be used at the same point, as in: . . . the evidence discussed by McBride [148, 149]. Parentheses may be used instead of square brackets, though they may then be mistaken for other kinds of parenthetical material. Some writers, according to Webster’s Style Manual (1985), use the brackets to contain both a reference number and a page number, the two being separated by a comma, with the first in italics and the second in roman, e.g. (4, 216). The parenthetical reference is placed after any punctuation (comma, period / full stop etc.), which detaches it somewhat from the point it’s intended to detail. Whatever notation is used, the numbers fix the order of titles in the reference list, so they are not arranged alphabetically as in other referencing systems. A further disadvantage is that the numbering has to be adjusted throughout whenever a reference is added or taken out. The Vancouver bibliography style works with minimal punctuation of authors’ names, and abbreviated styles for titles of journals and publishers’ names. See bibliographies section C, and notes following."

		"title": "reflexive pronouns",
		"explanation":"The pronouns ending in -self or -selves are reflexive, and typically refer back to the subject of the sentence. They include: \n myself yourself him/her/itself oneself \n ourselves yourselves themselves (themself) \n This standard English set of reflexives is a mix of words formed with the possessive pronoun (my, your, our) and the object pronoun (him, her, it, them). For theirselves, see under themself. \n Reflexive pronouns are selected to correspond in person and number (and for the third person singular, in gender) with the subject: \n I must see for myself. \n He shot himself in the foot. \n They came by themselves. \n In cases like these, the reflexive pronoun serves as the object of a verb or preposition, and its position in the sentence is fixed. \n Reflexive pronouns can also be used to emphasize any other noun or name in the sentence, standing immediately after it: \n They talked to the president himself. \n You yourselves might go that way. \n In shorter sentences where the reflexive underscores the subject, it can also appear at the other end of the sentence: \n You might go that way yourselves. \n Recurrent choices among the reflexive pronouns have been found to reflect the genre of writing (Longman Grammar, 1999). Fiction writers make most use of the singular personal reflexives (myself, himself, herself), whereas the impersonal itself and themselves are most common in nonfiction. \n The reflexive pronouns are sometimes used without an explicit antecedent, as a bulky substitute for the regular pronoun, as in: \n With yourself as project leader, the team is complete. \n The idea is for Jan and myself to visit him. \n (For the sometimes self-conscious effects of this use of myself, see me.) In comparative expressions, the reflexive pronoun also appears without antecedent, although it may be expressed in the surrounding text. \n No-one knew better than ourselves what was meant. \n Other comparative prepositions, including as, but for, except, like can likewise take reflexive pronouns on their own."

		"title": "reflexive verbs",

The same is true of German and Italian. One example is the verb remember which is reflexive in all three languages (se rappeler / sich erinnern / ricordarsi), but never in English."

But a decade later the New Oxford (1998) comments that the disputed use of refute is “now widely accepted in standard English.” This is in line with ample evidence of its use in British English, in a variety of texts included in the BNC. Merriam-Webster (2000) presents the second definition (“deny the truth of ”) alongside the first (“prove wrong”) without comment. The Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) still carry warning labels about using refute to mean “deny,” though it seems unlikely that the objections can be sustained much longer in the face of usage.

It can be applied to the dress of a particular period, e.g. 1950s regalia, nineteenth century feminist regalia – and even late C20 skiers in day-glo regalia, among the examples from CCAE and the BNC. The phrase royal regalia is not felt to be a tautology. With this semantic change, regalia has acquired a collective sense that goes with a singular verb, as in: \n take great pains to ensure their regalia is authentic. \n It entails a singular pronoun: \n . . . her official regalia in all its purple magnificence \n Singular agreement occurs more often than plural in BNC data, and New Oxford (1998) notes that either may be used.

They are wordy conveniences, the stuff of bureaucratic writing and commercialese (see under that heading), now used elsewhere in reporting and strategic planning. \n The established written forms in regard to and with regard to are in the singular, though the plural forms in/with regards to are also well documented in American and British English. They have probably been affected by yet other idioms: the complex preposition as regards, and perhaps the phrase give my regards to, popularized in the musical/movie titles Give my regards to Broadway (1948) and Give my regards to Broad Street (1984). In data from the BNC, the plural forms tend to occur in more interactive discourse (written and spoken), and Webster’s English Usage (1989) also notes that in regards to seems to be in oral rather than written use. This would explain the negative comment which it seems to have attracted, especially from American commentators. But CCAE provides more than occasional examples of in/with regards to from newspaper sources, alongside in/with regard to, in the ratio of about 1:9. BNC data shows the opposite trend: instances of in/with regards to outnumber those of in/with regard to by about 4:1. The plural form is thus unremarkable in the UK, but a distraction from the singular form in the US. In both British and American usage, with regard(s) to is more popular than in regard(s) to, though the difference is much greater in British (by a factor of 5:1 rather than 5:4). The American preference for the singular form (regard to) may be aligned with their use of the s-less forms of certain adverbs. See -ward or -wards."

		"explanation":"Doctors prescribing a course of therapy (diet, exercise etc.) may call it a regimen, where the nontechnical term is regime. It amounts to the same thing, whether it’s a regimen involving no alcoholic beverages or a regime of no booze. The doctor’s avoidance of regime probably reflects the fact that it has nonmedical meanings as well, and, like scientists generally, they prefer their words to be unequivocal. The added issue is that when (as often) regime refers to a particular system of government, administration or social system, e.g. a Fascist regime, its overtones are usually negative. All this is unhelpful for the doctor seeking a patient’s compliance with therapy, and so the neutral regimen recommends itself. The only snag is its relative unfamiliarity: regime outnumbers regimen by more than 12:1 in CCAE, and almost 30:1 in the BNC. \n Regime does not need an acute accent these days, despite its French background.

Regrettably is one of a set of attitudinal adverbs which can be deployed for interpersonal contact in writing.

		"explanation":"The choice between these becomes an issue when you want to refer to an abstract connection, because there is some stylistic difference.

Relationship is also used in a wide variety of references to personal, social and political connections e.g. married relationship, loving relationship, where relation could not appear.

		"title": "relations or relatives",
		"explanation":"Both can refer to “your sisters and your cousins and your aunts.” But in current American and British English, relatives is by far the more popular of the two, in data from CCAE and the BNC. Relative(s) needs no explanation, whereas relations (in the sense of “family”) is usually contextualized so as to clarify its use, as in friends and relations / relations and friends. Otherwise, relations is typically used in more abstract ways, in collocations such as human/ industrial/public/race relations or bad/frosty/ good/improved relations. The use of relatives for “family” prevents any temporary ambiguity over whether your “political relations” are your cousins in parliament or contacts with people in power."

		"title": "relative clauses",
		"explanation":"Sometimes known as adjectival clauses, these serve either to define, or to describe and evaluate the noun to which they’re attached. They stand right next to it, even if this delays the predicate of the main clause (see clauses sections 3 and 4). For example: \n The radio that we bought at the market has never given any trouble. \n But there are grammatical issues in the connection and relationship between the relative clause and the main clause, notably \n * the choice of pronoun (and when it can be omitted) \n * the status of the relative clause in relation to the rest (as a “sentence relative,” or as a restrictive or nonrestrictive clause) \n 1 Relative clauses and relative pronouns. Relative clauses are often introduced by one of the relative pronouns such as that, which, who etc. (the wh-pronouns). The choice is a matter of grammar and style (see below, section 4, and next entry: relative pronouns). In certain stylistic and grammatical circumstances there may be no pronoun at all, the so-called “zero relative.” Except in the most formal style, the pronoun can be omitted from relative clauses of which it’s the object. \n The radio we bought at the market has never given any trouble. \n But when the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it’s almost always expressed, whatever the style: \n The radio that came from the market has never given any trouble. \n Delete “that” from the sentence and it’s very likely to be misread, with nothing to signal the fact that “came” belongs to a subordinate clause. In speech it can be signaled through intonation, as in Irish English; but readers need the relative pronoun to express the subject of the relative clause. \n 2 Relative clauses and relative adverbs. Some relative clauses are linked to the main clause by adverbs such as when, where, why: \n I remember the time when we made marshmallow kebabs. \n You remember the place where we met. \n They remember the reason why we looked so strange. \n The wh-adverbs act as relators of the second clause to a noun of time, place or reason in the main clause. (“Time” could be expressed by more particular words such as year, day, night; “place” by house, hotel etc.) In less formal styles, the relative adverbs can be replaced by that, as in \n I remember the time that we made marshmallow kebabs. \n And even omitted altogether: \n I remember the time we made marshmallow kebabs. \n The Longman Grammar (1999) confirms the use of the same alternatives (using that or zero relative) for where and why, with examples from fiction writing as well as conversation. But the omission of when is acceptable further up the stylistic ladder. The Longman research shows the use of zero relative for when across all writing styles from fiction to news reporting and academic prose. \n 3 Sentence relatives. These are relative clauses which relate to the whole preceding clause, not to any one noun in it: \n They wanted to go home by ferry, which I thought was a good idea. \n Sentence relatives are always prefaced by which. Some style guides warn against them, and occasionally it’s unclear whether the relative relates to the whole sentence or the last noun in it. Unless this creates ambiguity, sentence relatives are no problem, and they serve to add the writer’s comment on the main statement or proposition of a sentence. \n 4 Restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses. Relative clauses which serve to define or identify something in the main clause are often called “restrictive” – and so others that describe or evaluate or add writers’ comments are “nonrestrictive.” (Alternative names are defining and nondefining relative clauses.) Compare the following: \n People who sign such agreements are crazy. (restrictive) \n I met his brothers, who signed the agreement. (nonrestrictive) \n As in these examples, the restrictive relative clause helps defines the previous noun, whereas the second simply adds information. Research reported in the Longman Grammar (1999) shows that restrictive relative clauses are far more common in all kinds of writing. Yet the distinction between restrictive and nonrestrictive is not always clear cut, especially after indefinite antecedents: \n In the files I found an agreement which was signed under pressure. \n In cases like this, there is no difference in meaning one way or the other. In others it makes a considerable difference, as in: \n The department shredded all the files from the inquiry which contained embarrassing material. \n Did the department destroy every file (nonrestrictive interpretation), or only those with embarrassing contents (restrictive)? In practice the issue would probably resolve itself in the context of discourse. \n Usage commentators have traditionally urged the use of a comma with unrestrictive relative clauses, so as to separate them from the antecedent and prevent ambiguity. The principle of a separating comma is widely observed – in 90% of all cases in Meyer’s (1987) research – despite the general trend toward lighter punctuation. The complementary prescription is to use that rather than wh- pronouns with restrictive clauses, but that is far from universally practised (see next entry)."

		"title": "relative pronouns",
		"explanation":"Words such as who, which, whom, whose, that, are the relative pronouns that typically introduce relative clauses: \n The doctor who/that came from Sri Lanka spoke well. \n The letter which/that I sent you should arrive tomorrow. \n The lion which/that escaped from the circus has been found. \n A woman whom/that I’d never seen before appeared. \n The nurse whose face would cure a thousand ills was frowning. \n As the examples show, that can be used for human referents as well as nonhuman and inanimate ones. It serves as an alternative to any of the wh-pronouns except whose (see further under who and whose). The total omission of the relative pronoun (= zero relative) is discussed under relative clauses sections 1 and 2. \n The distribution of that and the wh- alternatives has been a topic of stylistic discussion since C18. That is sometimes thought of as informal, and this correlates with it being the most frequent relative pronoun in both conversation and fiction, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. By contrast which predominates in nonfiction generally, along with who in news reporting. \n The choice between that and a wh- pronoun is to some extent affected by whether it prefaces a restrictive or nonrestrictive relative clause (see relative clauses section 4). The notion that that goes with restrictive and which etc. with the nonrestrictive is put as an ideal by Fowler (1926), though even he admitted: “It would be idle to pretend it was the practice either of most or of the best writers.” Later style commentators note that while wh- relative pronouns are indeed preferred for nonrestrictive relative clauses, both that and which/who are used with the restrictive type: \n People who sign such agreements are ill-advised. \n People that sign such agreements are ill-advised. \n The Longman Grammar shows that which (and who) are actually used more for restrictive than nonrestrictive clauses in all kinds of writing, from a corpus of British and American English. However the Chicago Manual (2003) endorses the Fowlerian ideal as good practice, and American editors and writers more often seem to be exponents of it than their counterparts elsewhere. \n In some restrictive contexts, the use of that is nevertheless normal worldwide. For example: \n * after superlatives: the best wine that’s made in New Zealand ... \n * after ordinal numbers: the first hotel that has a vacancy ... \n * after indefinites (some, any, every, much, little, all): I’ll take back any that are unused . . . \n * in a cleft sentence: It’s the label that has a bird on it.  \n * when the antecedents are both human and nonhuman: \n Neither horse nor rider that fail the water jump find it easy to recover. \n Grammar apart, the choice of relative pronouns may be a matter of style and convenience. That saves us some decisions about who versus which (e.g. with babies) – not to mention who versus whom. With its various restrictive uses, that isn’t necessarily informal; and it is available as an alternative when which with its greater bulk would claim undue attention. That makes the linkage with the main clause less conspicuous, and helps the merger in a densely worded sentence. By the same token, which is a useful variant for that when it is already bespoken in some other role: \n That is the phrase which appeals most to me. Compare the chiming effect of: \n  That is the phrase that appeals most to me. \n Whatever else they do, the relative pronouns are a resource for optimizing one’s style. \n ♦ See entry on that for its multiple grammatical functions."

In the phrase beyond their remit, the word is used to limit the scope and power of others. This use of remit is at home in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, but not in North America. Canadian Oxford (1998) notes it as “chiefly Brit.,” and Merriam-Webster (2000) makes no mention of it.

Renascence is slightly more evident in American English, with a dozen examples in CCAE, compared with over 2000 of renaissance. The one solitary example in BNC data (Third World renascence) seems to mark its exit from British English. Writers everywhere are more likely to use renaissance, when referring to any kind of rebirth or revival, as in the artistic renaissance of Birmingham. \n With a capital letter, Renaissance is the standard term for referring to the flowering of European culture that began in Italy in C14 and reached Britain in C16. It marked the end of medieval culture with its emphasis on tradition; yet it was at least partly stimulated by the rediscovery of classical scholarship from Greece and Rome. The reading of classical authors brought many Latin and Greek words into English, and occasioned the respelling of many French loanwords acquired during the previous centuries, according to their classical antecedents. (See further under spelling section 1.) The relationship between renaissance and renascence is in fact the opposite – symbolic of the modern era in which classical culture is no longer privileged."

		"title": "renege or renegue",
		"explanation":"Four centuries after its first appearance, this word still seems a misfit, with its spelling and pronunciation at odds. Its nearest relative in English is renegade, though reneg(u)e itself seems to be a clipped form of the medieval Latin verb renegare (“deny”). In C16 renege had dire overtones of apostasy, and it was only toward the end of C17 that the word became associated with card-playing and with the frenchified spelling renegue. The general meaning “go back on a promise or commitment” appears toward the end of C18, though there’s scant record of it until C20, and its spelling and pronunciation are still unsettled. \n The Oxford Dictionary (1989) puts renegue ahead of renege as the preferred spelling, and it’s much more satisfactory in terms of the ordinary rules of English spelling, because g followed by an e is normally a “soft” sound (see -ce/-ge). Yet renege is overwhelmingly preferred in both British and American English, by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE. Renege is less unsatisfactory as a spelling when you pronounce the word with a long vowel as “rineeg” or “rinayg,” as the British do. But most Americans, Canadians and Australians pronounce it with a short vowel. Merriam-Webster (2000) lists “rinig” and “rineg” ahead of “rineeg”/“rinayg,” as the four possible pronunciations. Garner (1998) notes (without any citations) that contemporary Americans sometimes spell it renig, a spelling which goes back to C18, according to the Oxford. From its links with renegade and renegare, we might also expect the spelling reneg, but it has only been recorded once or twice. \n The general consensus is to use renege whatever the pronunciation. It entails the inflected forms reneged and reneging, registered in all dictionaries – and we must grin and bear them. On the other hand, we could take affirmative action with the Oxford Dictionary, and use renegue, renegued and reneguing – in the interests of bringing the renegade into line!"

	{
		"title": "repertoire or repertory",
		"explanation":"At bottom these are the same word, in their French and Latin-derived forms respectively. Both refer primarily to a stock of items which can be performed. The latinate repertory is the older of the two by three centuries, borrowed in C16, and since late C19 associated particularly with amateur theatre and the repertory theatre company, which offers a set of plays for a short season. Repertory has other connections with the stage, referring to the set pieces of other performing groups, in opera, music, dance and other forms of entertainment. Occasionally in the UK and rather more often in the US, it’s used of a notional inventory of skills commanded by groups or persons off-stage, as in an individual’s repertory of gestures or Florida’s culinary repertory. \n Like repertory, repertoire has both on- and off-stage uses. Borrowed from French in C19, it quickly extended itself outside the theatre and performing hall to include the stock of abilities or skills possessed by a person in almost any field from tennis strokes to coin design, and on to one’s command of ethnic cuisine or scotch whiskies. In scientific use, repertoire is applied to biological behavior, as in the characteristic response repertoire of the species. These extended uses are more frequent in British English, where repertoire is much more widely used than repertory (by more than 3:1 among BNC writers). In American English repertoire is apparently less popular than repertory, by the evidence of CCAE."

		"title": "repetition",
		"explanation":"The repetition of any word or phrase in a short space of writing draws attention to it. In a narrative the repeated he or she is the focus of the action; and in nonfiction a set of key words may be repeated throughout the text because they are essential to the subject. If the writing is technical they must be repeated: technical terms cannot be paraphrased without losing the specific point of reference. A certain amount of repetition is also important as part of the network of cohesion in any kind of writing (see further under coherence or cohesion). \n Apart from those functional reasons for repeating words and phrases, there may be stylistic or rhetorical ones. This is what gave and still gives great power to Abraham Lincoln’s archetypal statement about American democracy, that it was: \n government of the people, for the people, by the people . . . \n The repetition of “people” is made all the more conspicuous by being couched in parallel phrasing. (See further under parallel constructions.) \n Yet repetition is sometimes accidental, or not well motivated. Writers get into a verbal groove when they should be seeking fresh ways of expressing an idea. A thesaurus offers a treasury of alternative words, though many of those grouped together are not synonyms and need to be checked for meaning and stylistic consistency. Fork out means “pay” everywhere in the world, but it’s suitable only for informal contexts. \n Repetition can be avoided also by varying the grammar of the sentence. Many verbs, nouns and adjectives have partners which can be pressed into service, with slight rearrangements of other words around them: \n The demonstrators were protesting about a new road tax. \n Truck drivers demonstrated yesterday about a new road tax. \n A new road tax was the focus of yesterday’s downtown demonstration. \n The choice of an alternative word form (demonstrator/demonstrate/demonstration) stimulates a different order and structure for the clause, and creates slots for new information – all of which help to vary your expression. Alternative function words are discussed in various entries in this book: see especially conjunctions and relative pronouns."

		"title": "repetitious or repetitive",
		"explanation":"Both adjectives represent the noun repetition, but do they hold the same view of it? Either can appear in negative collocations such as boring or repetitious work, repetitive and mind-numbing tasks. Yet in repetitive the focus is more often on the repeated pattern itself, as in repetitive DNA or repetitive strain injury (RSI), and so it’s inherently more neutral. That apart, repetitive is rather more frequent than repetitious in both American and British English. In CCAE data repetitive outnumbers repetitious by about 3:1, and the ratio in the BNC is 15:1. This accords with the Oxford Dictionary’s early C20 view that repetitious was “more common in American usage,” and the fact that it goes back to C17, whereas repetitive is a C19 innovation. But repetitive is clearly the more widely used of the two now."

		"title": "replace, substitute and substituted",
		"explanation":"The underlying verbs are complementary, in that replace means “take the place of ” and substitute (for), “put in place of.” So the following statements amount to the same thing: \n  Tom Tough replaced Ray Rough in Saturday’s football match. \n The manager substituted Tom Tough for Ray Rough. \n In passive constructions, the two can also complement each other: \n Ray Rough was replaced by Tom Tough \n “had his place taken by” \n Tom Tough was substituted for Ray Rough \n “took the place of ” \n But in other passive contructions, substituted means “(was) replaced.” It may or may not be followed by with or by: \n Reserves can be substituted between rounds. Goddard’s anger at being substituted suggests all is not well with the team. \n ...70% of present fuel consumption could be substituted by use of battery vehicles \n This passive use of substituted is particularly common in sports reporting, but not confined to it, as the last example shows. There are others in technical and everyday writing in the BNC. The construction is not new. Its record began in C17, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), though the Dictionary’s note, “now regarded as incorrect,” was taken up with a vengeance by Fowler (1926), and the second edition of the Dictionary simply labels it “incorrect.” The New Oxford (1998) restores it to grace with a careful note: “now generally regarded as part of normal standard English.” Merriam-Webster (2000) simply lists the meaning “replace” for substitute without comment, and CCAE contains ample evidence of its use in American English. \n If we accept the contrasting meanings of substitute(d), do they ever cause confusion? Not when followed by a preposition, because for makes it mean “put in place of,” and by or with, “replace.” Without a preposition, the second meaning may not come across to those unfamiliar with the sporting register. So there’s still a case for using replace or an active form of substitute instead: \n Tom Tough substituted for Ray Rough on Saturday. \n This is the intransitive counterpart of the construction used at the start of this entry (see transitive and intransitive). It stands clear of the complications with the passive and the interplay with replace. The boundaries between replace and substitute/substituted are not fixed, and need careful negotiation – as with other reciprocal pairs (see under reciprocal words)."

		"explanation":"In their simplest form reports give a retrospective view of an enterprise. Written with the advantage of hindsight, they can offer a perspective on what’s more and less important – not a “blow by blow” account of events, but one structured to help readers see the implications. \n Apart from reviewing the past, reports written in the name of industry and government are expected to develop a strategic plan and recommendations for the future. An environmental impact study for example normally begins with an extended description of the existing environment and its physical, biological and social character. This is followed by discussions of the likely impact of any proposed development on all facets of the site, and then by sets of alternative recommendations. \n  Structuring reports. When writing a report it’s important to identify the purpose of the investigation, so as to focus the document and define its scope. This prevents it from going in all directions, and from being swollen with irrelevant material. A specific brief may have been supplied for the report (e.g. to examine the causes of frequent lost-time injuries in the machine shop). If not, it’s a good idea to compile your own brief, and to include it at the front of the report, to show the conceptual framework within which the work has been done. If recommendations and a management plan are the expected outcome of a report, these too need to be presented in summary form at the front (often called an executive summary), before you go into the details of the inquiry on which they are based. \n Any longer report (say more than five pages) needs a table of contents on the first page, to show readers where to go for answers to any particular question. The format for reports in government and industry is not standardized (as it is in science), and common sense is your guide in creating a logical structure (e.g. presenting discussion of the status quo before ideas for the future). Within those broad sections, subsections with informative headings need to be devised, ones which can also be used in the table of contents. Tables of statistics are usually housed in an appendix if they occupy full pages, though shorter ones may be included where the discussion refers to them. \n 2 Science reports are written to a conventional format – the so-called IMRAD structure which consists of Introduction, Method, Results (and) Discussion, in that order. Two other details to note are that the Method may be subdivided into subjects, apparatus and procedures; and that the report’s conclusions may be appended to the end of the Discussion, or else set apart with their own heading: Conclusions. The IMRAD format ensures that scientific experiments and investigations are reported in such a way as to be replicable, and allow the reader to separate the facts of the research (the method, results) from their interpretation (discussion/conclusions). The science reporting format is also the basic structure for articles in scholarly journals, and for empirical theses and dissertations. \n 3 Writing style in reports is necessarily rather formal. Whether written in the name of science or government or industry, they are expected to provide objective and judicious statements on the data examined, and responsible conclusions. They are not a natural vehicle for personal attitudes and values. \n Yet the writing style of reports need not be dull or overloaded with passives and institutional clich´es (see further under passive verbs and impersonal style). To ensure directness and clarity of style, it always helps to think of the people you’re trying to communicate with through the report. Imagine them looking for answers to their questions. Readers are interested in clear, positive analysis – not in hedged statements and tentative conclusions. They respond to vitality in style, and to any attempts to supplement the written word with diagrams and visual aids. See further under Plain English."

This is not a spelling mistake, since the word has its own derivation direct from the Latin recisio(n)- (“cutting back.”) Recision and rescission appear in equal numbers in data from CCAE, whereas rescission stands alone in the BNC. This explains why Merriam-Webster (2000) registers both words, whereas New Oxford (1998) has only rescission. Meanwhile the Oxford Dictionary (1989) keeps the record for recision up to the end of C19 and a note saying that it was/is “now rare.” It seems to have dropped out of British English. \n The case for recision does not extend to the spellings recission or rescision, used in earlier centuries, and also reported in the US by Garner (1998), but without actual citations."

It survives in the phrase last resort, a “course of action adopted under difficult circumstances,” and occasionally as a verb meaning “apply to for help.” The verb resort is built into phrases such as resorted to and without resorting to, where its closeness to without recourse to may challenge your sense of idiom. \n Resource is primarily a noun, used to refer to a means or source of supply in many contexts ranging from mineral resources to resources for teaching.

The word was borrowed into C18 English in its French form restaurateur, and this is still the dominant form in print, but the more anglicized form restauranteur has gained ground during C20, probably because it clarifies the link with restaurant, its nearest relative in English. Though purists might dub it “folk etymology,” the spelling adjustment is helpful rather than distracting in this instance (see further under folk etymology). \n Restauranteur is acknowledged as an alternative form in Merriam-Webster (2000), and the citations in Webster’s English Usage (1989) go back to 1926. There it’s described as a “standard secondary variant,” common in speech; and CCAE contains a sprinkling of examples of it. Both the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) list it as an alternative. But restauranteur struggles for acceptance in the UK. The New Oxford (1998) acknowledges its existence as “a common misspelling,” occurring in 20% of cases in the BNC.

In English usage the sense of “balking” is rare, and almost all examples of restive in the BNC and CCAE refer to people “impatient for action.”"

This usage originated in North America, but is current and widespread elsewhere – listed without comment in New Oxford (1998). For the contents of a resume´, see under curriculum vitae. \n Note that resum ´ e´ often appears with only one accent (on the last syllable). Resume´ is in fact the form of the headword in New Oxford. The double-accented form appears in examples, and the form with no accents at all is noted as a US alternative. But Merriam-Webster (2000) is surprisingly traditional on this, making the double-accented form resum ´ e´ its headword and the other two its alternatives. It seems unlikely that American writers are more inclined than the British to preserve French accents. Resume´ is a useful compromise, sufficient to distinguish it from the verb resume. English pronunciation normally gives a short vowel to the first syllable, according to New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000). This makes the first accent rather artificial, however proper it is in French."

		"title": "reticent and reluctant",
		"explanation":"These two stand apart in their essential senses: reticent means “disinclined to speak” while reluctant means just “disinclined.” However the first is increasingly taking on the sense of the second in the phrases reticent to and reticent about: \n I am reticent to ask for help more than once. \n The banks are reticent about admitting fraud is a problem. \n As these examples show, the newer use of reticent begins where its use involves a slight tautology, overlapping with a following verb for speaking. This effectively weasels meaning out of reticent, so that it focuses on a reluctance to speak (or act) rather than the lack of verbal action. In more developed examples, there is no act of speaking at all: \n Lots of people are reticent to go into public life. \n He was as reticent about having people to his home as ever. \n This use of reticent to mean “reluctant” is emerging in both British and American English, though it may have begun in the US. Webster’s English Usage (1989) traces its use in reticent to from the 1950s, and Burchfield (1996) confirms it with British examples of reticent about from the 1990s. Their respective findings underscore a small point of regional difference: that the construction reticent about is more common in British English, and reticent to in American. The BNC provides almost four times as many examples of reticent about as reticent to, whereas reticent to is the regular American construction in data from CCAE. Examples reported in Canada (Fee and McAlpine, 1997) and Australia (Peters, 2001b), also involve reticent to. The adapted meaning of reticent associated with these constructions is registered in Merriam-Webster’s (2000), but not in New Oxford (1998). Burchfield nevertheless comments that “it has the air of inevitability about it.” The fact that these developments for reticent also apply to the noun reticence underscores his point."

Either way, it has quickly spread from dress (retro chic) to music (retro rock), to food, furniture and forms of exercise, at least in the US.

		"explanation":"Dictionaries all allow that revenge can be a verb or a noun. Yet databases both American and British show that it mostly appears as a noun, as in desire for revenge or phrasal verbs such as get/have/seek/take revenge. These phrasal verbs seem in fact to substitute for its use as a simple verb. The role of verb is also taken up by avenge, used of persons reacting to injuries and insults, whether suffered by others or by themselves: \n We must avenge our dead. \n  . . . a desire to avenge himself in its columns in later years \n Avenge is gaining figurative uses as in that second example, and in sports reporting: \n They are out to avenge last season’s defeat. \n The policy of reserving avenge for justifiable retaliation carried out by a third party is not “absolutely observed” (as indicated in Webster’s Third, 1986, and a usage note carried over from the Oxford Dictionary’s first edition to its second, 1989). It would depend somewhat on your point of view, as Fowler (1926) commented. The nouns revenge and vengeance are also sometimes said to be differentiated on the basis that the first means retaliatory action carried out by the injured party, and the second the retribution carried out by a third party. Compare: \n . . . an author taking his revenge \n . . . claimed as vengeance for the massacre of worshippers . . . \n The ritual connotations of vengeance are underpinned for some by biblical statements such as: \n Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord (Romans 12:19) \n Yet vengeance is heavily secularized in database evidence. It appears in reference to cycles of violence and vengeance, to bloody crime and popular vengeance, and pleas for justice, not vengeance – where it clearly doesn’t refer to any “just retribution.” There’s none in the Personal Vengeance software, which allows you to act out primitive responses to career frustrations. Though vengeance retains its emotional force in examples like those, that too is diluted in the single most common use of the word, in with a vengeance. It accounts for almost half the instances of the word in BNC data and more than a third in CCAE. For example: \n Coupes are back with a vengeance.  \n´ I took up dancing again with a vengeance. \n Cllich´ed and casual use of the phrase undermines its point in more purposeful expression: \n This was political education with a vengeance. \n With a vengeance would be the phrase to avoid, if you want to exploit the full force of vengeance."

But the question of the plural for rhinoceros becomes rather academic with increasing use of the abbreviation rhino. In both British and American databases, rhino occurs far more often than the rhinoceros, in references to the animal as well as its fabled attributes, in rhino horn and the expression like a rampant rhino. Its plural rhinos takes its place – just like the full form – alongside references to other wild game. Compare: \n . . . 3000 gazelle live here, as well as elephants, rhinos, buffalo, lions... \n Other species [to see] are elephants, buffalo, rhinoceros, impala, giraffe. \n As the examples show, any such list of species may contain both regular and zero plurals, though the preference for zero plurals is more typical of serious environmental writing."

		"title": "rhotic",
		"explanation":"English dialects diverge over whether “r” is pronounced when it occurs after a vowel and before another consonant or at the end of words such as bird, door, ear, perk, tar, thorn. This makes them either rhotic or nonrhotic. The rhotic dialects that pronounce “r” are located especially in the far north and west of the UK, in Ireland and widespread in North America (including Canada), excluding only New England and the Deep South. The nonrhotic group includes southern and eastern British English, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Rhotic speakers of English outnumber the nonrhotic in the world at large, and rhoticity is therefore built into the so-called “mid-Atlantic” form of English (see under mid-Atlantic and mid-Atlantic English). But for second-language learners, the choice of rhotic or nonrhotic models would be best decided on the basis of their mother tongues, as suggested by McArthur (2001). Rhoticity would come naturally to speakers of Romance and Arabic languages, whereas nonrhoticity would be more consistent with Chinese and Japanese. Either way it impinges little on written International English, except in the sets of homophones that depend on the presence or absence of “r,” and may subliminally affect one’s writing. Thus fort and fought are homophones for nonrhotic speakers, but distinct for rhotic speakers."

		"title": "rhyme or rime",
		"explanation":"This word for a pattern of sounds was spelled rime for centuries, going back to C13. Rhyme made its debut in C17 as an alternative spelling, and like many respellings of the time, it linked the word with a putative classical ancestor – in this case the Greek rhythmos. This would give rhyme and rhythm a common source, despite the very different aspects of prosody that they refer to. More recent etymology finds the source for rhyme in the Germanic word “rim” meaning “number,” which is also associated with accentual verse and its terminal rhyme. This sense of the word seems to have been borrowed into Old French (as rime), and then into C13 English, to refer to “rhymed verse.” These complex origins were obscure to English Renaissance scholars, who could only suggest the connection with rhythmos. \n The English respelling of rime as rhyme took some time to catch on, and rime was still current in late C18, hence its use in Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Rime enjoyed a brief after-life amid the Anglo-Saxon literary revival of later C19, but the spelling rhyme was by then too well established in common usage. Etymologically it’s inaccurate, yet it serves to distinguish the prosodic word from its homonym rime (“hoar frost”). \n Though full rhyme is the hallmark of verse and many kinds of poetry, half rhyme is occasionally used by prose writers to create patterned effects (see assonance). Initial rhyme is another resource for underscoring verbal connections in prose: see alliteration."

		"title": "rhyming slang",
		"explanation":"Informal expressions for many everyday things have been created by rhyming slang, and they lend variety to the all-too-familiar. The rubbity dub makes a change from “club” or “pub,” and egg flip for a gambling “tip.” Some rhyming slang puts on airs, as does eau de cologne for “phone” and aristotle for “bottle” – until it’s cut down to size as “Arry.” Rhyming slang provides ways of skirting round a problem, such as Farmer Giles for “piles” and bang and biff (“syph[ilis]”). The close ties between rhyming slang and a particular community make for different meanings in different places. A Captain Cook means a “book” in the UK, but a “look” in both the US and Australia. Local identity is expressed in the different terms coined for the same object: thus Hampsteads (from Hampstead Heath) serves for “teeth” in the UK, and Barrier Reef in Australia. \n The examples show how rhyming slang selects a phrase of two or three words to highlight the key word, with the rhyming phrase often an amusing distractor rather than a clue to the key word. A few such as trouble and strife (for “wife”) and bottle and stopper (for “copper”) are less oblique. Yet the amusement of most rhyming slang is its seeming irrelevance to what’s being referred to, making it hard for the uninitiated to know what is meant. The habit of abbreviating the rhyming phrase to the first word, and making it an ordinary countable noun, as in Hampsteads or elephants (elephant’s trunk for “drunk”), also helps to disguise the reference. \n Rhyming slang is certainly for those in the know, and works to exclude outsiders. Once such phrases become well known they lose that value and the major motive for their use. This is why few rhyming slang terms – as far as we know – ever establish themselves in the standard language."

		"title": "rhythm",
		"explanation":"Rhythm in prose is certainly no regular rhythm as in poetry (see rhyme). In good writing rhythm is subtly pervasive yet noticeable only here and there. Its effect is wave-like – not the regular pattern of a sound wave, but the infinitely variable movement of waves on the beach, whose shape and size vary with contextual factors. The sentences in a piece of writing can be likened to individual waves in their rise and resolution on the shore. Each wave has a clear crest to mark its place in the continuous pattern. In the same way, every sentence needs a clear focus if it’s to contribute to the rhythm and momentum of the prose. Shapeless sentences with blurred focus are unsatisfactory in terms of rhythm as well as meaning. Very long sentences often impair the rhythm unless they are carefully constructed. Yet too many short choppy sentences can also disturb the deeper rhythms of prose. \n  Rhythm, variety and balance Continuous variety in sentence length is an important factor in maintaining prose rhythm, provided each one is focused and balanced in its internal structure. \n In Australia alone is to be found the grotesque, the weird, the strange scribblings of nature learning how to write. Some see no beauty in our trees without shade, our flowers without perfume, our birds who cannot fly, and our beasts who have not yet learned to walk on all fours. But the dweller in the wilderness acknowledges the subtle charms of the fantastic land of monstrosities. He becomes familiar with the beauty of loneliness. Whispered to by the myriad tongues of the wilderness, he learns the language of the barren and the uncouth, and can read the hieroglyphs of the haggard gumtrees, blown into odd shapes, distorted with fierce hot winds, and cramped with cold nights, when the Southern Cross freezes in a cloudless sky of icy blue. (Marcus Clarke, 1876) \n The passage shows the skilled writer at work, controlling the shape and balance of sentences. Balance is achieved in the first sentence by inversion of the subject and predicate. The sentence would lose almost everything if it ran: \n In Australia alone the grotesque, the weird, and the strange scribblings of nature learning how to write are to be found... \n With so much to digest before we reach the verb, it puts a severe strain on short-term memory. The pile-up of phrases has the effect of smothering the latent rhythm, until the sentence lets us down with an abrupt jolt at the end. Instead Clarke balances material on either side of the verb. The passage also shows how sentence rhythm depends on effective use of the phrase and clause. Note the parallel phrases in the second and fifth sentences which help to create a satisfying rhythm and to control the flow of information. \n 2 Rhythm and the rhetoric of the series. The connection between phrasing and rhythm can also be seen in the different effects of combining two, three and four items. When just two are coordinated, the effect is neat, tidy and final, as in. \n We are at once, instrument and end, discoverers and teachers, actors and observers. (J. Robert Oppenheimer, 1953) \n The effect of three coordinated items is more expansive, suggesting both amplitude and adequacy Their effect is illustrated in the following sentence \n I speak of the American in the singular, as if there were not millions of them, north and south, east and west, of both sexes, of all ages, and of various races, professions and religions. (George Santayana, 1920) \n The three matched phrases each introduced by “of ” create a breadth of reference points, as of a subject fully considered. Part of the effect is the careful grading of the three items, each one a little weightier than the one before, so that it creates a kind of cadence. The triplet within the final item shows the same expansive effect. \n Different again is the effect of combining four (or more) items in a series. A sizable series creates its own local rhythm, and temporarily suspends that of the host sentence – just as the quartet of information seems designed to overwhelm the reader, and to represent a kind of rhetorical pleading: \n The lion may lie down with the lamb, or at least cease eating it; but when will the royalist lie down with the republican, the Quaker with the ritualist, the Deist with the Atheist, the Roman Catholic with the Anglo-Catholic or either of them with the Protestant... (George Bernard Shaw, 1944) \n Shaw’s use of lists and extended parallelism like this are a feature of his argumentative prose. \n Even from the printed page, the rhythmic effects of well-crafted prose strike the ear and reinforce the message of the words. The key to writing rhythmical prose is tuning in to the sound of one’s own sentences."

		"explanation":"Though both words go back to Old English, right has a place in many more idioms and styles than rightly. It carries a range of meanings in its various grammatical roles as adjective, noun and verb, and as a multi-faceted adverb in zero form (see zero adverbs). Rightly is the regular adverbial form, and generally keeps its distance, with the meaning “properly,” “justifiably,” as in: \n You rightly suggest that they be included in the team. \n He was rightly angered at the lack of action. \n However rightly and right compete in a few idioms when both mean “correctly”: \n If I remember rightly, the train arrives at 5pm. \n If I remember right, the train arrives at 5pm. \n The choice between right and rightly, meaning “correct,” is a matter of style, right being the less formal of the two (like any zero adverb). Note also how right when it modifies a verb comes after it, whereas rightly appears either after or before. \n In other adverbial roles not shared with rightly, right always precedes the word or phrase that it modifies. This is so when it means “exactly,” as in: \n The school is right there. \n They should appear right this minute. \n Uses of right to modify expressions of time and place are particularly common in American English, according to research reported in the Longman Grammar (1999), whereas British speakers are more inclined to use just. For both Americans and the British, the use of right as an adverbial modifier shades into its use as an intensifier: The boat was right out to sea. \n In conversation right appears on its own in several discourse roles. It solicits agreement, as in: \n You’re coming with us. Right? \n It works as an affirmative, indicating understanding and/or compliance: \n It’s a first step. // Right \n Right can also signal a new phase of conversation: \n The visitors will be here tomorrow. Right, let’s discuss the catering. \n These adverbial uses of right in conversation complement those of right as adjective, though interference between them sometimes causes problems: \n At the next intersection you take a left turn. // Right! // No, not a right turn... \n Such problems are not so likely in written communication, because it makes less use of adverbial right and rather more of the adjectival. In frequencies from the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus, right ranks very high among adjectives for both predicative and attributive use (see adjectives section 1): \n He was right in believing... (predicative) \n ... doesn’t give the right answer... (attributive) \n The grammatical frame in which right occurs as an adjective usually clarifies its meaning."

In standard English the past tense is rang and the past participle rung, distinctions which are generally maintained in writing.

The form rung is recorded in about 40% of cases of the past tense in the transcribed speech of the BNC, yet not acknowledged even in cautionary notes in New Oxford (1998). Webster’s Dictionary (1986) simply presents rung as the less common form of the past tense in American English, and Webster’s English Usage (1989) adds the fact that it’s more often heard than seen in print.

The English adjective risky, dating from the 1820s, took on the same range of ordinary applications. \n Risque´ is of course the same adjective borrowed freshly from French in the 1870s; and its spelling and accent draw attention to what the English always attribute to the French, namely a ready attention to matters of sexuality. A risque joke ´ has sexual implications and comes close to the limits of what can be shared at a polite dinner party – though what seems risque´ to some would not raise eyebrows among others. The place that offers a $100-a-bottle whisky and risque floor show ´ may in fact be using risque´ to cover anything from the raunchy to the pornographic. The word risque´ is a “red light” in both senses – a “no-go” signal as well as a lure. The ambivalence of risque´ lends itself to titillating but not scintillating journalism, as in references to a prince’s string of risque affairs. ´ Risky was/is occasionally substituted for risque´, according to most dictionaries, as in a risky sense of humor. But the need to use risky as a euphemism for risque´ has probably passed. \n In American English risque´ frequently appears without an accent (as risque) by the evidence of CCAE, and the Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes it as an alternative.

The word street still predominates in the nomenclature of many capital cities for the same reason. But in Manhattan (New York City), street is used systematically for roads going east–west, and avenue for those running north–south, as also to a lesser extent in Chicago. The word avenue (like boulevard) comes from French, and originally referred to a tree-lined street, though the trees tend to be casualties of urban development. These days streets, roads, avenues, boulevards are intermingled in the nomenclature of most English-speaking cities, without discernible patterns. The one regular distinction left is that lane designates a minor, narrow way, often adjacent to a major road of the same name. Compare Collins Street with Collins Lane in Melbourne."

The plural of roman a clef ` is romans a clef ` , according to the French convention (see plurals section 2). But in English roman a clef ` is also pluralized as roman a` clefs, found by Google (2002) in about 1 in 5 English-language documents on the internet.

		"title": "Roman numerals or roman numerals",
		"explanation":"In general usage, the adjective Roman tends to be capitalized, and this is the form listed in dictionaries. But in editorial circles both British and American, references to both roman and arabic (numerals) are written without capital letters (see Copy-editing, 1992; Chicago Manual, 2003). In British editorial circles, Roman numerals are also called roman numbers. \n The key symbols in the roman numbering system are: \n : I (1) V (5) X (10) L (50) C (100) D (500) M (1000) \n All intervening numbers can be created by combinations of those letters. The values are essentially created by subtraction from the left and addition on the right of the key symbols. Thus the lower symbol, e.g., I, is subtracted in IV (4) but added in VI (6). Both principles are worked in numbers such as in XLIX (49), and in MCMXC (1990). \n Because of their variable length, Roman numerals raise questions of alignment. When they appear in continuous vertical lists, they are aligned on the left, i.e. the opposite of arabic numerals, according to the Chicago Manual. But when used for the purposes of enumeration, they are often aligned to the right, to avoid a ragged right effect next to the start of the regular text. (See further under numbers and number style sections 5, 6, 7.) \n Roman numerals are frequently used in paginating the preliminary pages of a book, as well as the foreword, preface or introduction.

		"title": "rosary or rosery",
		"explanation":"Both involve roses. The rosary or set of beads used to tally personal prayers in the Catholic Church is figuratively a “necklace or garland of roses.” It comes from the Latin rosarium (“rose garden”), which was its first meaning in C15 English. By the end of C16 its now standard meanings of “prayer beads” and “set of prayers” were established. It normally appears without a capital letter in rosary beads and in reference to private devotions, but may be capitalized when referring to the formal saying of the rosary as at funeral services. \n With rosary called to higher duty, rose-fanciers were left without a distinctive name for the rose garden – until the C19 coining of rosery out of English elements (rose + -ery, along the lines of orangery). Rosery and rosary are sometimes mistakenly used for each other, like other -ery/-ary words, though their etymologies help to keep them apart. See further under -ary/-ery/-ory."

		"title": "route or rout",
		"explanation":"These words are differently pronounced (with “oo” and “ow” respectively) by the British and by many Americans, and so keep their distance. But they converge in print when used with verb endings. Compare: \n All traffic was routed down the main line (route) New Zealand routed Zimbabwe in the second innings (rout) \n The subject helps to fix the meaning of routed in each case: as “set [a] course” in the first case, and “drive [others] into retreat” or “defeat” in the second. Another, technical meaning of rout (“cut a groove [in a wood or metal surface]”) can also be loaded onto routed. \n It’s been routed from a solid block of wood. \n Here too, the context helps to settle the meaning, and is indispensable, given that no alternative spelling is available with the -ed inflection. \n With the -ing inflection, the spelling routeing is available to distinguish route from rout, though it breaks the normal spelling rule for a final e (see -e section 1). New Oxford (1998) makes it the primary choice for route, but it’s not at all popular with British writers represented in the BNC, who mostly plump for the regular routing. Again the context, and collocations such as routing system and routing traffic through..., generally help to clarify the meaning. In American English, routing alone is used according to Merriam-Webster (2000), and it’s the only spelling found in data from CCAE for all three senses."

		"title": "Royal or royal",
		"explanation":"To decapitalize royal is not a capital offence. There are good reasons for doing so; and in the Langscape survey (1998–2001), over half the respondents (53%) worldwide said that they would only “sometimes” put a capital letter on the regal word. Add to that the one third (33%) who said that they would “never” do so, and you may wonder whether republicanism is rampant. \n Many generic expressions with royal do not require a capital, such as the colors royal blue/purple, the writer’s royal we, or anyone’s royal road to success. References to a royal adviser/delegation/family/ palace/visit are similarly left without capitals, whether they are associated with the British or any other sovereign. In context there’s usually little doubt which sovereign is meant, and the capital would add nothing to the Hawaiian royal house, or to the note that Queen Elizabeth has visited it, and many of her royal kin. Only the tabloid-led Royal-watchers, looking for a scoop on the Royals, seem to insist on capitalizing references to the British royal family. The capital is of course required in expressions like Royal Highness and Princess Royal, because they are official titles. \n Royal is most regularly found with a capital in the names of institutions in the UK and overseas which enjoy royal patronage. For example: Royal Navy, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. These high-profile institutions help to explain why a minority of respondents (15%) to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) said that they would “always” capitalize the word. But among the countless royal institutions, there are cases which may or may not need to be capitalized. As a generic expression royal commission needs no capitals, but as part of the full title it does, as in the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (1979). Abbreviated references to that particular commission would still be capitalized in British style: The Royal Commission rejected that solution; whereas in American style it would probably be decapitalized (see capital letters section 3). The term royal assent, whereby legislation is signed into law (by the British sovereign or the governor-general or state governors in Commonwealth countries), is regularly found in lower case, and listed that way by dictionaries. Idioms whose connection with royalty is metaphorical are always lower-cased, e.g. the royal jelly on which potential queen bees are fed, and the royal flush of a lucky poker player, i.e. the winning hand with all the courtly cards, plus the ace and the ten. \n The numerous uses of royal without a capital are of course neutral in terms of loyalty to royalty, though they still remind us of the further reaches of monarchical management.

By the end of C19 it had developed its own set of rules and a formal governing body, the Rugby Union. Until very recently (1995) it was an avowedly amateur sport, whereas the Rugby League splintered off from the Union in the 1890s, and allowed professionalism. The two games otherwise differ slightly in the number of players per side, and in a few rules and points of scoring. The term rugger used to be applied to rugby union, but is now generalized to either game, and both suffer from the attentions of rugger enthusiasts/fans. The same goes for the rugger bugger (a South African term at home in British English since the 1970s). All words are normally written in lower case."

The question of whether to run in or take down also arises with longish headings and captions, and in the choice between horizontal and vertical lists (see lists). British editors use run on rather than run in, as do their counterparts in Canada and Australia. \n Dictionary-makers everywhere use the term run-on(s) to refer to the additional form(s) of a word at the end of an entry, as when the entry for rustic (adjective) adds rustically (adverb) without defining it at the end.

Yet many of the words with -ry are centuries old, and we have no record of them with -ery. \n One noticeable feature of words ending in -ry is that they very often have three syllables, and some scholars believe that the -ry helped to maintain this pattern, in words which might otherwise have had four syllables: \n artistry bigotry devilry husbandry pedantry \n punditry ribaldry rivalry wizardry \n  Compare: \n archery brewery butchery printery \n robbery smeltery tannery \n where three syllables are maintained through the coincidence of -er and -ery. And \n eatery finery greenery \n popery shrubbery thievery \n where a single syllable is built up to three with the full -ery suffix.

		"explanation":"The letter s was the last to acquire a standardized shape in English printing. Well into C18, it had different shapes according to its position in a word. As the first letter or somewhere in the middle, its shape was rather like an f. In roman type this type of s had only a half cross stroke (just on the left side) as in fit and feat. In italic it was printed with a descender below the line – the so-called “long s”as in fit and feat. At the end of a word, in both roman and italic type, the letter s had the serpentine shape we use today: sits/seats. The different forms of lower case s helped to show when it belonged to the stem of the word, and when it was an inflection (see next two entries). But the capital s was always serpentine, and probably helped to fix the shape for the lower case."

		"title": "-s",
		"explanation":"This is the most important inflection in English. Paradoxically it marks the singular of the present tense of verbs, and the plural of most nouns. These inflectional uses of -s, and others where it is more derivational (see suffixes section 2), are discussed below. \n 1 All verbs except modals have -s to mark the third person singular present tense, as in dances, rocks, rolls, sings and many more. The variant form -es is applied to verbs ending in o, (s)s, sh, (t)ch, x, y or (z)z, of English or foreign origin: \n echoes hisses finishes clutches lurches \n fixes denies buzzes \n 2 The -s inflection marks the plural of almost all nouns that go back to Old English, and all assimilated loanwords, including sticks and stones, oranges and lemons, armadillos and aardvarks. The -es variant is applied to nouns ending in o or y (see -o and -y>-i-); and in (s)s, sh, (t)ch, x or (z)z: \n glasses dishes churches \n patches taxes quizzes \n Nouns which do not take -(e)s are usually very recent loans, such as kibbutzim, or else ones which preserve their foreign plurals either for scholarly reasons (phenomena) or because of the cachet attached to them (gateaux). See further under plurals. \n Other minor uses of -s, for certain kinds of derivation. These include its use as: \n * a marker of familiarity (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985), in expressions such as the guilts, up for grabs, got the runs/trots, gone bananas, and words such as bonkers, jitters, shakes, starters. Though some of these can be analyzed as plurals and/or as the names of diseases (Wickens, 1992), they do seem to make a distinct set in terms of their informal tone and the variety of their derivations. These they also share with the “nursery” terms used in talking with infants, e.g. beddie-byes, cuddles, dindins, and also the affectionate forms of personal names (Mabs, Suzykins, Wooz): see M ¨uhlh¨ausler (1983). * a collective marker for something composite, whether the elements it consists of are all of one kind, as with amends, arrears, dregs; or various, as with cleaners, headquarters, printers. The latter have traditionally been analyzed – often awkwardly – as elliptical forms of the genitive (see further under local genitive). But clearly they are no ordinary plurals, given that they can be construed in the singular, as in the cleaners/printers is on the corner. Rather they seem to embody a collective use of -s (see further under pluralia tantum). \n * adverbial marker, as in Fridays, unawares, westwards etc., especially in British English (see further under -ward). The -s ending once marked many more adverbs in English."

		"title": "-s/-ss-",
		"explanation":"Several kinds of English words are affected by the issue of whether to write one or two ss at the boundary of the stem and affix. Nouns and verbs ending in -s raise this question when their -es inflections are to be added, though usage generally does not double the s (with minor exceptions: see below). When the double is created by a prefix ending in -s before a stem beginning with s, -ss- is usually retained. \n 1 Nouns ending in a single -s. The question of whether to double the s before adding the plural -es depends on the number of syllables. Those consisting of two or more syllables never double it: \n atlases biases irises \n proboscises surpluses thermoses \n This applies also to Latin loanwords ending in -us, such as cactus(es), focus(es) and syllabus(es), whenever they have English plurals (see -us section 1). Even with nouns of one syllable, the pattern is normally the same: buses, gases, pluses. Spellings with -ss- are the secondary ones in each case (see further under bus, gas, plus). \n 2 Verbs ending in -s show a little more variability. The regular rules (see under doubling of final consonant) apply in cases like: \n biased chorused focused \n portcullised trellised \n Though biassed and focussed are still seen sometimes, their use has steadily declined in the UK as well as the US, according to Sigley’s (1999) research on corpora from the 1960s and 1990s. Only in Australia and New Zealand do the double s spellings still make around 25% of all usage of the past forms. With -ssspellings, the present tense of those verbs (biasses, focusses) jousts with the single s used for their plural nouns: biases, focuses (see further under bias and focus). Verbs of one syllable such as bus and gas normally double the s in British English; whereas in American, bus gets single s and gas the double s (for reasons discussed at bus and gas). On the spelling of canvas and nonplus as verbs, see their respective entries. \n 3 Complex words formed with dis-, mis- or trans- raise similar word-forming questions about setting one s alongside another. In these cases, however, the two ss do not result from any conventional doubling but are integral to the prefix and stem. Spellings with -ss- are perfectly regular for words formed with dis- and mis-, as in: \n dissatisfied disservice dissimilar \n misshapen misspell misstate \n Words formed with trans- are less uniform, and some such as trans(s)hip and trans(s)exual vary between double and single s. Hyphened forms are also recorded in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and New Oxford (1998) makes trans-ship the primary form of the headword, though it’s not registered at all in dictionaries elsewhere. Both Merriam-Webster (2000) and Canadian Oxford (1998) prefer transship, and it’s the most common form in CCAE. The Australian Macquarie (1997) gives preference to the single s spelling tranship, and this is also registered in New Oxford as its second choice. It has a slight edge over both trans-ship and transship in small amounts of data from the BNC. Usage is more convergent over transsexual. The double s (unhyphened) form is prioritized by all dictionaries for transsexual and its derivatives transsexualism/transsexuality, and they are well supported by British and American usage data. Spellings with double s outnumber those with single s by a factor of 3:1 in BNC data, and by more than 90:1 in CCAE. \n Yet single rather than double s is the regular spelling for recent scientific terms such as transonic (trans- + sonic) and transponder (trans- + [re]sponder), as well as transubstantiation, borrowed from medieval Latin. Thus fully blended spellings with trans- occur in both old and recent words, to show that it’s not a matter of age. No single pattern holds for this set – thank goodness it’s a small one."

The spelling sack was and is the standard one for a large woven container for heavy products such as potatoes and wheat. The simpler sac was introduced in C17 to refer to a new, loose-fitting style of gown made fashionable by the French. But in the following century sac was taken up by biologists in its original sense to refer to a small bag-like structure in the anatomy of a plant or animal, and another spelling had to be found for clothing that went by the same name. Enter sacque, a dressed-up form of sac(k) with no roots in French, but with that je ne sais quoi that is the appeal of other frenchified words (see further under frenchification).

In expressions such as the said Gibson or the said premises, it reminds the reader that “Gibson” and particular “premises” have been identified earlier on, and that this reference should be connected with that. In ordinary English the pronouns function this way – though sometimes ambiguously – and so pronouns are studiously avoided in legal writing. We might also note that the sheer length of legal sentences contributes to the danger of ambiguity, and amid the general wordiness of legal prose, even the cohesive devices need to be bulkier. The phrase the said helps to highlight a reference more adequately than a simple pronoun or demonstrative.

		"explanation":"The conventions for writing saints’ names depend on the context: whether it’s a reference to the saint himself or herself, or to an institution or place named after them. \n The names of saints are usually prefaced by Saint in books which describe their life and works. In the indexes to such books the saint’s name is entered alphabetically according to given name, as in \n Thomas Aquinas, Saint \n However those canonized in modern times are alphabetized according to their family name: \n More, Sir Thomas, Saint \n When persons canonized are mentioned incidentally in history books and encyclopedias, their title is usually abbreviated: St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Thomas More. Liturgical publications such as prayer books use either St(.) or the Latin abbreviation S., whose plural is SS with no stop (because it thus becomes a contraction rather than an abbreviation: see contractions section 1). \n When saints’ names are written into those of institutions, the shortened form St(.) is always used (on the use/non-use of the stop see below). Churches are indicated using the abbreviation, as in St. John’s Church, St. Mary’s Cathedral; as well as other associated organizations: Brotherhood of St. Lawrence, St. Vincent de Paul Society. Secularized institutions such as the St. John Ambulance Association and St. Valentine’s Day naturally use the abbreviation. Individuals whose surnames echo a saint’s name: St Clair, St John, again use the abbreviation – as a glance at the metropolitan phone book will confirm. Geographical names which honor a saint are likewise written with St(.): \n St Gotthard Pass \n St Kilda \n St Moritz \n Abbreviated forms like these are used in the gazetteers of world atlases published by The Times and Oxford, among others, and they reflect common usage – pace Webster’s Geographical Dictionary (1997) which uses Saint for all of them. \n 1 Punctuating saints’ names \n * use of full stop / period The shortened form St is normally left unstopped by British writers and editors, because (a) it’s a contraction rather than an abbreviation, and (b) it contains a lower case letter. (For more about these principles, see abbreviations section 1.) North Americans when using a saint’s name usually punctuate it as St., as exemplified in the Chicago Manual (2003): and this style is carried over into placenames (e.g. St. Louis) in encyclopedic dictionaries such as Random House (1987) and the Canadian Oxford Dictionary (1998). \n * apostrophes Placenames containing a saint’s name normally do without an apostrophe before the final s (see apostrophes section 2). However institutions with a saint’s name may use an apostrophe, especially ones like St. Vincent’s Hospital, St. Joseph’s College, which have a religious affiliation. For other institutions, check the telephone directory. \n * hyphen In French, both personal and geographical names keep the word Saint (or Sainte for the feminine equivalent) in full, connecting it with a hyphen to the personal name: \n Sainte-Beuve Saint-Saens ¨ \n  Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts Saint-Germain-des-Pres´ \n Placenames like these are however often abbreviated when they appear in compressed lists, maps and timetables, as: \n Ste-Agathe-des-Monts St-Germain-des-Pres \n In English-speaking Canada, these abbreviations are normally stopped (St., Ste.) whereas in Quebec they are left unstopped, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). \n 2 Indexing names with St(.) Names prefixed with St(.) can be indexed in one of two ways: \n * as if they were spelled out as Saint. They then appear after Sah- in any list, although still abbreviated. Other names involving Saint- are integrated with those with St(.), according to their sixth letter. The order is as follows: \n Sahara Air Conditioning \n St Antony’s Home \n Saint Honore Cake Shop \n St Ignatius College \n St Ives Retirement Village \n * on a strictly alphabetic basis, so that names with St(.) typically follow Sp/Sq in the index (because of the dearth of English words or names beginning with Sr or Ss).This practice separates them from other words/names which have Saint in its full form (which appear after Sah-, as just shown). \n The second system (strictly alphabetic according to the way they are written) is specified in BS 3700, although Butcher’s Copy-editing (1992) suggests that the first may be more appropriate and helpful when the names could be written in more than one way and index-users may not be sure of where to look. Webster’s Style Manual (1985) strongly endorses the first, whereas Chicago Manual (2003) indicates its preference for the second. Both the size of the index, and its purpose need to be considered. \n ♦ Compare the issues in indexing names with Mac/Mc, under Mac or Mc section 2."

		"title": "sake",
		"explanation":"For his sake . . .for my husband’s sake . . . for God’s sake. \n These phrases show that sake normally involves a genitive; and with nouns and names, this means an apostrophe plus s. In the past, the same treatment was accorded to all abstract nouns: \n for pity’s sake,  for mercy’s sake, for goodness’s sake \n However Fowler (1926) noted that the last of those was not regularly written with a final s (usually as goodness’ sake), and that others such as for conscience sake were appearing without even the apostrophe. Both these examples involve common nouns ending in a sibilant (“s” sound), and they pose similar questions to names ending in s, as a letter or a sound. (See apostrophes section 3.) That apart, the phrases are effectively idioms whose meaning is not fully analyzable in terms of individual words, and the genitive construction adds nothing to them. Discarding the apostrophe makes no difference to their meaning, and database evidence shows that most American and many British writers do so. There is no sign of the apostrophe in goodness sake in CCAE, and the phrase is punctuated in only a small proportion of the BNC texts (1 in 4)."

		"title": "salination, salinization, salinisation and salinification",
		"explanation":"During C20 several words were coined for the impact of mineral salts from underground water on agricultural land. The earliest was salinification, registered in Webster’s Dictionary (1911), but now the least used, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. Salinization or salinisation (see -ize/-ise) was first recorded in 1928, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), while salination makes its debut in Webster’s Third (1961). An internet search (Google, 2003) shows that salinization/salinisation is a good deal more popular worldwide than salination, by a factor of 4:1; while salinification makes very little showing. Salination expresses the concept more economically than the others, but is listed only as a run-on to salinisation in the Macquarie Dictionary (1997), and not at all in Merriam-Webster (2000), New Oxford (1998) or the Canadian Oxford (1998). One other point that might lend support to salination is the fact that desalination is far more common than desalinization/desalinisation on the internet, by more than 7:1 (Google, 2003). The two words come up in rather different contexts however: desalination when urban water supplies are under discussion, and salination amid agricultural and environmental concerns."

		"explanation":"At the root of both these adjectives is the notion of good health, yet both have moved some distance away from it. Salutary now serves to describe something as broadly beneficial or helpful in fostering some positive good, as in salutary experience or a salutary effect on the discussion. \n Salutatory has strong links with salutation (“greeting”: which is ultimately a good health wish). So salutatory means “offering a welcome,” as in a salutatory letter from the new landlord."

(See further under coherence or cohesion.) \n When same is used as an adjective in clausal comparisons, the following conjunction may be either as or that: \n . . . at the same time as I was compiling the paper \n . . . at the same time that I was compiling the paper \n Researchers associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) found that at the same time as and in the same way as were both among the most commonly occurring “five-word bundles” in their corpus of conversation. This probably gives them a collocational advantage over constructions with that, though their high frequency is helped by the fact that as can be complemented by noun phrases as well as finite clauses. But clausal comparisons not involving the words time or way are more often construed with that than as, by the evidence of the BNC. Examples such as the following are only tokens of the range in which writers prefer to use that following same: \n . . . subject to the same legislation that governs other foodstuffs \n . . . for the same reason that I did \n The choice of that after same does not seem to correlate with more or less formal style."

		"title": "sanatorium, sanitarium and sanitorium",
		"explanation":"Sanatorium is the standard British spelling for a hospital or residential centre for the chronically ill, and it dominates in data from the BNC. It serves whether the facility is run along medical lines, as in TB sanatorium, or something closer to a health resort, as in take a cure at the local sanatorium. In American English sanitarium is the common spelling for both, by the evidence of CCAE, although sanatorium (and to a lesser extent sanitorium) are also current. Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes a slight tendency to prefer sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, and sanitarium for mental and emotional disorders, perhaps because it lines up with the word sanity. These somewhat unsettled boundaries create doubts about the spelling, and Webster’s Third (1986) records a fourth one: sanatarium, though there’s no sign of it in CCAE. \n Sanatorium and sanitarium are about equally used in Canada for the hospital and the health resort, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). Neither is much used by Australians, though the analogy with better-known words such as sanitary, sanitize, sanitation inclines them towards sanitarium (Peters, 1995), as well as the trademark Sanitarium attached to health foods. \n ♦ For the plurals of sanatorium and sanitarium, see under -um."

Yet the horrific implications of the word are somehow muted in its latinity. If its shocking implications are to be communicated, “bloody” or “bloodthirsty” says it more clearly and strongly. \n Sanguine came under the influence of medieval ideas about the four bodily humors which affected a person’s temperament: blood, phlegm, yellow bile (choler) and black bile (melancholy). Those in whom “blood” was dominant had a cheerful, energetic character, and so sanguine now means “confident” and “optimistic.”"

Some style commentators suggest that satiated connotes excess more often than sated, though neither is free of pejorative connotations. If a neutral word is needed, a paraphrase with satisfy (e.g. satisfy the need for) would serve. \n Saturated in ordinary parlance means “soaked with a liquid, as much as the medium can absorb”: \n The carpets were still saturated after the flood. \n In military jargon it conveys the idea of an area attacked with so many bombs or fighter aircraft as to render it defenseless."

The spelling with two ns appeared first in C16, and the variant with h in C17. The unetymological h suggests that it was thought of as an Indian word, and the spelling savannah prevails through the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) citations from C19. This explains why it was given preference as headword, and it’s still the more frequent of the two in British English, by a factor of about 3:1 in data from the BNC. But in American English savanna is given preference by Merriam-Webster (2000), and it’s the commoner spelling in CCAE by about 10:1 – despite the fact that spellings with h are enshrined in placenames such as Savannah River and the town of Savannah in Georgia."

Savoir vivre is “knowing how to live.” It usually involves experience of good living, and so is more likely to be accessed by those with the means or good fortune to partake of the good life. Yet savoir vivre suggests more refined taste than is associated with la dolce vita: see under dolce vita. \n Savoir faire is much better established in English, in spite of being the more recently adopted (first recorded in C19, whereas savoir vivre goes back to C18).

British writers clearly prefer sawn in both compound verbs (have/be sawn) and adjectival uses (sawn timbers) by the evidence of the BNC, whereas Americans go the other way, maintaining the regular form for the past participle most of the time, in data from CCAE."

In ordinary usage, large-scale means “extensive,” and small-scale, “small in size,” as in a large-scale/small-scale operation. In references to maps etc., the small-scale version covers more ground but offers less detail. The large-scale version, by contrast, gives you the fine detail of a relatively small area. It would help walkers but not drivers. So a large-scale map might be 1:2000 and the small-scale map 1:200 000, though the differences are always relative. \n Note that when scale(s) means a weighing instrument, usage makes it singular in North America (stand on the scale) and plural in Britain and Australia (stand on the scales). The singular scale seems to refer to the whole instrument, while the plural scales conjures up the twin pans of the balance. Either way the word is Germanic in origin and related historically to the word shell. But the scale of maps is quite unrelated, and goes back to the Latin word scala meaning “ladder.”"

Just where the word came from is unclear, though Barnhart (1987) proposes two alternatives based on Scottish origins. In C19, it referred both to an undersized animal, and to a reprobate or scoundrel, the latter sense being reinforced after the US Civil War, when it was applied to white southerners who collaborated with reconstruction governments for private gain. It remains more derogatory in the US than the UK, where its use is often affectionate: the old scallywag."

Yet the use of the comparative than is quite common, and may indeed sound more idiomatic to some ears. The arguments for it are like those for hardly than.

It was then reborrowed in C19 in its classical form, as a technical term for English philosophers of C19 and for psychologists in early C20, referring to a principle of understanding or the cognitive model by which we interpret elements of experience. Schema broke out into general usage in mid-C20, as a term for an overview (in the form of a plan, outline or diagram). But in discourse analysis since the 1970s, its use is closer to that of psychologists, as a term for the underlying structure of a piece of prose. The tug-of-war between general and specialized uses helps to explain why both Greek and English plurals are current, in evidence from American and British databases. The Greek schemata is mostly found in academic writing (e.g. experiential schemata), whereas the anglicized schemas is used freely in both technical and more general discourse: database access schemas, theories that memory is based on schemas.

In fact it can correspond to any of the five vowel letters, as italicized in the following: about watches politics photograph natural Being an unstressed vowel, schwa is highly variable in its sound – hence its alternative name “indeterminate vowel.” Its indeterminacy means it offers no clues as to the spelling of the syllable it appears in, and many spelling dilemmas, as with -able/-ible, -ant/-ent and -er/-or, exist because of it."

		"title": "scientific names",
		"explanation":"Biological classifications have more levels than we’re normally aware of. Both botanists and zoologists work with six levels, as shown below: \n botany: Division, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.  zoology:  Phylum, Class, Order,  Family, Genus, Species. \n For ordinary purposes, only the last two levels are used. Most biological names consist of two parts, both of them Latin words, which specify the genus and the species: \n Azalea indica Azalea kurume, Python ater Python reticulatus \n Occasionally a third word is used to identify a botanic subspecies, typically a cultivar, as in Azalea indica var. balsaminaeflora. The words designating the species and subspecies may be descriptive, as in the examples above, or may preserve in latinized form the name of the person who identified the species, for example: Azalea rutherfordiana. \n Biological names are always italicized, but only the first is capitalized, even if others are disguised proper names. Additional proper names are printed in roman after the Latin elements. For cultivated species they appear in a combination of parentheses and quote marks – Azalea kurume “Yaya-hiryu” (Scarlet Prince) – when a foreign name or phrase needs translating. \n In current zoological nomenclature, the name of the “author” (i.e. identifier of the species) is given in roman after the Latin names – at least once in an article, according to the CBE Manual (1994). The name and date are put in parentheses if the classification has changed. The Australian duck-billed platypus was first classified by Shaw as Platypus anatinus, until it emerged that the existing Platypus genus was used for beetles. A new genus name was found, and it is now ornithorhincus anatinus (Shaw, 1799). \n Other conventions with scientific names are that when several species of the same genus are mentioned in quick succession, the genus can be abbreviated to an initial (Azalea indica, A. kurume, A. rutherfordiana) for the second and subsequent names. Note also that when the Latin word for genus or species is used as the common name for a plant or animal, it’s printed with lower case and in roman: \n They found azaleas and rhododendrons flowering everywhere. \n The naming principles described above apply throughout the natural world, as well as in medicine. They are used in the naming of body organs, e.g. Corpus callosum (the band of tissue which links the two hemispheres of the brain); and in the names of diseases – Paralysis agitans (= Parkinson’s disease) – and micro-organisms: Legionella pneumophilia (the microbe which causes the most familiar form of legionnaire’s disease).

		"title": "Scotch, Scots or Scottish",
		"explanation":"Conventional uses of Scotch, as in Scotch whisky, mask the reasons for its replacement by Scots and Scottish as ways of referring to the people and things associated with Scotland. Scotch was traditionally used by the Scots in referring to themselves, and is enshrined in the writings of Burns and Scott. Yet from mid-C19 on, the English seem to have avoided using Scotch, on grounds of the “Scotsman’s supposed dislike of it” (Oxford Dictionary, 1989), making it an early example of (mistaken) political correctness. The retitling of Mendelssohn’s “Scotch Symphony” – dedicated to Queen Victoria in 1842 – as his Scottish Symphony is symptomatic of the changeover. Perhaps the avoidance of Scotch by the English had more to do with the colloquial adjective scotch (in lower case) meaning “parsimonious,” which was first documented in early C20, but may well have been in use before then. Its negative connotations are no problem for traditional collocations such as Scotch fir/pine, Scotch mist, Scotch salmon, Scotch thistle; and Scotch whisky is its own trademark. Scotch Tape (“adhesive tape”) likewise continues as a trademark in North America. But other products were rechristened, so that Scotch plaid/tartan is now Scottish plaid/tartan, and you wouldn’t expect Scottish beef or Scottish beer to be otherwise. People’s Scotch-Irish ancestry now tends to be spoken of as Scots-Irish. \n Broadly speaking, Scots is nowadays used in reference to the people, as in Scotsman and the Scots Guards, while Scottish is applied to aspects of the land and its culture, as in Scottish agriculture and Scottish universities. In some contexts either word is acceptable, as in a Scots/Scottish accent. The relative frequencies of Scots and Scottish in British and American databases suggest that Americans are less inclined to use Scots as a general adjective and prefer Scottish for that role, whereas the British use both as adjectives. In both the UK and the US, Scots serves as a collective noun for the people. \n Databases show that the lower case form scotch is often used for “whisky,” in British and especially American English: a little drop of scotch. The lower case form also serves for the quite unrelated verb scotch (“quash”), as in the first argument to scotch – where whisky is not the secret weapon. Its origins are lost in the mists of C15 English."

In current American English, sculpted is a good deal more frequent than sculptured, by about 5:2 in CCAE data; and sculpted has the edge (8:7) in citations from the BNC. Yet when both occur in the same sentence, some kind of contrast may be intended, as if sculpturing involves three-dimensional carving and sculpting mostly two dimensions: \n a white marble building surmounted by a series of large sculptured figures with extensive use of decorative sculpted friezes \n Dictionaries lend no support to that distinction, and both verbs are freely applied to two- and three-dimensional work, in database evidence from the US and the UK."

Note that as a prefix self- is always hyphenated, but as a suffix, never. As a suffix -self/-selves is the key ingredient in English reflexive pronouns (see under that heading). \n As an independent word, self can be a noun, modified by its own adjective as in your good self and his usual self. Yet when used on its own and as a substitute for myself, as in a trip for my wife and self, it sounds a bit offhanded.

		"explanation":"Derived from scholarly Latin words, the prefix semi- means “half ” or “partly.” In musical words such as semibreve and semiquaver it means exactly half of a larger unit; whereas the less precise meaning (“partly”) is found in semiconscious and semisweet. \n In spite of its Latin origins, semi- is now very much at home in English. It combines with everyday English words, as in: \n semi(-)desert semi(-)final semi(-)intellectual \n semi(-)official semi(-)skilled semi(-)soft \n semi(-)trailer \n Words prefixed with semi- are usually written with hyphens in British English, as indicated in New Oxford (1998). In American English they are equally likely to appear without them, according to Merriam-Webster (2000). The dictionaries make no distinction according to whether the word combined with semi- begins with a vowel or not (see further under hyphens section 1). \n Semi also has an independent existence, or rather several. North Americans and Australians use it in speech and everyday writing to refer to semitrailers. In Britain, Canada and Australia, semi is also used for a semi-detached house. In competitive sport the world over, semi refers to the semifinal. The plural is semis for all. \n ♦ Compare demi-."

		"title": "semicolon",
		"explanation":"When the average written sentence was much longer, semicolons were used much more often as sentence dividers. They are very visible in the narrative of C19 novels such as those by Anthony Trollope and Henry James. Nowadays the semicolon is used sparingly, and some writers do without it entirely. Its place in marking items in vertical lists is being superseded by other punctuative devices (see lists section 2), and it has a limited role in digital documents (see digital style). But semicolons still have two very specific functions. \n 1 The semicolon marks the boundary between two independent sentences that are set together as one, usually because the second is strongly related to the first. For example: \n The minister mentioned a possible cut in interest rates; immediately there was a run on the stock exchange. \n In cases like that, the two sections could equally well have been set as separate sentences, with a full stop between them: \n The minister mentioned a possible cut in interest rates. Immediately there was a run on the stock exchange. \n However the version with the semicolon emphasizes the closeness of the two statements, and draws particular attention to the second. Note that the two could also be linked with a comma and a conjunction: \n The minister mentioned a possible cut in interest rates, and immediately there was a run on the stock exchange. \n 2 Semicolons serve as a second level of punctuation, in a series of words or phrases which already have commas to make internal divisions. See for example: \n The minister’s announcement resulted in an instant drop in the value of shares; a modest fall in bank rates, at least those offered by the larger ones; and a surprising run on property investments, presumably backed by overseas capital. \n In complex horizontal lists such as that, the demarcation of the three subunits would be less clear if commas alone were used. Here again, the greater “weight” of the semicolon is put to good use."

		"title": "seniors and senior citizens",
		"explanation":"In Latin senior means “older” rather than “old,” and is relative rather than absolute in sense. This relativity carries over into English, where seniors can be applied to persons aged 12 plus, around 18, or 21, or over 65, according to context. At the youthful end of the age spectrum, seniors is sometimes used in the UK of students above primary school level (typically 12 years or more), whereas in the US it refers to those either in the high school graduation year (around 18), or else in the final year of college (around 21). None could be called senior citizens – the respectful title reserved for those at the grey end of the age spectrum. The phrase originated in American English just before World War II, and has been used in British English since the 1960s. If it began as a euphemism for those over 65 and out of the workforce, the feeling has disappeared in North America, according to Webster’s English Usage (1989) and Canadian English Usage (1997). In Australia it is institutionalized: there and elsewhere it’s cheerfully shortened to seniors (as in seniors card, seniors day), which seems to keep the respect without being cumbersome. It thus seems to avoid the problems associated with other kinds of inclusive language (see further under political correctness).

Nowadays we’re unlikely to use sensibility in that way, and would reserve it for responsiveness to the subtleties of experience and of artistic form. The adjective sensible has also shifted, from being associated with sensibility in its older sense, to being the standard adjective for sense. \n Both sensitivity and sensitiveness link up with the adjective sensitive, and express the readiness to respond to outside forces. Though both words originated in C19, only sensitivity is in common use, outnumbering the other by almost 200:1 in British material from the BNC, and an even larger ratio in American data from CCAE. Stylistically the two are interchangeable, except that in technical fields sensitivity is the standard term for the response of a machine or organism to physical and chemical forces, as in: \n . . . the sensitivity and accuracy of its power-assisted steering \n . . . sensitivity of the pancreas to raised blood glucose \n Compare: \n . . . a thoroughly English writer’s \n sensitiveness/sensitivity to the vagaries of the weather \n where either word could be used."

		"title": "sensuous or sensual",
		"explanation":"Both these words mean that the senses are engaged: the question is which senses. Since Puritan times it has been argued that sensual implies the gratifying of physical senses including sexual ones, which will probably help to sell a book with the title Sensual Massage. Sensuous has therefore been reserved by some for that which appeals to the aesthetic senses, as when we refer to a song’s sensuous duet with the flute. The word sensuous seems to have been coined by Milton for just this purpose, to prevent confusion with sensual. \n Yet the distinction is not so easily applied to what we enjoy eating and drinking, or elsewhere. Should chocolate – or wine – be described as sensual because it is a physical pleasure, or sensuous to show that it’s not a sexual pleasure? The Random House Dictionary (1987) suggests that at bottom sensual has pejorative connotations which sensuous is free of. But sensual keeps positive company in American and British English, in examples from CCAE and the BNC: \n the sensual qualities of light \n a sauce so simply sensual \n an enticingly sensual opening to this outstanding recital \n the furniture’s edges, making it more curved, more sensual \n Thus sensual can be used to express sensory satisfaction in a variety of contexts that are both physical and aesthetic. Webster’s English Usage (1989) concludes that the traditional distinction between sensual and sensuous is honored as much in the breach as the observance. New Oxford ’s conclusion is similar, that the two are “frequently used interchangeably,” and this interchangeability is noted also in Canadian English Usage (1997). The interplay between the two words makes sensuous less aesthetic and innocent than Milton intended, in commonplaces such as sensuous lips and a sensuous mouth. The author who writes of innocently sensuous lips reflects the problem – clarifying the meaning for some readers, while creating a tautology for those who read it along Miltonian lines. \n The sensuous/sensual distinction is blurred for many writers and readers, and artificial because of the complexity of our senses. With two words working much the same semantic territory, one is likely to lose out, and in terms of overall frequency it would be sensuous. Already it’s outnumbered by sensual in both the BNC and CCAE in the ratio of 3:2, and also in Australian data from ACE. In the process, sensual loses its more negative implications of sexual excess, and, if they are to be communicated, another adjective or paraphrase has to be found. \n Worlds apart is the use of sensual in philosophy, where it’s neutral in meaning and associated with sensationalism (the doctrine that all knowledge is ultimately derived from sensation)."

		"title": "sentences",
		"explanation":"The finite strings of words by which we communicate are sentences. A written sentence is bounded by a capital letter on its first word, and a full stop after the last. Spoken sentences are much more variable in length, marked off by intonation patterns and pauses, though interrupted by internal pauses as well. The two kinds of sentence can be analyzed in terms of (a) the particular function that they fulfill; and (b) the common structures they present in strings of words. Both contribute to writing style. \n 1 The functions of sentences are usually classified as: \n a) making statements \n b) asking questions \n c) uttering commands \n d) voicing exclamations \n Each of those functions is expressed through a standard clause type: (a) declarative (b) interrogative (c) imperative (d) exclamative. Yet there’s no one-for-one correspondence between clause type and sentence function. (For examples, see under commands.) \n 2 The internal structure of a sentence can be analyzed in terms of clause structure: is there one or more of them, and what is the interrelationship between them? The distinctions between simple, complex and compound sentences turn on this (see under clauses) \n Our expectations of sentences tend to be modeled on the norms of written syntax, where clauses normally have the full subject and predicate, and any subordinate clause has a main clause to support it. Yet many of the utterances in a conversation are not quite like that. Much is understood and left implicit, as in: \n Where are you going? \n To see a movie. \n In the city? \n No, just the local cinema. Don’t have to go further afield. \n Apart from the first question, all the “sentences” in that ordinary piece of dialogue are fragmentary – and would be classed as sentence fragments in traditional grammar. The three in the middle have neither subject nor verb, and consist simply of adverbial phrases. The last is more fully expressed, but still lacks a subject. In terms of scripted dialogue they still count as sentences, though they differ from those of nonfictional prose. \n 3 Sentences and style. Whether in fiction or nonfiction, sentences are the staple of discourse, and their patterning creates the rhythm of prose. (See under rhythm.) Variety in length and structure are both important for their effect on intelligibility as well as rhythm. Too many long complex sentences will lose the rhythm and the reader. Too many short ones in quick succession create an awkward, repetitive rhythm which distracts the reader from what’s being said. Ideally the occasional short sentence provides relief from longer ones. In Plain English documents, writers aim to average 20 words per sentence (see under Plain English). However the average achieved in popular fiction is around 15 words, and this is the target for mass circulation magazines. \n Apart from varying in length, sentences need variety in their openings, using topicalizing phrases now and then before the grammatical subject, and avoiding anticlimaxes at the end. The sentence is after all an infinitely flexible unit, to be rearranged and stretched and compressed in the interests of an elegant style."

		"title": "sentiment, sentimental and sentimentality",
		"explanation":"Sentiment has many shades of meaning in reference to thoughts, attitudes and feelings. Its connotations are neutral, and it relies on modifiers to give it particulars and values, as in a cheerful sentiment and a negative sentiment. Sentimentality is somewhat pejorative. It implies an excess of emotion where most people would not indulge it: \n Their attitude to endangered species showed more sentimentality than scientific sense. \n Sentimental serves as adjective for both sentiment and sentimentality – for the first in sentimental value, and for the second in sentimental admiration for times past. However the fact that sentimental can be linked with sentimentality tends to give it a pejorative flavor generally, and so it’s better avoided if you wish to make a link with sentiment. Calling someone a sentimental person is unlikely to sound like a compliment, as person of sentiment once did."

		"title": "separate and separate out",
		"explanation":"The verb separate (“divide, set apart”) has long been used with an object, as in: \n Two factors separate the German bourgeoisie from its counterparts in Western and Asian nations. \n This simple transitive use is now paralleled by a phrasal form separate out, as in: \n Older people prefer not to be separated out from the adult population. \n The second construction is criticized by some as tautologous – which it would be, if “divide” was the sense intended. But separate out otherwise carries the sense of distilling something from a matrix, which could apply to that example, just as it does in: \n Households are required to separate out recyclable waste. \n This use of separate out seems to reflect its C19 origins in physical chemistry, as when a chemical substance is drawn out as crystals from a solution: \n The silicon will make the aluminium separate out harmlessly. \n Intransitive examples like that pose no grammatical challenge, though passive (i.e. transitive) ones also appear from the start. They emerge also in statistical procedures and social science analyses, as in: the low-income group were separated out from the rest for averaging purposes. The first nontechnical examples were recorded in the US in 1962, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and have since appeared elsewhere. A hundred-odd examples of separate(d) out in BNC data show it to be well established now in British English. It can even be used for fun, as in: \n I tried to separate out the harmonics in the snoring. \n Despite this, the transitive use of separate out is not acknowledged in New Oxford (1998).

		"title": "sequence of tenses and backshifting",
		"explanation":"The principle of a sequence of tenses originated in Latin grammar, and is sometimes applied in English to the reporting of speech (see further under direct speech). By this principle, the tense of the reporting verb in the main clause will influence that of the verb in a subordinate clause. Compare \n He says they’re coming at noon. \n He said they were coming at noon. \n In the second sentence, the past verb of the main clause prompts backshifting of the tense in the second clause, so that they form a matching sequence. This backshift occurs in noun (content) clauses following verbs of speaking as well as verbs of mental process, such as decide, expect, know. For narrators, backshifted tenses help to coordinate the construction of past events within the “present” shared by writer and reader. \n Backshifting also affects sentences that express conditions (see the Comprehensive Grammar, 1985). Compare: \n If he has any money, he will surely invest it. \n If he had any money, he would surely invest it. \n If he had had any money, he would have invested it. \n In each case the verb in the subordinate clause is one “tense” back from that of the main clause. Expressed in traditional grammar terms, the sequences are present v. future, past v. present (conditional), past perfect v. present perfect (conditional). The third sentence shows how backshifting into the past perfect creates a remote or impossible condition, instead of an open one (see further under conditional). \n Though the sequencing/matching of tenses occurs often enough in certain kinds of subordinate clause, the convention is varied from time to time because of the nature of the material in the clause. If it contains a statement which is believed to be universally true, it can be expressed in the present tense even when the verb of the main clause is past: \n They recognized that all life is sacred. \n The present is also used when the writer stands between a reported event in the past and one anticipated in the future: \n James told us that Monday is a public holiday. \n In both cases, the use of the present tense serves to involve readers in the statement and to lend it vividness, as Fowler (1926) put it. It would also be possible to put the subordinate clauses into the past and observe the regular sequence of tenses in them. But this seems to reduce the salience of the statement for the present. The sequence of tenses is thus a discoursal resource rather than a grammatical imperative for writers of English."

It is then curious that Serbian is more than twice as frequent as Serb in British sources captured in the BNC, where the opposite holds for American English material in CCAE. The difference may have less to do with regional preferences than the fact that the American data comes largely from newspapers, where American military action is being reported. Research by Kjellmer (2000) on data from CNN showed that Serb most typically went with nouns such as forces, soldiers, target, units, and Serbian with government, media, orthodox church, television/TV.

On screen, sans serif letters give a “cleaner” look because of the lower resolution of the digital medium. They are sometimes used for the text in computer manuals and other technical publications. Sans serif fonts are widely used to contrast with serif in headlines and headings. Whether they will supersede serif fonts as the common medium for the body text – just as roman fonts superseded italic ones – remains to be seen. \n The word serif is occasionally respelled as seriph, either through confusion with the Hebrew word seraph, or just through substituting ph for f in a “foreign” word (see f/ph).

Ongoing financial management is the focus of a serviced debt/loan/investment. In agriculture, service is the standard term for the mating of a male animal with females, as in a small herd serviced by a pedigree bull. But if applied to human activity, the implications are obscene, as in the following example from the BNC: \n a lady called “Toss-Off Kate,” who used to go round the audience and sit beside various isolated gentlemen and ask them if they wanted to be serviced. \n This risky side of service can be raised unintentionally when the agent of the passive verb is identifiably female, as in the hostel is serviced by a night nurse. An abstract or inanimate agent helps to avert the problem, as in: \n The hostel is serviced after hours through an external nursing agency. \n There and elsewhere with the verb service, a nonhuman agent keeps the red light off."

Sewn is now the dominant form in both British and American English, though some Americans make use of sewed as the past participle. In data from CCAE, sewed is occasionally used in references to domestic or surgical stitching, and especially in the idiom sew up: \n O’Neill has the Republican nomination sewed up. \n British writers represented in the BNC overwhelmingly prefer sewn up for this idiom, and only rarely use sewed as past participle for the plying of thread. \n ♦ For other hybrid verbs with both regular and irregular forms, see irregular verbs section 9."

By those definitions, it’s taulogous to speak of a sewerage system, and raw sewerage is inexact. Yet as those examples show, sewerage sometimes appears instead of sewage, perhaps as a euphemism, or because its derivation is more transparent. The Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) citations show sewerage being used instead of sewage from the beginning, and its definitions allow for it. New Oxford (1998) labels this “US,” although there’s a low level of use among British writers – in about 5% of BNC examples – exactly the same rate as in data from CCAE.

		"title": "shall or will",
		"explanation":"Traditional grammar made these complementary forms of the English future tense (see below, section 1). Yet they are not grammatical analogues of the past tense inflections, nor are they the only means of expressing futurity. Periphrastic auxiliary constructions provide a variety of others, such as: \n am about to (leave) am going to (leave) am to (leave) \n In conversational English, contracted forms of the verb phrase are commonly used to project events into the future: \n I’ll leave I’m going to leave I’m leaving \n Future events can also be expressed in the simple present tense (see under present tense and future tense). All these constructions, including shall and will, provide particular angles on what may come and the speaker/writer’s orientation to it – like facets of the proverbial crystal ball. The relationship between shall, will and other modal verbs is discussed under modality. \n 1 Not simply the future. Grammarians have known for centuries that shall and will could express more than predictions of the future, and might indeed express volition or the determination that something should happen. Historically this meaning is associated with will, but in current English it’s mostly associated with shall, as in legal statements to the effect that: \n The Directors shall file a report on the company’s financial posittion twice a year. \n Yet the distinction between intention and futurity can be hazy, and grammarians of C17 and C18 devised an odd compromise whereby both shall and will could express one or the other, depending on the grammatical person involved. Their system was as follows: \n (express future) \n I/we shall you shall and he/she/it/they will \n (express intention) \n I/we will you will and he/she/it/they shall \n Research by Fries (1925) into the language of English drama from C17 on showed that this division of labor was artificial even in its own time. The paradigms were however enshrined in textbooks of later centuries and still taught a few decades ago. Their neglect is one of the better consequences of abandoning the teaching of grammar in schools. The reappraisal of shall/will as modal verbs has provided fresh insight into their roles (see modality). \n 2 Shall and will in statements. Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) confirms that will occurs far more often than shall in all registers and modes (spoken and written). Will is “extremely common,” where shall is relatively rare. When it occurs, shall more often expresses volition than a prediction of the future. The frequency of will is also boosted by use of the contraction ’ll (as in we’ll) which occurs so often in conversation. On phonetic grounds ’ll is unlikely to be a reduced form of shall, because the “sh” sound is less likely to merge with surrounding vowels than “w.” The decline of shall is more marked in the US and elsewhere than in the UK, as shown by Hundt’s (1998) studies of comparable corpora of American, British, Australian and New Zealand English. In what follows we focus on the continuing British uses of shall, of which there are just residues in other Englishes. \n The first question is whether British users of shall do prefer it for first person statements of the future. The principle is not backed up by BNC data, where instances of will with I/we outnumber shall in the ratio of 3:2, and the much larger ratio of 5:1 when contractions with ’ll are factored in. Instead the data on will/’ll confirm that shall (with the first person) is associated with written rather than spoken style, and has become stylistically marked if not somewhat formal (Siemund, 1993). With second and third person pronouns, the preference for will is even stronger, and BNC data finds it in more than 97% of cases. The figure goes down a few percent (to around 92%), if you include third person subjects other than pronouns – those associated with legal or regulatory statements, illustrated above (section 1). But if you add in cases of will contracted to ’ll with third person pronouns, the overall percentage climbs back up. Spoken usage in the UK (as everywhere else) is edging shall out. \n 3 Shall and will in questions. In questions which seek information about the future, shall is much more often found with first person pronouns than with second or third. These are the one context in which the old rules for shall and will (section 1 above) do seem to apply. In data from the BNC, more than 95% of questions using shall were in the first person (I/we). That is not to say that will never appears in first person questions: in fact they make up about 15% of all interrogative uses of will. But will dominates in second and third person questions. Of those phrased with you or he/she/it/they, more than 97% used will. These strong tendencies apply, whether the questions asked seek information or advice, offer instructions or pose a request: \n Shall I bring my lunch? Shall we begin? \n Will you put it over there please? \n What will it contain? Will he like me, Lily? \n The use of shall in first person questions, i.e. “polite” questions which allow others to take the affirmative, is further evidence of its stylistic marking in current British English. \n International English selection: Will is now the standard choice for expressing future plans and expectations, everywhere in the world. Shall is stylistically marked with volitional meaning in legal and regulatory statements, and expresses politeness in first person questions."

However sharp appears here and there, in idioms expressing direction, time, and musical pitch: \n You must turn sharp left at the traffic lights. \n He arrived at 8 pm sharp. \n The violin was tuned a little sharp. \n In sentences like those, sharp is a zero adverb, and the only possible choice whether they are spoken or written. See further under zero adverbs."

		"title": "she",
		"explanation":"This pronoun has gender built irrevocably into it, which is uncontroversial when you are referring to a female being (see gender section 2, on natural gender). Other uses of the pronoun she are not grounded in nature, but matters of convention. Sailors referring to their ships conventionally use she, and pronoun references to the names of countries are sometimes female, as in Britain and her allies, especially in rhetorical style. However in plainer contexts of communication this use of she/her is being steadily replaced by it/its. \n Yet another use of she is neither natural nor conventional but an instrument of affirmative action. This is when writers substitute she/her for he/him/his when referring to an individual of unspecified gender, so as to redress the prevailing imbalance in the use of male and female pronouns for generic purposes. For example: \n Before calling the electrician, make sure you can show her where the fuses are. \n Such attempts to create a generic she are distracting when attached to roles not traditionally performed by women, since they violate both cultural norms and linguistic convention. Nor does it help to use male and female pronouns in alternation, as some have suggested, so as to be “evenhanded” and help break down the gender stereotypes: \n The doctor must ensure that his paging device is turned on before she goes into the ward, and be prepared to respond within one minute to calls made to him by hospital staff. In the operating theatre, she should hand his device over to one of the nurses assisting . . . \n However systematic the alternation of pronouns, the resulting text is incoherent because we rely on consistent sets of pronouns to provide cohesion in a text. (See further under coherence or cohesion.) Gender-free continuity cannot be achieved with either she or he, but there are other ways round the problem. See next entry, and he and/or she."

		"title": "s/he",
		"explanation":"This combination pronoun recommends itself as a solution to the problem of how to refer quickly and comprehensively to both sexes. Like the less integrated she/he, it foregrounds the feminine pronoun rather than the masculine – and may therefore be a tad too affirmative for some. In fact it was first proposed in the 1970s (Baron, 1986); and Merriam-Webster (2000), Canadian Oxford (1998) and New Oxford (1998) all recognize it. In BNC data there are over 100 examples of s/he in various types of nonfiction and institutional prose, and it’s more than twice as common as she/he. \n S/he is effective when the pronoun is the subject, though there’s no integrated form for object and possessive pronouns – only her/him or her/his. A natural solution is to use them/their which neutralizes the gender issue (see they, them, their). \n ♦ For other solutions to the pronoun problem, see he and/or she."

		"title": "she-",
		"explanation":"She- has sometimes served as a simple gender prefix as in she-goat and she-holly. But in most words formed with it, the gender reference carries derogatory implications of one kind or another, as in she-devil and she-poetry. In the colonial era, various Australian trees were named with she-, including she-beech, she-oak, she-pine, where the name implied that the timber was “inferior . . . in respect of texture, colour or other character,” according to Morris (1898). The ad hoc names disappeared with the era of heavy logging, to be replaced by latinate ones, e.g she-oak by casuarina. The disuse of she- in its prejudicial sense would seem to be a small victory for nonsexism in language – well before the movement dubbed political correctness (see further under that heading)."

		"title": "sheafs or sheaves",
		"explanation":"The older plural sheaves still prevails in American and British English for most uses of the word sheaf – whether as the stand of corn in older harvesting methods, or a bundle of cut rice, tobacco leaves or flowers. Only in reference to paper does sheafs gain a slice of the action, as in sheafs of documents / paper orders / proposed legislation. When sheaves is used, there is perhaps a hint of the old-fashioned or out-dated, as in sheaves of yellowed printout, but the plural itself often suggests a paper system grown (almost) out of control. See further under -f/-v-."

	{
		"title": "sheared, shore and shorn",
		"explanation":"This Old English verb has been slowly replacing its irregular past forms shore (past tense) and shorn (past participle) with the regular sheared. As often, the past tense was regularized first, and during C20 sheared became the standard form for cutting things off with shears, whether wool off the sheep’s back or growth from the hedge: shore is now rather archaic. Sheared is also used intransitively to refer to metal objects breaking off under external forces, as in the cable sheared, or it sheared the wheel off the wagon. \n As past participle, sheared still shares the field with shorn, in British and American English. In compound verbs, sheared is more likely than shorn (by a 2:1 ratio in the BNC as well as CCAE); but shorn comes into its own in metaphorical uses, especially coupled with of, as in an economic system shorn of justice. Shorn is also more commonly found as the ordinary attributive adjective, as in shorn hair, shorn lamb, shorn cornfield. Only in references to grades of fur, e.g. sheared beaver, is sheared the regular form of the adjective."

		"title": "shed or shedded",
		"explanation":"Written into shed, there are two verbs. The older one meaning “drop” or “leave behind” goes back to Old English, and has both physical and figurative uses. Compare trees shedding their leaves with shedding all caution. It has exactly the same form (shed) for past and present (see further under irregular verbs section 1). The second verb dating back to C15 means just “put [a vehicle] into a shed.” Its past form, usually past participle, is shedded, as in Trams were temporarily shedded at the old depot."

		"title": "sheikh, sheik, shaikh or shaykh",
		"explanation":"The spelling sheikh is prioritized in New Oxford (1998), and used more frequently than any of the others by writers in the BNC. Yet closer inspection of the British data shows that sheikh, shaikh and shaykh are most commonly found in titles, such as Sheikh Mohammed, Shaikh Abdel-Karim Obeid, while generic uses of the word are quite often sheik, as in an Arab sheik or a well-oiled sheik. The revival of shaikh and shaykh in the 1990s reflects the revisionary process at work in various Arabic loanwords, bringing it closer to the Arabic source sayk (“old man”). Americans meanwhile continue to prefer sheik/Sheik in both generic and titular uses of the word, by the evidence of CCAE. This is in line with Webster’s Third (1986) rather than Merriam-Webster (2000). \n The choice between sheikh and sheik impacts also on the noun sheik(h)dom. So American data from CCAE shows a strong preference for sheikdom, whereas British usage seems mixed, amid very small samples of sheik(h)dom(s) in the BNC. The preference of New Oxford and Merriam-Webster for sheikhdom seems to reflect their position on sheikh, rather than the facts of usage."

		"title": "sherbet or sherbert",
		"explanation":"The standard spelling for this sugary food is sherbet, reflecting its origins in Turkish serbet and relations with the French word sorbet. The variant sherbert is registered in Merriam-Webster (2000) and supported by data from CCAE, where it appears as an alternative to sherbet in about 12% of instances. According to Webster’s English Usage (1989), its currency in the US may have been helped by its use for an ice confection – and in Australia by its slang application to beer: pumped up by a few sherberts. Webster’s English Usage reports that its most recent evidence is “heavily British,” and sherbert makes two small appearances in the BNC, though there are ten times as many of sherbet. In so far as sherbert represents a longish second vowel which has no “r” coloring, it’s more likely to turn up in southern British and Australian pronunciation. However both Webster’s Third (1986) and Merriam-Webster (2000) indicate an alternative American pronunciation with “r” in both syllables, matching the use of sherbert as an alternative spelling."

		"title": "sheriff, sherif and sharif",
		"explanation":"A single letter makes the difference between Anglo-Saxon and American sheriff (a law-enforcement officer) and the Arab sherif (a Muslim ruler or descendant of Muhammad). But their origins set them far apart: sheriff was once a compound (“shire reeve”), while sherif is related to the Arabic sarif (“noble”). The Arabic source word also explains the trend to replace sherif with sharif, the standard form in recent dictionaries such as New Oxford (1998), Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998). Sharif is superseding both sherif and shereef, another older spelling which underscored the long vowel of the second syllable."

	},
	{
		"title": "shibboleth",
		"explanation":"Ancient and modern uses of this word combine to make it an apt label for linguistic fetishes of C21. The original shibboleth was a pronunciation testword used to distinguish those who could pronounce the initial “sh” sound, from others who would make it “s.” According to the biblical story (Judges 12:4–6) Jephthah used the word shibboleth to distinguish his own Gileadite men from Ephraimites fleeing in disguise. In modern English the word shibboleth has been extended to the catchcry of a distinct party or sect, or a slogan whose impetus is emotional rather than rational and represents outdated sentiments. The party shibboleths still serve to identify members and to exclude those who don’t belong. \n Many controversial points of English seem to be shibboleths for members of a notional party for the protection of pure English. The insistence on different from, the avoidance of split infinitives, and the preservation of the subjunctive are planks in the party platform, endorsed without any critical thought about their basis in contemporary English. More damagingly, they are made the touchstones of “correct” English, to which everyone must adhere or be damned. \n This book tries to address issues like those which have tended to become shibboleths, to open them up to linguistic analysis, and to query their use by some as all-powerful criteria for judgements about writing. See also fetish."

		"title": "shine",
		"explanation":"The verb shine has traditionally been irregular with shone as both past tense and past participle, and shone is still standard when referring to light or other kinds of luminescence: \n Through the glass shone God’s sun.  \n . . . shone the torch around the shed \n His humanity had always shone through. \n Other data from the BNC show that British writers occasionally use shone for the verb meaning “polish”: I shone a table that she had just aerosolled. But the regular form shined is usual when it’s a matter of polishing shoes: \n His shoes were shined to perfection. \n American writers make more use of shined, not only when the verb means “polish,” but as an alternative in other senses of shine: \n The day shined blankly. \n  . . . shined a flashlight through the hole \n Everybody in the team shined. \n Such uses of shined are regarded as standard by Webster’s English Usage (1989), though in data from CCAE, shone still outnumbers shined overall by a factor of 2:1. Canadian English Usage (1997) notes it as an acceptable but less common form. The transformation of shine into a regular verb is thus ongoing, even in North America.

		"explanation":"Abstract nouns are still being formed with this Old English suffix. They include words associated with particular skills or pursuits, such as: \n courtship friendship horsemanship \n marksmanship salesmanship scholarship \n  showmanship workmanship \n From these have developed words referring to a distinctive status or position in a given field, as in: \n  apprenticeship championship editorship \n headship internship leadership \n lecturership tutorship \n Occasionally the suffix refers not to the role of an individual, but to a group or community with a special bond: kinship, membership, township. Fellowship is probably the most evolved of the -ship words – capable of bearing either the second or third sense, and even functioning as a verb in church communities: they fellowship(p)ed after the service.

Database evidence is naturally scarce, though shat is more frequent than shitted in the BNC, and there’s scant evidence of shit as a past tense in CCAE (only shat and shitted).

	{
		"title": "should or would",
		"explanation":"In current English should and would diverge very markedly in their use, leaving few points at which you might choose between them. They originated as the past forms of shall and will, and like them used to alternate with each other in first, second and third person constructions (see shall or will section 1). But would is now almost invariably used for expressing the future-in-past for all three persons, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. For example: \n I said I would expect to come. \n You said you would expect to come. \n They said they would expect to come. \n Should serves to express prediction/volition instead of would only in deferential style. Compare: \n I should like to come \n I would like to come \n I should be delighted \n I would be delighted \n This rather formal style is much more British than American. Comparative data from the BNC and CCAE show that its use is seven times more frequent in the UK than the US. Even in the UK, I should is increasingly formulaic, largely confined to the common verbs of thinking and feeling, e.g. hope, like, think – and to the first person singular. The linguistic constraints on it are tighter than for shall in its formal and polite uses (see shall or will sections 2 and 3). \n Other uses of should make it a modal verb of obligation and necessity, whereas would continues to express volition and/or future possibilities, on which see below. An overview of the relationship between should, would and other modal verbs is to be found under modality. \n 1 Current uses of should. The major role of should nowadays, in English everywhere, is to express obligation or necessity: \n We should call for submissions from the public. \n A teacher should have a sense of humor. \n The budget should have been submitted with the proposal. \n Should combines freely with other auxiliaries marking aspect and voice, according to the Longman Grammar, and in nonfiction writing especially with the passive (as in the third example). Alternatives to should in this sense are the semi-modals ought (to) and need (to): see under ought and need. \n Should is also frequently found in subordinate clauses (content clauses) that express a wish, a plan, a judgement or an obligation: \n They proposed that we should meet next month. \n It’s important that we should meet soon. \n His insistence that we should meet soon carried the day. \n In British English, should constructions like these are the commonest alternative to the mandative subjunctive, though not in American and other varieties (see under subjunctive). \n Meanwhile should appears less and less often in conditional statements: \n If I should never return, you will have proof of their menace. \n Should they ask questions, their support is not to be counted on. \n Conditional uses of should now sound rather lofty, though the inverted should at the start of the clause is still a neat way of prefacing a condition. \n 2 Current uses of would. Apart from being the usual way to express the hypothetical future, would often expresses willingness and preference, as in I would support that line. With third person subjects, it expresses a moderate degree of probability: \n He would have come if he had known. \n The example shows also how would readily combines with have/has to mark the perfect aspect of the verb, as noted in the Longman Grammar. \n Less common uses of would are to voice a conjecture, and to formulate a habit: \n That would be the first time they admitted it. \n She would walk for half an hour every morning. \n Would is also found in some conventional expressions of politeness: \n Would the ladies please step this way. \n If you would care to look at the screen . . .  \n It would be a pleasure. \n The polite use of would is often underscored, as in these examples, by its combination with other signals of politeness, e.g. “please,” “care to.” \n The contraction ’d, commonly found in conversation, is a reduced form of would rather than should. On phonetic grounds it could hardly be should, given that sh is a distinctly formed consonant and much less likely to merge with the following vowel than w,which is a semi-vowel."

The Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes that showed is used as an alternative only in active constructions, whereas shown can be either active or passive.

The form shredded is now far more common than any verbal use of shred, past or present, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC. Its uses in culinary products such as shredded cabbage/coconut/lettuce/wheat are matched by those freely formed outside the kitchen such as shredded paper, a shredded tyre, tents shredded by the storm. Shredded is also the form used for simple and compound past tenses: \n He shredded official documents before vacating his office. \n N’s confidence was shredded by his rival’s desire to win. \n Meanwhile shred is much more often used for the noun (not a shred of evidence) than as the verb’s present or unmarked tense."

		"explanation":"This verb has long had three principal parts: shrink/shrank/shrunk. Yet while shrank is the standard past tense, shrunk is not uncommonly heard instead of shrank, and certainly not an archaism, as Fowler (1926) thought. Mid-C20 regional surveys in eastern and mid-western US found 80% of respondents used shrunk rather than shrank, and it went round the world in the 1989 movie title Honey, I shrunk the kids. Still shrunk appears less often than shrank in American writing. In data from CCAE, the ratio of shrunk to shrank is about 1:5, though the examples show a range of constructions, transitive and intransitive: \n International interest shrunk as the cold war ebbed. \n Cold weather shrunk the attendance at the fair. \n Their lead shrunk to 31–25 at half time. \n  . . . a dry cleaner that shrunk his shirt. \n N. shrunk back in the chair. \n All this makes shrunk an acceptable alternative past tense in American English, and it’s presented as such in Merriam-Webster (2000). But there’s no recognition of it in New Oxford (1998), and less evidence of its use in British writing: just a sprinkling of examples in BNC data. \n Note that shrunken is strictly an adjective, as in a shrunken head or, figuratively, a shrunken market."

It usually appears in italics, and is framed by square brackets rather than parentheses, to show that it’s an editorial interpolation. (See further under brackets.) \n Sic is essentially a neutral device which says “That’s how it was.” Yet because it questions the wording of another writer, it introduces a critical element. Done too often, it also distracts from the substance of the quotation. One of the less attractive suggestions of Maggio’s Nonsexist Wordfinder (1988) was to use sic to mark sexist usage of man, etc. whenever it turned up in quotations.

		"explanation":"Many English words have silent letters in their spelling, i.e. ones which do not correspond to a particular sound in the pronunciation. Quite often they represent sounds which were heard in the word centuries ago, as with knife, light, write. Some silent letters were added to words in early modern English, either to connect the English spelling with classical antecedents, as with debt, isle, rhyme; or to distinguish homophones, as with grille, racquet, sheriff. The examples show that most letters of the alphabet can be silent in a few words. \n The most common silent letter of all in English is e. It has developed several roles as a diacritic marker of the sound values of adjacent letters. Following a c or g, as in traceable or wage, the e serves to “soften” the sound. (See further under -ce/-ge.) In many simple words it serves to show that the vowel before the preceding consonant is long or else a diphthong. Compare: \n mate with mat \n mete with met \n bite with bit \n rode with rod \n tube with tub \n Silent letters have often been the target of spelling reformers, who are inclined to see them as phonetic deadwood. This makes them overlook what silent letters do for visual recognition of words, helping us to distinguish homophones at first glance (e.g. sign/sine), and forging links between related words whose pronunciation sets them apart (e.g. sign/signify).

		"explanation":"The use of single or double consonants is often crucial to the identity of words, witness latter and later, supper and super. In some verbs this makes the contrast between present (write) and past (written), and is again a fixed and permanent aspect of the spelling. Yet the use of single and double consonants is also a variable aspect of some words. Like many spelling variables its roots go back to C18. Johnson vacillated over it, and in his dictionary of 1755 we notice pairs such as distil and instill, and downhil versus uphill. Discrepancies like those suggest that earlier on in the dictionary he applied a spelling rule which he later abandoned. The practice of reducing two ls to one at the end of a word underlies certain distinctive British spellings, such as appal, enthral, extol which contrast with American appall, enthrall, extoll. It was also applied in the middle of words such as: \n already altogether chilblain dulness fulfil \n fulness skilful wilful \n The double l has returned to dullness and fullness, and to the second element of fulfill for many people. American English also has it in skillful and willful (see further under individual headings). \n In loanwords, the tendency to replace double with single consonants can also be seen (though more erratically). It creates alternative spellings for some like cannel(l)oni, and affects consonants other than l, in cap(p)uc(c)ino, gar(r)ot(t)e, guer(r)illa. In American spelling it’s sometimes seen in diarrhea written as diarhea, and hemorrhage as hemorhage. Many loanwords like these are without analogues in English, so there’s no clear rationale for keeping the double consonant. \n All this helps to explain why the question of single or double consonants vexes many a writer. Unfortunately it does not change the fact that double consonants are fixed into the spelling of many English words by virtue of their etymology. It is still considered a mistake to write accomodation for accommodation, exagerate for exaggerate etc."

Yet sunk is sometimes heard and seen instead of sank, as in: \n . . . the round table approach which sunk the Communist party. \n The last European to try it sunk $5 million into the production. \n . . . inspect the barge for damage incurred when it sunk in November. . . \n It took some time before the lesson sunk in \n That’s what sunk me. \n Examples like these – all from writing – show how the typical site for sunk as the past tense is a subordinate clause. It is commoner in American than British English, in comparative data from CCAE and the BNC; and sunk is allowed as an alternative past form in Merriam-Webster (2000) but not in New Oxford (1998). \n The older past participle sunken is rarely found nowadays in the verb phrase, and mostly serves as an adjective, as in a sunken garden. However sunk too can be an adjective, in technical expressions such as sunk fence."

Sissy remains the only spelling in North America, according to Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998).

		"title": "skeptic or sceptic, skeptical or sceptical, and skepticism or scepticism",
		"explanation":"Skeptic perpetuates the Greek form of the word and was indeed the earlier form in English, which helps to explain its use in American English. It was also used by Dr. Johnson in his dictionary, and preferred by Fowler (1926) because it works better in terms of English spelling-sound conventions (see -ce/-ge). The Oxford English Dictionary (1989) gives priority to the French-style spellings with sc, and British writers in the BNC overwhelmingly prefer them, despite the occasional confusion of sceptic with septic, as in: the Chelsea (football) captain has a sceptic foot and is very doubtful! \n Skeptic/skeptical/skepticism are standard in the US, and preferred by many Canadians, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). Australians generally side with the British, despite the skeptics among them (see Murray-Smith, 1989). \n In choosing between skeptic/sceptic and skeptical/sceptical, writers of the world unite in preferring the latter for the adjective. Meanwhile skeptic/sceptic is used as a noun in about 90% of all occurrences of the word in the BNC, and 99% in CCAE. \n International English selection: The classical spellings skeptic/skeptical/skepticism recommend themselves in terms of etymology, as well as being more straightforward in terms of pronunciation. This is an advantage for second-language users of English in Europe and elsewhere, apart from their strong base in North America."

It happens when skewer, used in North American English to mean “criticize” (as in the research has been both applauded and skewered) appears instead of skew (meaning “distort, bias,” as in results skewed by sampling error). Examples from CCAE include: \n The analysis could be skewered by the practice of rehiring. \n Spike Lee’s skewered gaze at a black college \n I have a very skewered version [of the book/movie], because of the people who write to me. \n As in all those cases, skewer is used where you would legitimately expect skew."

Skilful has since become the standard spelling in the UK, used in over 95% of all instances in BNC data.

		"title": "slang",
		"explanation":"Broadly speaking slang is language which refuses to conform. It sidesteps the vocabulary of standard English, and creates its own, sometimes offhanded and casual (like cop), sometimes direct and coarse (like rip off and in the shit). Slang has frontiers with colloquial language, as well as with the taboo and obscene. \n Unlike standard language slang is always somewhat limited in its currency. It’s often short-lived – witness words such as cool, neat, unreal. Slang words of commendation never seem to last long, and even those for tangible things (the flicks) lose their currency over time. A few slang words work their way into the standard: bus, cheat, dwindle, mob are examples from C18. But thousands more live and die in the same century, and even the same decade. \n The currency of slang is often limited also by being used by a particular group of people, defined by their age, social class, occupation or recreation. The use of bad (badder, baddest) to mean “great” has been part of youth slang, just as googly is best known among cricketers and their fans. The knowledge of such terms and the natural right to use them goes with belonging to such groups, and the words also serve to exclude those who do not belong. Many slang words are limited geographically. Some are confined to the US or the UK, and some only used in a particular state or region, such as the Deep South or Texas. (See further under dialect.) \n All these limitations on slang help to explain why it’s usually avoided in formal prose, and in any writing which has to communicate to a wide audience or withstand the test of time. It is more than a matter of style, if you want to be sure that the meaning gets through. Ronald Reagan puzzled the international community as to what deficiencies of character went with the American word flaky. Slang is a liability if you forget or don’t know the limits of its use. \n The vigor and vitality of slang still makes it a useful resource now and then for making a point. A phrase like golden handshake expresses a certain cynicism about the retirement packages offered to company directors, in a way that the standard phrase never could. The Hansard records of parliament nowadays include the slang uttered by members in the course of debate, to ensure that the flavor of the debate comes across along with its substance. \n ♦ See further under colloquialisms, jargon and rhyming slang."

British speakers and writers use it informally to mean “criticize strongly,” as in the products are slated as boring and overpriced. North Americans meanwhile use it to mean “propose” or “schedule,” especially in the passive, as in the headline Scottish artworks slated to go west, or the trial was slated for November. This “American” usage is now catching on in Britain, and is actually more common than the British use of slated in written data from the BNC."

	{
		"title": "slay, slew, slue and slough",
		"explanation":"The verb slay has two almost opposite senses: \n 1 “kill” in older and literary usage, and \n 2 “overwhelm with pleasure or amusement,” in colloquial usage \n For the first sense the past tense is slew (St George slew the dragon) and the past participle slain. For the second it becomes a regular verb with past form slayed, as in she really slayed them. \n Quite independent of slay is the nautical verb slew, used to mean “swing around,” “skid,” with slewed as past tense/participle: the plane slewed to the right. In British English, slewed is also an informal word for “intoxicated.” In American English slew can also be spelled slue, as in the plane slued to the right, but it’s a rarely used alternative in data from CCAE. \n Meanwhile slew also does service as a noun in the idiom a slew of meaning “a lot of.” Based on Irish slua (“army”) it originated in North America, and appears in less formal writing in both the US and the UK, by the evidence of CCAE and the BNC: a slew of films / papers / endorsements / software packages. Non-Americans would be surprised to find that this use of slew is sometimes mistakenly spelled slough, as in “a slough of papers.” This has less to do with the despond they create than the fact that the word slough (“bog”) is commonly pronounced “slew” in American English – everywhere except in New England, according to Merriam-Webster (2000). In idiomatic uses of slough, such as a slough of despair/ignorance/materialism, the noun following is singular rather than plural. Merriam-Webster does not allow slough as an alternative spelling for slew as a noun. \n Slough is nevertheless connected with other variant spellings in Merriam-Webster. Slue is an accepted alternative for the noun slough (“bog”), while sluff is listed for the verb slough (“cast off ”). Both reflect common (local) pronunciation, and find ways out of the slough of confusion that goes with words ending in -ough. See further under -gh."

		"title": "sled, sledge, sleigh, toboggan or luge",
		"explanation":"The first three words all go back to a Dutch word for a snow vehicle. Sled is the general term used in North America for vehicles on which loads or people are towed, or for the downhill slide enjoyed by children. In Britain both are called a sledge. The term sleigh distinguishes the larger type of sled(ge) used especially for ceremonial purposes (not to mention Father Christmas / Santa Claus). Both sleigh and sled(ge) have runners for smooth riding, whereas toboggans usually do without them – which makes for more exciting travel. Toboggan is a loanword from Canadian Indians, but well known internationally through having long been an Olympic sport. Much more recent is the luge (borrowed from Swiss French), a light racing sled with runners, which is ridden supine (feet first) to enhance the thrills."

(See further under -ed section 1). \n Note also that smell can be followed by either an adjective or an adverb: \n It smelled good. \n It smelled strongly of coffee. \n In the first sentence, smelled acts as a copular verb; in the second it expresses a material event.

The regular spelling smily (see -e) was preferred by the Oxford Dictionary (1989); but it has no currency in data from the BNC or CCAE, and neither New Oxford (1998) nor Merriam-Webster (2000) mentions it. Perhaps Le Carr´e’s spy master George Smiley, and Jane Smiley, the American prize-winning novelist, have stamped the -ey spelling on our consciousness. At any rate, smiley has a hold on the future as the spelling for one of the best known emoticons. It turns the round-faced icon into one that’s more elongated [ :>)], but still a token of the happy writer in e-mail or other correspondence. See further under emoticons."

		"title": "smitten",

The only question is whether to construe it with by or with. The British make about equal use of the two constructions, in BNC examples such as smitten with remorse or by homesickness, smitten with Steve or by Sandra’s good looks. Americans are more inclined towards smitten with when it’s a case of X falling in love with Y: smitten with a handsome priest / hippie artist.

Smolder is the older of the two, first recorded as a verb in C15. Its origins are rather obscure, and it seems to have gone underground during C17 and C18 – much like the kind of fire it refers to – before being revived in C19 by Sir Walter Scott."

		"title": "SMS",
		"explanation":"This abbreviation is explained as “short messaging service” or “short message system,” reflecting the service-provider’s point of view, and that of the user. SMS represents a large slice of telecommunicated conversation among young people. It provides shortened forms of words and phrases, often omitting the vowels as in TXT for “text,” and using letters and numbers for their sound values, as in CUL8R (“see you later”), or just the first letters of words of a formula, e.g. BTDT (“been there done that”). The SMS handheld device completes the standardized items for the user after one or two letters have been provided, and so a thumb is all that’s needed to set up the message. SMS conversations are limited by the resources of the code, yet they have their own kind of appeal even on larger computer screens, and extensions of SMS are used among members of certain internet communities. One such is l33tsp34k, i.e. “LeetSpeak,” where the first element is “elite.” The fact that SMS engages people so strongly does not mean the end of English or literacy as we know it – just a hi-tech example of the age-old pastime of sharing a code."

	{
		"title": "sneaked or snuck",
		"explanation":"After centuries of regular behavior, sneak has acquired an irregular past form snuck alongside sneaked. Whatever its dialect origins, snuck was first recorded in the southern US, in later C19. It has since crept into American written usage via fiction and humorous journalism, and is increasingly used as a simple alternative to sneaked: \n . . . an intelligence agent snuck him on board an American submarine \n Like it or not, disco has snuck back. \n In CCAE data, snuck appears in about 30% of all instances of the past, and is gaining on the 2:7 ratio vis-`a-vis sneaked which was reported in the American Heritage Dictionary (1991). In Canada snuck has made rapid strides towards acceptability even in more formal styles, according to Canadian English Usage (1997). British writers still keep it at arm’s length, where it appears in less than 10% of expressions of the past tense. \n The trend towards using snuck reverses the usual pattern whereby regular verbs stay regular, and at most acquire irregular past participles over the course of time. See further under irregular verbs section 9."

		"title": "snicker or snigger",

Rockefeller Sr., where the British use Snr: Douglas Fairbanks Snr (or else Sen.: see under Sen.). The British use of Snr for “Senior” may be driven partly by the need to reserve Sr for “Sister” in the nursing service or religious orders, for example Sr Gillian Price, a nun based in Hertfordshire – though its position before the name makes it different from American Sr. anyway.

		"title": "so",
		"explanation":"A chameleon word, so takes its color and meaning from the context – the surrounding words and/or the physical context and particular people involved. This gives it advantages in conversation, where it occurs two or three times more often than in writing, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). It frequently appears as an amplifier or intensifier, as in I was so distressed/excited/pleased/scared, and in American conversation so is more frequent than very. When conversing we also use so as an affirmative pro-form – I think so, they hope so – to pick up a predication made by the previous speaker (see further under pro-forms). \n Over and above all these roles, so very often serves in conversation as a linking adverb (or conjunct), as in: \n They came on Friday. So did the other speakers. \n The program has almost half finished. So let’s make the coffee. \n Appearing at the start of a supplementary utterance, so links it cohesively with what went before (see further under coherence or cohesion). At the same time it can serve other discoursal purposes. In the first example it’s also a pro-form, and in the second it signals a kind of inference or consequence. Inferential so often draws on things understood by the people communicating, which are not explicit in the wording (e.g. you wouldn’t start watching a program that’s half over). Thus so supports the interpersonal aspects of discourse rather than the logical or referential (see interpersonal). \n What makes so a useful bond in speaking can be a liability in writing, where ambiguity is to be avoided and logical relations spelled out. This is why older usage commentators preferred to have so combined with other conjunctions (forming the subordinator so that and the coordinator and so). So that can still be ambiguous, because of its capacity to express purpose as well as inference/result. See for example: \n They left two hours early so that nothing was left to chance. \n The sentence is no less ambiguous than when linked with so on its own: \n They left two hours early so nothing was left to chance. \n To clearly express a purpose, the sentence needs to replace so (that) with in order to or so as to (leave nothing to chance). To express result, the sentence has only to replace so that with and so. \n Ambiguity apart, the last example makes so a conjunction in its own right – something which traditional grammarians could not contemplate, since for them it was an adverb. Yet the linking adverb/conjunct of conversation is readily turned into a conjunction in the process of transcribing: \n The program has already half finished, so let’s make the coffee. \n Compare this sentence with the previous example. In both, so becomes a full conjunction, coordinating the two parts of the sentence (see further under conjunctions). The New Oxford (1998) presents so as a conjunction in its own right, as well as part of a complex conjunction (so that). Other dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster (2000) acknowledge it as a “sentence connector.” The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) found the use of so as conjunction “rather informal,” though Webster’s English Usage (1989) argued that this stylistic judgement was difficult to prove. Burchfield (1996) finds so “unobjectionable” as a conjunction, given mounting evidence of its use in standard fiction and nonfiction."

		"title": "sobriquet or soubriquet",
		"explanation":"This French loanword, borrowed in C17, provides a lofty way of referring to a nickname, or (less often) an assumed name. A so(u)briquet can be applied to an individual or a group: “Colonel Screwtop” for a certain World War II commander, and “Flying Circus,” the jokey name among the Allies for a task force of the German Luftwaffe. It can be affectionate or a putdown, in keeping with the original French meaning as “a tap on/under the chin.” The standard spelling is sobriquet, which dominates in US English and is preferred in the UK. But the C19 alternative soubriquet appears in 25% of all instances of the word in BNC data. For other terms for an assumed name, see under nom de plume."

	{
		"title": "social or sociable",
		"explanation":"Applied to people, these mean much the same. Compare: \n They’re very social people. \n They’re very sociable people. \n The difference – if any – is that social embodies the more abstract idea of being inclined to seek the society of others, whereas sociable suggests being ready to make friends and be good company. \n Beyond that sociable has few applications while social has very many. It represents the more abstract and impersonal notion of society at large, in phrases such as social problems, social structure, social welfare. Other aspects of social can be seen in the oppositions it enters into. The social sciences contrast with the physical/natural sciences in terms of subject matter (or with the so-called “hard” sciences, in terms of methodology). Social events contrast with those at which matters of business are paramount. The social club distinguishes itself from ones set up for more specific purposes, such as the tennis club or the wine club. \n The antonym of sociable is unsociable, which simply means “not disposed to be convivial.” Antisocial is sometimes used that way as well, as in: \n I’m going to be antisocial and watch the TV news. \n However antisocial can also mean “negatively oriented towards the community at large,” as in:  \n . . . antisocial, aggressive conduct and delinquent acts \n Unsocial is occasionally used this way (mountain goats are relatively unsocial), but especially when referring to unsocial hours of work that cut into time normally reserved for social activity. Once again, the negative forms of social have a wider range of meanings than the negative form of sociable."

Yet another term, used by many when dictating or reading punctuation aloud, is stroke. This range of names goes with a variety of uses in different contexts. \n 1 The solidus in plain text. The prime function of the solidus is to link words which are alternatives, and invite the reader to consider each in turn: \n They will sponsor road/rail transport for the teams. \n Each applicant must submit his/her birth certificate. \n Sometimes the solidus offers alternative readings of the same word, as in: \n Everyone can bring their own friend/s. \n Style guides such as the Chicago Manual (1993) and the Oxford Guide to Style (2002) accept also the use of solidus to include two successive months or years in a span of time, as in: \n  the June/July recess the 2001/2 financial year \n But they caution against using the solidus more generally to mean “as well as,” as in US/UK support, on the grounds that it may be misunderstood to mean “or.” A reciprocal meaning for solidus, as in an oil/water interface, is noted in Copy-editing (1992), where its role is clarified by the accompanying noun. Others would use an en dash/rule there (see dashes section 2). \n ♦ For the use of and/or to coordinate alternatives, see under that heading. \n 2 Solidus with numbers. The solidus is conventionally used as a separator in certain kinds of numerical expressions: \n ∗ in dates: 21/7/99 \n ∗ in fractions: 3/4 when the vertical setting is not available \n ∗ as a substitute for per in expressions of measurement, when the units of measurement are shown as symbols rather than full words, as in 125 km/hr. \n In the days before decimal currency, a solidus was used to separate the shillings from the pence. So 10/6 meant “ten shillings and sixpence.” \n 3 The solidus for quoting poetry. When quotations of poetry are integrated with ordinary text, the solidus serves to mark the boundary between the lines of the original verse. For example: \n The opening lines of the British national anthem: God save our gracious Queen / Long live our noble Queen contain two examples of the subjunctive. \n 4 Solidus in writing phonetics. In phonetic transcription, twin solidi (or slash brackets) are used to mark the beginning and end of the string of phonemic symbols (see further under brackets section 1d). \n Historical notes: The word solidus is Latin in origin, hence the plural solidi. It was the middle denomination of Roman currency, in the series librae, solidi, denarii. When abbreviated they were l.s.d., which were then identified with the “pounds, shillings and pence” of British currency. Thus the solidus was equated with the shilling. This would explain why the solidus is sometimes called the “shilling mark.” Webster’s Third adds that the oblique line which divided the shillings from the pence (in sums like 10/6) was a straightened form of the “long s” used for shillings.

	},
	{
		"title": "-some",
		"explanation":"The string of letters -some represents two Old English suffixes, and a latter-day Greek one. The most widely used is an adjectival suffix with roots in Old English -sum, found in words such as: \n cumbersome fearsome irksome \n loathsome quarrelsome troublesome \n wearisome worrisome \n Words formed with adjectival -some are typically based on verbs, as in these cases. Occasionally the base is itself an adjective, as with fulsome and wholesome. In winsome the base was wyn, an obsolete noun for “pleasure.” The origins of handsome are rather obscure, though it seems to be related to the noun hand in rather the same way as the adjective handy, but with a shift of meaning from “convenient” to “attractive.” \n A different suffix spelled -some goes back to the Old English pronoun sum (“some”), attached to small numbers. It creates informal nouns referring to a small group, as in twosome, threesome, foursome. \n The Greek combining form -some (“body”) is distilled out of neoclassical terms such as chromosome, and applied in others such as lysosome, monosome."

		"explanation":"In database evidence, someone is more than twice as common as somebody, in both the US and the UK (see -one or -body).

The second element (-body/-one) suggests that the following pronoun/determiner should be singular, but this involves choosing between him/his and her, both of which are regrettably specific in terms of gender. Many people therefore prefer to use them/their, in spite of their historical association with the plural. See further under agreement section 3."

		"title": "sometimes and sometime",
		"explanation":"These indefinite words are definitely fluid in their meanings. Though sometimes is purely an adverb, sometime can be either adverb or adjective. Compare: \n They sometimes arrive unannounced. \n Come up and see me sometime. \n They flew in sometime last week. \n Meet Mr K., resident and sometime mayor of Richmond. \n The time reference in sometime(s) varies with the context, as the examples show. Sometimes in the first embraces both past and future in stating a recurrent event. In the next two examples with sometime (as adverb), the time reference is framed in the future or past by the tense of the verb. The fourth sentence shows sometime as an adjective when its meaning is usually retrospective: “for a period in the past.” However it can also mean “occasional” and even “transient” in the phrase a sometime thing – popularized by its use in the (1935) Gershwin song A woman is a sometime thing. This usage is confirmed by several post-World War II citations in the Oxford Dictionary (1989) as well as Webster’s English Usage (1989), yet it has been rejected by successive usage panels associated with the American Heritage Dictionary (1969–2000). It seems to have originated in the South, and worked its way into mainstream American English, according to Webster’s English Usage. \n Both sometimes and sometime have slightly changed meanings when set as two words: \n Some times when I visit he doesn’t know me. \n We’ve had some times together since then. \n Can you find some time to meet me on Friday? \n They’ll spend some time in Budapest. \n In the first three sentences, time(s) means particular times or occasions; in the fourth, it means a period of time."

		"explanation":"This is both a considered phrase, as in this sort of criticism, and a conversational hedge, as in he was sort of undermined by it. Both pose some questions for writers. \n Used in the singular, the phrase is normally followed by a singular noun: this sort of jazz / money / class system. As in these examples, it’s very often an abstract noun. When the phrase is partly or fully pluralized, as these sort of or these sorts of, it’s less clear whether the following noun should be singular or plural. Both constructions are quite well represented in written material from the BNC, where – paradoxically – the phrase these sort of behaves more regularly than the other, in that it’s always followed by a plural noun: these sort of fares/features/sentiments. A plural noun is also often found after the fully pluralized form of the phrase, as in these sorts of deals / incidents / kick-start measures. But it’s also found with singular nouns in about 15% of examples, such as these sorts of fibre/character/explanation. The construction with a singular noun creates an abstraction (e.g. explanation) where the plural (explanations) would make it countable and more concrete. \n Sort of is also a conversational device for hedging a statement, as in: \n I think it’s sort of employer education. \n British speakers make far more use of sort of than Americans, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. The American preference is for kind of. Frequent use of sort of for hedging purposes has generated the merged form sorta, as in It just sorta took over from that. In BNC data it’s mainly used in fiction to signal informality in the narrative voice. American journalists in CCAE also use it when reporting speech, to suggest its naturalness and authenticity: America’s land-based missiles are “sorta like a 1963 jalopy with some new parts.” \n ♦ Compare kind of."

		"title": "South African English",
		"explanation":"South Africa is one of the most multilingual states in the world, with eleven official languages, one of which is English. Afrikaans is another, a regional variety of the Dutch spoken by the first European settlers of South Africa in C17 and C18, and vigorously maintained through the political contretemps of C19 and C20. The other nine official languages are indigenous African languages of the Bantu family, the mother tongues of up to 80% of the population. Thus in South Africa, English is much more often used as a second language than as a first. \n The multilingual context helps to explain why the English used in South Africa from C19 is very diverse. Distinct varieties are associated with the major ethnolinguistic communities, i.e. Afrikaans English, Black South African English, South African Indian English as well as the South African English associated with the British community there. Collectively these varieties are also called South African English, hence some of the difficulty of discussing what is central and peripheral to it. \n The pioneering dictionary of South African English was Charles Pettman’s Africanderisms (1913), whose aim was to capture every distinctive aspect of the regional language there, from colloquial words and phrases to placenames. It included various terms not unique to South Africa, yet he was the first to record many loanwords from Afrikaans and Bantu languages which have fed into the South African variety. Later dictionary work led by William Branford and Jean Branford in the 1970s, and culminating in the Dictionary of South African English published in 1996, has focused strictly on South Africanisms. Among the 2500 words and expressions listed, about 45% are from Afrikaans and 23% from local African languages. Some of these have moved into international English, notably apartheid, kopje, trek, veld, among others from Afrikaans. \n Concern with the norms of English usage in South Africa has been vested in prescriptive dictionaries such as the Dictionary of English Usage in Southern Africa (1975), which indicated the acceptability of local terms with a cross (×) or a plus sign (+); and the English Usage Dictionary for South African Schools (1984) which included only those words which its authors regarded as “good” South African English. Normative pressures on the language are institutionalized in the English Academy of Southern Africa, which was set up in 1961 in response to the vagaries of English used in government communication. It has been slow to consider the possibility of South African English becoming “a new language” through its contact with so many others, as Ndebele commented in a celebrated speech to the Academy in 1986. Black South African English is in fact the language of unity for the majority of the population, and the future of English in South Africa would be strengthened by recognition of its use by indigenous Africans. But for the moment, the standards for written English in South Africa are those codified in British grammars and style guides. The challenge of integrating an “old” native-speaker English with the “new” English of the local non-native speakers lies ahead – as in India, Jamaica, Singapore and elsewhere.

Canadian usage goes with the American on this, according to the Canadian Oxford (1998), whereas Australian usage – like the British – is still mixed (Peters, 1995). British writers sometimes leave the capital letters off southeast Asia / south-east Asia (in about 15% of BNC examples), presumably feeling it’s a descriptive expression rather than an official name. Those bordering the Pacific Ocean do not doubt the significance of Southeast Asia as a geopolitical entity, however vast its extent from Indonesia and Malaysia through to Vietnam, and the name is always capitalized."

Newer uses of -speak make it the language of a particular medium or specialist group, as in adspeak, computer-speak, education-speak. Such compounds can be faintly pejorative, mostly because the jargon they refer to tends to be extravagant and somewhat exclusive. “LeetSpeak” or rather “l33tsp34k” on the internet is strictly for its own members (see under SMS).

		"explanation":"Though special has supplanted especial in contemporary English, especially is much more common now than specially, according to the evidence of English databases. Especially dominates by more than 8:1 in the BNC, and by 20:1 in data from CCAE. This large difference in frequency is because especially works as a general-purpose subjunct and modifier of adjectives and whole phrases, as in: \n There was nothing especially difficult in the plan. \n She wanted it especially for the children. \n The meaning of especially ranges from “very” (an intensifier) in the first example, to “above all” (a particularizer) in the second. In conversation specially could be used in such sentences, but in writing it would look somewhat informal. \n Specially does however have an adverbial use of its own, meaning “for a specific purpose,” as in: \n . . . specially commissioned music \n . . . a chair specially designed for people with short legs \n As in those examples, specially typically modifies the past participle of a verb, and is technically an adjunct rather than a subjunct.

	{
		"title": "spelling, rules and reforms",
		"explanation":"English spelling is the product of a long period of evolution. It embodies the changing culture of centuries of history. It preserves mutants and fossils along with the mainstream of more or less regularly spelled words. Some claim that about 85% of English words conform to spelling rules, though the irregular ones are the focus of most comment and criticism. See for example sets such as: \n cough dough plough rough through \n thorough (words with the same spelling but different sounds) \n eat meet key quay chief \n receive people police ski amoeba \n faeces (multiple spellings for the same sound) \n There are thus two dimensions of irregularity in English, where other languages such as French and German have only the second. Cutting across both is the extent to which the spelling of individual words or groups reflects their origins. These several factors explain why English spelling rules rarely work in 100% of cases, and why attempts at regularizing English spelling have always been piecemeal. \n 1 Spelling adjustments of the past. Attempts to reconnect the spelling of English words with their sounds are to be found in almost every century. Anglo-Norman scribes revised the spelling of various consonants and vowels in the wake of the Norman Conquest, bequeathing us digraphs such as gh and th, and respelling sequences such as -es/-se with -ce (as in once, bodice, dice). The introduction of printing to England in C15 created multiple spellings for many words as printers grappled with new technology. They reduced the blank spaces in a line by adding an extra e to words here and there, or swapping an i for a y. These erratic uses of spelling (as well as shifting pronunciations which changed the relationship between sounds and letters) left C16 scholars skeptical about linking a word’s spelling to its sound, and more inclined to base it on its historical form. Renaissance scholarship brought to light the classical antecedents of many English words, showing how the spelling had diverged over the centuries, and confirming some of the respellings which had already begun to filter through from French sources. Though the classical respelling movement petered out in France, it continued in England, adapting loanwords which had been left untouched in French. This accounts for the bracketed letters in all of the following, which were spelled without them in Middle English: \n a(d)venture dou(b)t fau(l)t recei(p)t t(h)rone \n Some medieval and Renaissance respellings were misguided. Words with no classical ancestry were touched up according to classical spelling analogies: \n a(d)miral – from Arabic (made like admire) \n i(s)land – from Old English (made like isle) \n s(c)ythe – from Old English (made like scissors) \n Debate continued as to whether it was more useful to base spelling on the etymology or the sounds of a word. But the spelling of most common words was standardized during C17, and only fine-tuning took place in C18, such as removing “superfluous letters” (as in logic[k] and music[k]), and the respelling of k with the French qu, as in quay and cheque. \n 2 Standardization in English spelling. In comparison with pronunciation, spelling is very highly standardized, yet not all English words have the same spelling everywhere. The biggest divide in spelling is between British standard spelling and the American standard, both of which are known in Canada, Australia and elsewhere. American spelling sometimes differs from British when it preserves the older forms (as with check (“money order”), and skeptic), which were taken across the Atlantic in C17 and C18, and untouched by the francophile tastes of Victorian England. Later British spelling often differentiates words (such as ensure/insure and kerb/curb) which have the same spelling in American English. In general British spellings follow those of Dr. Johnson’s dictionary of 1755, while American spellings are mostly in line with those of Webster’s dictionaries of 1806 and 1828. American spelling applies the rules to more of the susceptible words in any set, and is less inclined to create exceptions on grounds of etymology. In Britain the reverse is true. So American English uses -ize everywhere possible, allowing it in words like advertize and realize where etymology argues for -ise. It extends the rule to words with -yze, preferring analyze to analyse. The main points on which American and British spelling differ systematically are detailed in entries such as: \n ae/e i/y -ize/-ise- -l/-ll -l-/-ll- oe/e -or/-our -re/-er -yze/-yse \n Overall American spelling is more standardized than British, though not without its own anomalies. \n 3 Spelling rules. All varieties of English make use of certain conventional practices in spelling, which are presented with examples at the following entries: \n -c/-ck- -ce/-ge doubling of final consonant -e -ed -f >-v- ie > y i before e -o -y > -i \n The extent to which these rules are applied is nevertheless somewhat variable. In cases such as doubling of final consonant, -e and -ed, this contributes to British–American divergence. \n 4 Spelling reform. Most spelling reformers recognize that it is an enormous challenge to overhaul the present system and iron out its inconsistencies – even in one English-speaking country like Australia, let alone through the whole English-speaking world. There is no constitutional authority to enforce spelling changes, and even if there were, it seems doubtful whether people would be willing to follow it to the letter. Dr. Johnson doubted whether British citizens of C18 would have been willing to obey the dictates of a language academy, and his arguments still ring true today: \n The edicts of an English academy would probably be read by many only that they might be sure to disobey them . . . The present manners of our nation deride authority . . . \n Yet we could perhaps achieve something by way of streamlining, preferring more regular spellings wherever they are already used by a group of significant size, or familiar even as minority variants. In Britain and Australia, spellings such as archeology, color, defense, fulfill, spelled, traveler (and others in each set) would be prioritized. In North America it would involve words currently spelled -er rather than -re (preferring centre to center). None of these spelling adjustments would be revolutionary. They simply represent further extensions of rules which are already applied in the region to the spelling of other words. \n A more proactive step, though still not revolutionary, would be to extend a standardized spelling to all words in large sets such as the following: \n -able/-ible -ant/-ent -er/-or \n In each case the vowel is indeterminate, whatever variety of English you speak (see schwa). The rationale for spelling the suffix this way rather than that is buried in individual word history, and makes no difference to the meaning. Some pairs in each set are already interchangeable, for example: collapsable/collapsible, dependant/dependent, convener/convenor. Because neither the sound or meaning of the suffixes is affected, it seems perverse that differences in spelling should be maintained for so many of them – differences which may get the better of otherwise excellent writers. It would be a kindness to all to allow alternatives, or else to suggest that the most common suffix in each set (-able, -ent, -er) be used for all words included in it. Those who wished could of course continue to use the traditional spelling for each word in the set. Others could use a standardized spelling for the suffix, without fear of being ridiculed for bad spelling. It seems unfortunate when adults with a full secondary education still have to reach for the dictionary. The arbitrariness of the spelling system may be the problem, rather than the adequacy of the education system! A strategic policy of reform, that embraces traditional spellings while targeting standardized ones for the future could facilitate transitions that otherwise seem unthinkable. This would lighten the load for both first- and second-language learners, consolidating the rules that are already there, and progressively streamlining the spelling system. \n 5 Trimmed spellings. The redundancies of English spelling have been noted by language scholars since C17, though relatively few words have had their silent letters removed. In some cases, there may be good reasons for retaining them (see further under silent letters). Other words could lose a letter or two from their conventional spelling with no loss of identity. Webster listed many in his much published C18 spelling book, such as bilt, bred, frend, giv, hed, relm, all of which speak their meaning perfectly well in the reduced form. Others like altho, prolog, tho, thoro, thru were among the 300 recommended by the Simplified Spelling Board in 1906, which President T. Roosevelt endorsed as US government style – but he was quickly overruled. Since then advertisers and others have launched trimmed spellings such as donut, lite, nite, sox, thru with some success, in that they are known worldwide. Yet only lite seems to appear in standard prose (see individual headings). English-users generally are strongly constrained by pressures to use conventional spellings, and to avoid the trimmed versions which would be more straightforward and efficient. \n Communicators on the internet and via SMS have nevertheless taken things into their own hands with a repertoire of curtailed spellings, such as U (“you”), F2F (“face to face”): see further under SMS. As in these examples, they tend to reduce whole syllables to a single letter. Some are more transparent than others, but they circulate widely on the internet, and could be established through it. By the same token they are mostly used for social communication, as a colloquial style to counter the impersonality of the digital medium. There’s little incentive to use them in less personal forms of communication, so their passage into standard English style should never be taken for granted. We need not fear a future of monosyllabic, acronymic prose."

British English prefers spick and span, and American spic and span, by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE, although in each case the database shows minority use of the other spelling. The phrase is quite often hyphened in attributive use, as in a spic-and-span Dutch ship, but sometimes also when used predicatively: the room is impossibly spick-and-span (see hyphens section 2c). Whichever way, it abbreviates the Middle English phrase spick and span-new (“absolutely new”), which embellished the Old Norse span-nyr (“a new chip”) with the English spick (“spike, nail”) – when fresh carpentry was a general sign of newness. 2 a racist term for a “Hispanic.” In American English this is spelled both spic and spick.

In Oxford Dictionary (1989) citations from C19, span and spun appear in equal numbers. But spun has since prevailed in both literal and more figurative uses of the word: the vehicle spun out of control; he spun out the agony. The disuse of span as the past of spin probably coincides with more frequent use of the quite independent verb span meaning “extend across” (derived from the noun span). Although spatial uses of the verb span have been on record since C17, it is now very often used in relation to time and other numerical scales, as in the headline: Council rents span wider band."

		"title": "split infinitive",
		"explanation":"The “problem” of the split infinitive stems from misconceptions about English infinitives: the assumption they consist of two parts (to + the verb itself, as in to read), and that the two parts can never be split. In fact English infinitives do not necessarily come with the preceding to (see infinitives); and split infinitives were used for centuries before they became the bete noire ˆ of C18 and C19 grammarians. Their censure cast long shadows into C20, extended by computer style checkers which can so easily be programmed to pick them up. \n Reactions to the split infinitive still beg the question as to what is wrong with it. The answers to that question vary from “It’s ungrammatical” to “It’s inelegant.” The first comment has no basis, as we’ve seen. The second is often subjective, though individual cases do need to be examined in their own terms. Having an adverbial phrase between the to and the verb can make awkward reading, as in: \n I wanted to above all be near her. \n It reads more smoothly as: \n I wanted above all to be near her. \n Yet there’s no alternative place for the adverbial phrase in: \n He wanted to more than match that offer. \n A single-word adverb runs in smoothly enough, especially an intensifier: \n He wanted to really talk to her. \n If we made a point of not splitting the infinitive in that case, the result is less elegant and more ambiguous: \n He wanted really to talk to her. \n In some cases, the effort to avoid splitting the infinitive alters the meaning of the sentence. Compare: \n He failed completely to follow the instructions. \n with \n He failed to completely follow the instructions. \n There’s little virtue in a sentence which avoids the split infinitive so clumsily as to make obvious what the writer was trying not to do: \n The failure adequately to brief the pictorial editor was inexcusable. \n Most usage guides including Fowler (1926) recommend a judicious approach to splitting infinitives, and do not endorse the knee-jerk reaction of C19 pedagogues or the latter-day computer style checker. The consensus is: \n ∗ Don’t split an infinitive if the result is an inelegant sentence. \n ∗ Do split infinitives to avoid awkward wording, to preserve a natural rhythm, and especially to achieve the intended emphasis and meaning."

		"title": "spouse and spouse equivalent",
		"explanation":"The term spouse has traditionally been used for one’s married partner (man or wife). This understanding is built into the bureaucratic expression spouse equivalent, used to refer to the person involved in a long-term domestic arrangement other than that of man and wife, and to the other partner in a homosexual or heterosexual relationship. It is however a tad cumbersome, and usage has found an easier way out by stretching the meaning of spouse, to include both non-married partners, and ones of the same or different sex. These extensions to the meaning of spouse are noted in Webster’s English Usage (1989) with an example from 1975, and recognized in Canadian English Usage (1997), but not yet hinted at in the definitions of Merriam-Webster (2000) or New Oxford (1998). In the meantime, spouse itself has to be qualified, e.g. by spouse equivalent or same-sex spouse, as appropriate. Married spouse is then not a tautology. \n English presents a range of other terms for the “significant other,” though their connotations often rule them out. Lover/mistress are too direct, paramour and inamorata/o too exotic, while fiance(e) ´ invokes the very marital conventions that are being circumvented. Journalists create makeshift expressions such as apartmate and live-in friend, but neither they nor the sex therapists’ term spousal unit seem very usable. De facto, though widely used in Australia and New Zealand, sounds legalistic when applied to one’s own closest friend. Significant other itself is rather intellectual, and no more transparent when acronymized to SIGO. The term partner is probably the most serviceable of all, though subject to its own ambiguities (see partner). \n The lack of a standard term obliges people to invent their own, which is no bad thing, given the infinite variety of human relationships."

		"title": "staff, stave and staffer",
		"explanation":"Some uses of the word staff (“stick, rod”) are very old, hence the plural staves in which its ff is replaced by v (see further under -f > -v-). It still appears when the sticks referred to serve some special purpose, as ceremonial instruments or as primitive weapons, as in: \n Royal serjeants-at-arms, staves in their hands, moved into the hall.  \n . . . militants armed with iron bars and bamboo staves. \n British writers occasionally use the plural staffs in reference to historical and ritual events, as in twisted snakes on ceremonial staffs, but in BNC data it’s usually staves. Likewise tipstaves is used as the plural of tipstaff, the term used of the judge’s assistant who precedes him into court, bearing a metal-tipped staff. \n The singular stave is a C14 backformation from staves, used to refer to a strip of wood used in making vessels (barrel stave) or in the construction of buildings and fences: . . . splitting timber into staves for the stockade. Because its plural is also staves, the line between it and the plural of staff (“stick”) when used as a weapon is sometimes fuzzy. \n Stave also varies with staff in the scoring of music. It originated as a single line (=staff/stave), against which the notes were set, and was gradually extended to the set of five lines conventionally used today. In the strict sense of the word, it was a bundle of staves, but staff/stave remained the term for it, acquiring a collective meaning in the process. For musicologists, staff is the primary term, according to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2001), and it remains in staff notation. But general dictionaries vary: New Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie (1997) give priority to stave, whereas Canadian Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) make it staff. \n By far the most common use of staff these days is to refer to the body of people who work in a particular institution. Its plural is always staffs, as in their respective embassy staffs. Staff in this sense is again a collective noun, raising the question as to whether it takes a singular or plural verb in agreement. In British English both are equally common: \n They told me that the staff was/were on strike. \n American English prefers singular agreement for such collective words (see further under agreement section 1). \n Collective use of staff creates the need for a word to refer to the individual member, which can be met by staffer. The word originated in American English of the 1940s, and has since been taken up in Britain and elsewhere. Its plural is of course staffers."

This is one and the same word as stamina meaning “physical resilience.” In Latin stamen/stamina meant “thread(s),” and as Roman myth had it, the threads of life were spun by the Fates until a person’s dying day.

		"title": "stamp or stomp",
		"explanation":"The verb stamp has multiple meanings in British and American English, from stamp one’s foot to stamp a passport or having an idea stamped on or stamped out. These uses are standard everywhere, except that stomp shares the field when it comes to heavy use of the feet. In American English stomp is more frequent than stamp in this sense, in data from CCAE, whether it’s people (students clapping and stomping in their seats) or animals (herds of buffalo stomping through clouds of dust). The verb can also connote bad temper, as in stomped off in a huff / stomped out of the room, or brutality, as in stomping on his face while he lay unconscious. Stomp has dialectal origins, before making its mark in written American English in the 1910s. It has now established itself in British English, and is found in 100 or so BNC examples describing the stomping horse and the stomping noise from the kids, as well as adults who stomp away/off/out. There are a few examples of stomping ground in the BNC,though the British still prefer stamping ground – for the moment.

		"title": "standard English",
		"explanation":"People sometimes speak of standard English as if it were a simple reference norm, like a standard gauge on the railway. But what “standard” can we refer to in choosing between expressions like eccentric, off-beat, way-out, flaky? There is no easy answer, because words are not physical objects with linear dimensions. A standard in language is more abstract and more value-laden. The notion of standard English is often invoked by those who want to claim that a certain expression is correct and that another is effectively substandard. \n A less value-laden approach to standard English is to relate it to the many expressions that have a particular stylistic, regional or social character, which limits their usefulness in other contexts. Words with strong colloquial associations (such as way-out) are unsuitable for formal prose. Eccentric meanwhile is on the more formal side of the style range. This suggests that we could well define standard English as the kind of language which has no strong stylistic connotations, or – put the other way round – language which is neutral in style. An enormous body of words can in fact be used in any kind of context, forming a broad band between colloquial and slang on the one hand, and formal and technical language on the other. \n FORMAL TECHNICAL STANDARD ENGLISH COLLOQUIAL SLANG \n Apart from being stylistically neutral, standard English is neutral as to region. It avoids words with a strong local flavor, or ones which might not be understood outside the region of the world in which they are current idiom. An American colloquialism such as flaky is unsuitable for international communication. The words used in standard English could have originated anywhere in the English-speaking world. In this sense it’s close to the notion of international English (see further under that heading). \n The most contentious aspect of standard English is how far it is or can be neutral in social terms. Many would associate it with “educated English,” and this seems to make it the prerogative of those who have enjoyed access to a full formal education. Yet standard English should not be equated with written English or bookish modes of expression. Again we would assert its neutrality in the social–educational spectrum of usage, so that standard English occupies the middle ground between illiterate expression and pedantic usage. It prefers you to youse, but would not go out of its way to use whom. (See further under whom and yous.) \n Standard English is not the exclusive property of any social or regional group, but a resource to which English-speakers at large have access."

The answer from the Chicago Manual (2003) is only when it’s “an accepted part of the proper name”: compare Washington State with the state of Washington. Any references to state facilities, as in state government, need no capitalizing. The same is broadly true in Australia, where the word would be capitalized in the official title State of Victoria, but not in writing about its state schools. It thus obeys the general practices associated with institutional names (see capital letters sections 1a and 3).

Better known are the words for writers and composers of other kinds: pulpster, punster, rhymester, songster; as well as those for “con-artists” in other fields: gangster, huckster, shyster, tipster, trickster. Almost all recent formations are deprecating in some way, except youngster, and words such as dragster, roadster, speedster, teamster, which refer to a means of transport or those who use them. \n According to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), -ster has an intricate history. It was originally a female agentive which paralleled -er for males. Yet scattered evidence in the following centuries suggests that it gradually became associated with the professional conduct of a trade by either men or women, whereas the -er suffix was used for the occasional practitioner. Thus the brewer, spinner and weaver turned their hand to the trade from time to time, while those whose livelihood depended on it were named brewster, spinster and webster respectively. (Pollster is a modern example.) But the use of -ster varied in different parts of Britain, and it continued to be applied to women in the south until 1500, while carrying the professional meaning in the north from as early as 1300. The gender and professional/part-time distinctions were further complicated by the pejorative overtones of the suffix, which begin to be registered about 1400. The word spinster seems to suffer from all these complications."

		"title": "storey or story",
		"explanation":"In British English, as well as Canadian and Australian, these spellings differentiate the word for the floor or level of a building, from the word for a tale or account of something. This distinction is however less than a century old. The original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) had both spelled story, and this is current American usage. The plural for the first spelling is storeys, while for the second it’s stories. \n Whether the two words come from one and the same source is a matter of scholarly debate. Some trace both words back to the Latin storia, with the picturesque notion that the levels of older buildings were differentiated by the different tales told in their windows. Others suggest that storey (“level of a building”) developed, like the noun store, from an Old French verb estorer (“build”). \n The British use of storey entails multistorey where Americans use multistory. Other derivatives involve even more variants: two-storey or two-storeyed for the British, and two-story or two-storied for Americans.

		"title": "straight, strait and strai(gh)tened",
		"explanation":"Straight is that very common adjective describing a line or edge with no curves or kinks in it. It can also be an adverb meaning “directly” or “immediately”: \n Head straight for the river. \n Go straight to bed. \n Strait is an archaic adjective/adverb meaning “narrow” or “restricted,” which survives in compounds such as straitjacket and strait(-)laced. Both words are occasionally spelled with straight. Straightjacket has been recorded continuously since C16, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989), and is recognized as an alternative in New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000). No doubt people think of the garment as one which keeps your arms and legs straight – not just one which restricts your movements. Likewise it’s tempting to reinterpret strait-laced as straight-laced, i.e. “keeping to the straight and narrow,” especially when it goes with straight-faced. Almost half of all instances of the word in CCAE were straight-laced (mostly hyphened), and more than half in the BNC (all hyphened), and it’s recognized by the reference dictionaries. Merriam-Webster (2000) lists both straightlaced and straitlaced without hyphens, whereas New Oxford (1998) has them with. \n The phrase straitened circumstances (ones in which you feel the financial pinch) is also sometimes written as straightened circumstances.

		"title": "stratum and strata",
		"explanation":"The Latin stratum meaning “layer” was borrowed into English in C16, along with its Latin plural strata (see -um). Its technical uses in medicine and geology are now paralleled in the social sciences, with references to social and institutional levels as in a stratum of farmers or upper class stratum of entrepreneurs. Expressions like these have made it into everyday parlance, but the plural remains strata, rather than the anglicized stratums. The latter doesn’t appear in either the British or American databases, though it is occasionally heard in conversation. \n Like other Latin loanwords with plurals ending in -a, strata has been used as a singular word since C18, like candelabra and data (Peters, 2001). Collective and indeterminate uses pave the way, in examples such as the same social strata, the bottom strata of the well. Singular agreement and singular use of strata are still rare in current British English, with just a sprinkling of examples in the BNC: a strata, a particular strata, this strata. In American English it’s more freely used, judging by the more elaborate examples in CCAE, such a whole strata of music (going unrecognized), a different economic strata, the absence of that middle strata. \n The next evolutionary step is for strata to acquire its own English plural stratas. This is more often heard than seen, but the single example in CCAE adds to those recorded earlier by Webster’s English Usage (1989). Merriam-Webster (2000) notes it as “persistent” though not particularly frequent. As usage it’s no stranger than turning agenda into a singular, countable word: see agenda."

Alternatively, it might be derived from the verb string, meaning “fit with strings” or “suspend.” But its past tense and past participle are strung, whether it’s a guitar strung with fresh gut or a clothes line strung between apartment buildings. Though originally regular, the verb has used irregular parts (especially strung) since C16, according to the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Strung prevails also in more abstract and compound uses: \n He was strung up about something \n Knowing how highly strung she was . . . \n They strung the discussion out for the whole morning. \n We were hamstrung by the lack of funds."

		"title": "style",
		"explanation":"Some do it with style – and others presumably without it. But writing always has a style or styles built into it, generated by the very language used. Whether the style is formal, informal or something in between depends on the words (see formal words and colloquialisms), and the grammatical choices. A lively style makes use of active verbs and concrete imagery, and avoids too many abstractions and nominalizations. (See further under abstract nouns and nominal.) A clear style is helped by effective use of sentences, so that their length and structure correspond with the units of meaning being expressed. \n Certain writing styles have strong links with particular institutions. Documents written in the name of government often embody officialese, just as those associated with business often contain commercialese. Legal writing and scientific writing have recurrent features, such as long sentences, and passive and impersonal constructions. Many academic writers have a style which is abstract and impersonal, in keeping with the theoretical emphasis of university work. Thus the writing style of many people employed by those institutions is at least somewhat institutionalized. It may indeed be seen as part of their professional competence. Yet no-one would deny the negative aspects of institutional styles, and the need to consciously combat them with Plain English (see further under that heading). \n Institutional and professional writing often involves style in that other sense of house style, the conventions of spelling, word form, punctuation and usage to be used by everyone who works for that company or department or publisher. The style guide which describes the house style is intended to standardize the documents or publications produced, and so is normative or prescriptive. \n Individual writers are free to cultivate their own style in both senses of the word: to create their own flexible “house” style according to the various contexts in which they write; and to create their own distinctive writing style, making it clear and lively, and attractive and readable."

Horus was identified by the Greeks with Harpocrates, their god of silence, who was represented as a naked boy sucking his finger. In Roman myth, Harpocrates was given a rose by Cupid, to bribe him not to disclose the amorous affairs of Venus. Thus the rose became the symbol of silence in western civilization. In more recent times it was sculptured on the ceilings of banquet rooms, as a reminder to the diners that what was said in their cups was not to be repeated outside. A rose was also set above the door of some C16 confessionals.

The easiest way to locate the subject of each of those clauses is to identify the verb and make it the focus of a question: \n Who or what goes? (“I”) \n Who or what begins? (“wholesale business”) \n Who or what are closed? (“the stalls”) \n In statements, a subject almost always comes before the verb, though in questions it’s usually delayed until after the auxiliary part of the verb phrase.

		"title": "subjunctive",
		"explanation":"The subjunctive is a pale shadow of what it used to be. In older English grammar, the subjunctive forms of verbs diverged from those in the indicative, and were used for special purposes such as expressing a wish or a hypothesis. Compare: \n God bless America (subjunctive, for a wish) \n God blesses America with . . .(indicative, for a plain statement) \n  What’s left of the subjunctive manifests itself by default, the absence of an -s on verbs in the third person singular present tense (bless rather than blesses). \n English once had both present and past forms of the subjunctive for all verbs. But for most the only residue is the third person singular present subjunctive. As shown in the example above, it differs from the indicative in having no -s suffix. Only for the verb be is there a set of alternative forms for the present subjunctive, all of which are different from the indicative. Compare: \n I am you are he/she/it is we are they are \n (if) \n I be you be he/she/it be we be they be \n The verb be also retains some distinct forms for its past subjunctive, at least in the singular. Compare: \n I was - you were \n he/she/it was they were (indicative) - we were \n I were - you were \n he/she/it were  they were (subjunctive) - we were \n The most visible differences are in the first and especially the third person singular, and these provide us with evidence of the surviving uses of the subjunctive, detailed below. 1 The mandative subjunctive. This is the kind of construction that calls for a particular action, as in: \n They recommended that he present hard evidence for the claim. \n Mandative constructions use the present forms of the subjunctive, and so are often only detectable in the third person singular, although the switch of tenses (present following the past of the main clause) is another sign of their presence. Compare: They proposed that he come the next day. \n They proposed that we come the next day. \n Mandatives can be prefaced by any one of a number of verbs including: \n advise ask beg demand \n desire direct insist move \n order propose recommend request \n require stipulate suggest urge \n Adjectives such as essential, important, necessary, vital, and conjunctions such as in order that and on condition that, also introduce mandative clauses which typically take the subjunctive. The mandative subjunctive is used regularly in North American English, as well as Australian and New Zealand English (Hundt, 1998; Peters, 1998a; and Canadian English Usage, 1997). It appears in positive and negative constructions: \n The doctor insisted that she (not) be allowed out. \n In British English, the mandative subjunctive declined during C20, perhaps because of Fowler’s (1926) general onslaught on the subjunctive, on the basis that it was either misused or pretentious. Gowers left it unchanged in his revised version of Fowler (1965), and British grammarians since then have tended to say that it’s primarily associated with formal style, as do the authors of the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). Instead, British writers have expressed the mandative by means of the modal verb should, as in \n The doctor insisted that she should (not) be allowed out \n Signs of a late C20 revival of the mandative subjunctive in British English have been detected by Overgaard (1995), so this regional difference may disappear in C21. \n 2 The subjunctive in “unreal” or impossible conditions. The only surviving past form of the subjunctive, i.e. were, is the one most associated with expressing conditions that could never apply, after as though, as if, and especially if. \n The room had a strange effect on her, as if she were floating in space. \n If he were a good manager, I wouldn’t mind. \n But after plain if there’s a growing tendency to replace the subjunctive with indicative, whether the condition is strictly real or unreal: \n If he was a good manager I wouldn’t mind. \n The Oxford Grammar (1996) notes that the were-subjunctive is also associated with formal style, and growing use of the indicative. From the Australians surveyed (Peters, 1993a) came the comment that the use of if was all that it took to express the hypothetical condition, and so there was no need for the subjunctive. The motivation for using the were-subjunctive is stylistic rather than grammatical. \n  3 Formulaic uses of the subjunctive. In C21 English, we still use the subjunctive in conventionalized wishes and other formulaic phrases. For example: \n Be that as it may \n Come what may. \n Far be it from me. \n If I were you. . . \n If need be. \n As it were. \n God bless you.  Heaven forbid. \n Fixed expressions like these would not arrest the general decline of the subjunctive, nor decreasing use of the were-subjunctive. Yet the mandative subjunctive is still in regular use outside Britain, which could facilitate its return. Widespread and productive use makes the mandative subjunctive stylistically neutral, which enhances its chances of persisting for some time. There’s life in the old paradigm yet."

		"title": "such and such as",
		"explanation":"The grammar of such has not been well understood until recently, making it the target of anxiety and censure on several fronts. For many dictionaries it’s just a pronoun and adjective, as in the following: \n Such is the fate of many of us (pronoun) \n Such people are hard to convince (adjective) \n But these two complementary uses of such are now recognized as those of pronoun and determiner. Such is also a determiner in extended noun phrases: \n Such conscientious people are hard to convince. \n Though some dictionaries would explain its use there as that of adverb. Yet another grammatical puzzle was the construction such a, as in such a fate. The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) explains this use of such as making it a predeterminer (see further under determiners). All these are “classifying” uses of such, and important as cohesive devices in spoken and especially written discourse (see coherence or cohesion). \n In conversation, the determiner such also plays a slightly different part, that of intensifier, as in They’re such clever people. This is the usage dubbed “informal” by some usage writers, though it appears often enough in print for Webster’s English Usage (1989) to dismiss the criticism. Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) showed that intensifying use of such was twice as common in fiction and conversational data as in news reporting and academic prose. Issues of style intersect with the grammar and meaning of such in all the constructions discussed below. \n 1 Clausal links with such. Such is sometimes questioned when used in combination with relative pronouns, most notably that: \n The document was phrased in such a way that made it thoroughly incomprehensible. \n The Oxford Dictionary (volume issued in 1917) said that constructions with the relative were “rare” and “now regarded as incorrect.” Perhaps this was true for the pronouns which and who; but with that the issues are rather different. It creates a hybrid (relative–adverbial) construction, whose ambivalence presumably had to be resolved to satisfy older usage commentators. Their solution was to replace that with as, although this could not be done in all cases, as Fowler (1926) noted. Modern English grammars like the Comprehensive Grammar recognize the combination of such . . . that as a kind of correlative, and as a complex coordinator expressing result – which also lends something to the interpretation of the sentence above. Like so . . .that, the two components (such, that) can be used together or apart, but with different stylistic implications. Their use together goes with a style on the formal side of standard, as in: \n Ignorance was such that they became afraid of normal social contact. \n Such that mostly occurred in the academic texts of the Longman Grammar corpus. Meanwhile uses of such . . .that spread across other kinds of writing from news reporting to fiction; and the longer string in such a way that was one of the relatively common “lexical bundles” of conversation – more common in fact than in such a way as. Burchfield (1996) found constructions with such that and such . . . that perfectly idiomatic. \n  2 Such as to introduce examples. Such as has traditionally been preferred to like as a way of introducing examples. Compare: \n He preferred tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango. \n He preferred tropical fruits like pineapple and mango. \n The argument for such as was that it prevented the ambiguity that might sometimes beset like (though the case seems to have been exaggerated: see like section 1). Yet this concern probably explains why such as is more than a thousand times commoner in academic writing than in speech. Such as is also found in fiction and news writing, but much less often. These facts of usage make such as more formal and academic in style, whereas like is straightforward and direct. \n Pronouns following such as are normally in the accusative (objective) case:  \n . . . Stephen King. They would only consider well-known writers such as him. \n It was once argued that the nominative form (he) ought to be used in such cases, on the basis that such as introduces the remnant of an elliptical clause (such as he was). Modern grammarians are less inclined to argue from what is not there, and to allow that such as is a complex preposition rather than conjunction – which means that the accusative him is the case to use. (See further under case.) \n 3 Such as a cohesive device. Such as a pronoun/determiner is a useful aid to cohesion, which is no doubt why it often appears at the start of a sentence, in written as well as spoken discourse: \n Such is the way of the world. \n Such indifference I can’t understand. \n In each case, such forges a strong link with something said in the previous sentence or sentences, and is prominent as the first word. The second example shows how this can impact on word order, with the object of the clause moved to the front (see further under inversion). Upfront use of such is part of the fiction writer’s repertoire, by the various examples presented in the Longman Grammar. But the use of the pronoun such in mid-sentence is associated much more exclusively with legal writing. For example: \n Any person found borrowing test instruments for use at home, or using such for private purposes while on government premises will be prosecuted under Section 522 of the Government Property Act. \n The intricate language of law makes it necessary perhaps to have such rather than the regular, unobtrusive pronouns them/it. Whatever the necessity there, using such in the same way elsewhere creates an official and rather pompous style."

		"title": "suffixes",
		"explanation":"These are the add-on units at the ends of words which modify their grammar and/or meaning, witness: \n hyphen hyphens hyphenate hyphenated hyphenation \n In that set of words there are two essential types of suffixes: \n ∗ inflectional \n ∗ derivational (or lexical) \n 1 Inflectional suffixes are ones like the plural -s and the past tense -ed, which simply adapt the basic word within its own grammatical class (noun or verb in those cases). A plural noun is still a noun, just as a past tense verb is still a verb. The range of inflectional suffixes in English is quite small when compared with those of other European languages. See further under inflections. \n 2 Derivational suffixes have a much more radical effect on the word they’re attached to, often moving it from one grammatical class to another. In the set above, -ate converts the noun hyphen into a verb, while -ion turns the verb into an abstract noun. Note that suffixes which convert concrete nouns to abstract ones (cork > corkage), or to agentive nouns (farm > farmer) and vice versa, are also considered to be derivational. The range of derivational suffixes in English is very large, comprising those maintained from Old English (e.g. -dom, -ship), as well as many acquired via French and Latin loanwords (e.g. -ery, -ment), and even some from Greek (e.g. -archy, -logy). Others are the fruit of internal development in English itself, over the course of centuries (e.g. -ful, -man). \n Derivational suffixes can be grouped in terms of their effect on the grammar of words, those which convert: \n ∗ verbs into nouns, either agentive (-er, -ant, -or etc.) or abstract (-al, -ation, -ment etc.) \n ∗ adjectives/nouns into verbs (-en, -ify, -ize) \n ∗ adjectives into adverbs (-ly) \n ∗ nouns/adjectives into adjectives/nouns (-an, -ese, -ite etc.) \n ∗ concrete nouns into other types of noun (-eer, -hood, -ie, -y) \n English words often carry more than one suffix, though four derivational ones seem to be the limit. The verbal noun editorializing (edit/or/ial/iz/ing) is a useful mnemonic for this. All derivational suffixes precede inflectional ones. The last derivational suffix decides the grammatical role of the word. Note that words with three or four derivational suffixes, each of which in turn modifies the word’s role, put some strain on the reader. Writing which relies on multi-suffixed words is heavy-going (see further under nominal). The uses of many common suffixes are discussed in this book under their individual headings."

		"title": "sui generis",
		"explanation":"In Latin this means literally “of its own kind.” It is used of something which (or someone who) stands apart as the only one of their kind. Strictly speaking it’s an adverbial phrase – not a noun, a usage which the Oxford Dictionary (1989) dubbed “illiterate.” The reason for such heavy censure is not however obvious to those without Latin, and the grammar of the phrase is ambiguous in English sentences such as This publication is sui generis."

		"title": "sulfur or sulphur",
		"explanation":"In American English, sulfur is the standard spelling, where British English uses sulphur. But sulfur is also the professional choice for chemists everywhere in the world, recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The f spelling is also used in the names of sulfur compounds such as sulfuric acid, copper sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfurous when used in technical contexts. It applies also to sulfa drugs or sulfas (sometimes sulpha drugs in the UK). British writers – including scientists other than chemists – still prefer sulphur, by the almost overwhelming use of it in BNC data. Journalism that focuses on sulphur dioxide as a cause of “acid rain” uses the nonspecialist’s spelling; and it persists in the names of animals such as the sulphur-bottom (= blue whale) and the sulphur-crested cockatoo. \n Sulfur is usually traced back to Latin, where it was variously spelled sulpur, sulphur as well as sulfur. Beyond that its origins are obscure, though cognates in Germanic languages (including the Anglo-Saxon swefl, “sulfur, brimstone”) suggest that it goes back to Indo-European rather than Arabic sources (see Indo-European). Webster’s Third (1986) notes a precedent in the Oscan language, an early Italic language that was replaced by Latin. In medieval French it was sulfre, and soufre at first in Middle English. From C14 on there were more than a dozen variants with ph or f, but Johnson’s dictionary (1755) lists only sulphur, and most of the Oxford Dictionary’s (1989) citations from C18 support it. However the Dictionary acknowledges the use of sulfur in American English, and it’s clearly in line with the rational spellings endorsed by Webster. See further under spelling section 5."

Yet they differ in the way they summarize the original text. \n  ∗ An abridgement gives you a shortened version of the text of a book. The less important parts are cut out, and the rest remains in the author’s own words. \n ∗ An abstract is a very brief statement (usually one or two paragraphs) about the work reported at large in a document. The abstract pinpoints the issues addressed and the results of the inquiry, as well as the conclusions drawn from it. Abstracts are much used in reporting the essence of research endeavors in academic journals. \n ∗ A precis ´ restates the contents of a piece of writing in a much more limited number of words (usually specified).

		"explanation":"This legal noun is always construed as a singular in English, as in expecting a summons at any moment. The grammar reflects its origins as an abstract noun in Old French (sumunse), which became som(o)unce in Middle English. In C15 English it was refashioned along classical lines and with a final s, but the singular sense has survived – hence the need for the plural summonses. The noun also provides the base for the verb which is regularly inflected as summonsed, summonsing. The verb summons spells out the legal imperative for someone to appear in court, though in practice it’s the same when one is summoned."

Fowler (1926) railed at overuse of the word, and it has since fallen out of fashion like many heavily indulged words.

		"title": "superior",
		"explanation":"In Latin superior is a comparative adjective meaning “higher” – which has consequences for its use in English. One is that superior should not be further compared with “more” (which would make it a double comparative: see under that heading). Another is that when superior expresses comparisons, the prepositional link should be to rather than than, according to usage commentators as well as grammarians. For example: \n The wealthy enjoy schooling far superior to that of poor people. \n In fact most British and American writers prefer to do this, by the evidence of the BNC and CCAE. Yet the objections voiced to using than with superior suggest that it is sometimes used, and not so surprisingly when it creates comparative constructions, as in: \n Education for the wealthy is far superior than that of poor people. \n Written evidence of superior than is however elusive in both British and American databases, and it remains spoken rather than written idiom."

		"explanation":"In common usage this word means “excellent” and it lends itself to hyperbole, as on a menu card which describes a dish as: \n A superlative combination of fresh seafood, lightly cooked in batter and served with a garnish of roasted pinenuts \n This usage probably makes it an absolute adjective (see absolute section 1). \n Grammarians use superlative for the highest degree of comparison for an adjective, as freshest is for fresh (see adjectives section 2). Some superlatives nevertheless seem to exist without regular comparison, e.g. darndest (see “absolute superlatives” under absolute). \n ♦ For the use of double superlatives, see individual entry."

		"title": "superordinate",
		"explanation":"In logic and language this refers to a concept or word which is at a higher level of generality or abstraction, as residence is in relation to house, home unit, hut, mansion and weekender. The superordinate stands as a cover term for a whole class of more specific words, and includes them within its ambit.

		"title": "supersede or supercede",
		"explanation":"The spelling supersede is the standard one, reflecting the etymology of the word. Its second element is the Latin root sed- (“sit”), but it’s the only word in English which uses the root that way – hence the temptation to spell it like the larger set of those with the root cedmeaning “yield.” Supercede appears often enough in American English for Webster’s Third (1986) to register it as a variant, and Webster’s English Usage has several recent citations from later C20 prose. Data from CCAE confirms its position as the minority variant, outnumbered by supersede in the ratio of almost 1:10. In British English, supercede has been marginalized by the Oxford Dictionary’s(1989) comment on it as a “variant, now erroneous” of supersede. This is echoed by New Oxford (1998), though it does not prevent the occasional appearances of supercede in BNC data, in the ratio of about 1:50 to supersede.

There may however be regional preferences, judging by database evidence. Suppose is the only one used in BNC citations when the word is followed by that, whereas it’s supposing in American data from CCAE. Compare: \n Suppose that the Chancellor has decided in favour of the petitioner \n Supposing that I was allowed to set up my own business \n Supposing is the only possibility when the word is used as a subordinator in sentences presenting an open condition: \n We’ll go to the gallery today, always supposing it’s open. \n In such sentences supposing means “assuming.” The condition that it prefaces makes the utterance more tentative, often as a token of politeness."

The shorter spelling surveil is the only one to appear in the American data, for both military and civilian uses, as in: \n . . . ordering him not to threaten, surveil, follow or telephone her \n The Oxford Dictionary (1989) also lists surveille, which would explain the inflected forms surveilled and surveilling used even in American English (Merriam-Webster, 2000). With surveil as the base form, the double ls are irregular, because the preceding vowel (ei) is a digraph (see doubling of final consonant). The only problem is the lack of evidence for surveille in Oxford citations or CCAE. It seems that surveil itself operates under surveillance."

		"title": "suspect or suspicious, suspicion and sus(s)",
		"explanation":"These adjectives differ in that suspect applies to the object of suspicion, while suspicious describes the attitude of the person holding the suspicion. Compare: \n Their commitment to the project was very suspect. \n I was suspicious of their motives for joining the group. \n Suspicious is however also used to mean “giving rise to suspicion,” especially in police reporting on suspicious circumstances. The adverb suspiciously has to do service for both adjectives, as in: \n The children were suspiciously quiet. (their behavior was suspect) \n The teacher looked suspiciously round the room. (he had reason to be suspicious) \n Both suspicious and suspect are reduced to sus(s) in colloquial Australian usage, as in That seems pretty suss to me. \n Meanwhile in British English sus abbreviates suspicion, hence the notorious sus laws, whereby a person could be arrested on suspicion of illegal behavior. This also explains the verb suss (out), occasionally sus out: \n The counsellor came to suss me out. \n This verb meaning “investigate,” “check out” is the most frequent use of the word in BNC data. Canadians and Australians also know it, according to their respective dictionaries, but it’s not so familiar in the US, by the label “chiefly British” attached to it in Merriam-Webster (2000). Yet other British uses of suss are its role as a noun meaning “shrewdness,” as in extra degrees of vim, suss and humour, and for the related adjective meaning “shrewd.”"

It may be in the air as on a suspension bridge, or close to the ground when it’s the shock-absorbing system of a vehicle. In chemistry the word refers to being suspended in a liquid, as when particles of chalk form a suspension in water. One other use of suspension is more an administrative matter: the suspension of a driver’s licence (or anything else) means that certain rights have been temporarily withdrawn, or that a regular system of some kind has been discontinued. \n ♦ For editors in North America suspension is the technical term for one kind of contraction: see contractions section 1."

It expresses the presumed etymology of the word in an old onomatopoeic verb swappen, meaning “strike or slap hands [in a bargain].” In modern English swap also serves as a noun, as in Is this a fair swap? Though colloquial in flavor, it is a standard term in financial reporting when referring to a share swap and other kinds of swap deals. The alternative spelling swop expresses the word’s pronunciation, and is the commoner of the two, according to Gowers (1965). Yet swap outnumbers swop by about 9:1 in BNC data.

In BNC data the spelling swot is sometimes found instead, but only a minority of writers use it for this purpose. Mostly swot is reserved for a different set of colloquialisms associated with studying: the verb “stuff oneself with information for exams,” and the related nouns meaning “hard study” or “person who studies (too) hard.” None of these is used in American English."

In BNC data swathe is far more popular than swath for these applications, outnumbering it by more than 5:1. In American English the opposite holds, by the evidence of CCAE. Swath dominates in hundreds of examples like a wide swath of public opinion, and swathe is rare."

Intensifiers such as bloody and fucking are used so often in some quarters (such as a football crowd or building site) that they cease to be shocking or to offend those around. However swear words which are deliberately used to insult are likely to create shock waves even when the person targeted is thoroughly used to them.

The first group are often like abbreviations, witness the chemical symbols C for carbon and N for nitrogen. They also serve as symbols for SI units, C for the coulomb, and N for the newton. These conventional symbols are never given stops like other abbreviations. \n The symbols created by writers are different altogether. They are focal images which carry significance beyond themselves by being developed steadily through the language and substance of a literary work. Symbols often begin unobtrusively in a poem or the narrative of a novel, grounded in its physical world. But they reappear in successively different contexts, and take on a complexity of values which help to give the original physical image its greater power. The albatross of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner begins as part of the oceanic ambience, yet becomes a symbol of an evil system of values. In Carey’s Oscar and Lucinda, the symbolism of glass is developed slowly but surely from its first introduction as the mysterious object in Lucinda’s hand. It is both the plain object of manufacture, and the metaphysical medium of the church which is the apex of aspirations in the novel. Through the work the symbol becomes an element much more important than it originally seemed, and a unifying element in a long and complex narrative. \n Symbols differ from metaphors in being much less closely tied to the specifics of language for their effect.

In data from the BNC sync outnumbers synch by 2:1, and in CCAE it’s closer to 4:1. The spelling of synch might seem to rhyme with “winch” or to be a mistake for “cinch.” At any rate sync works fine until you want it as a verb with the standard verb suffixes attached. Then the regular forms synced and syncing don’t seem ideal in terms of the spelling rule by which a c is normally softened to “s” by a following e or i. The conventional way to avoid this is to add a k, as in trafficking (see further under -c/-ck-), though there’s no sign of syncked/syncking in the databases. Instead synched/synching appear in both British and American data, and in the BNC they are the only spelling. In CCAE there’s some use of synced alongside synched (in the ratio 1:3); and syncing is on a par with synching, especially in lip-syncing – where the first element helps to identify the compound.

The second can be illustrated by the use of Washington to refer to the American federal government which has its headquarters there.

		"title": "synonyms",
		"explanation":"“Words with the same meaning” is a common definition of synonyms. But when you ask whether chair and seat, or tap and faucet, or buy and purchase are synonyms, clearly there’s more to be said. Words embody many kinds of meaning: denotative, connotative and stylistic; and relatively few words match up on all those dimensions. The denotation of chair is more specific than seat. (A chair has legs and can be moved around independently, whereas a seat at the opera is different on both counts.) The connotations of faucet make it North American, whereas tap is at home in Britain and Australia. The stylistic overtones of purchase are much more formal than those of buy. Few pairs of words like those are perfect synonyms. \n Yet words which diverge more than any of those can function as synonyms for each other. So high can stand for secondary when referring to schooling, even though it could never do so in secondary symptom. The fact that you can interchange them in one particular phrase without changing the meaning makes them synonyms there, for the purposes of the argument.

		"explanation":"This term is often used in alternation with grammar when talking about the structure of English. The two are however distinct when one gets down to details. Grammar is the broader term, embracing: \n 1 syntax (i.e. the grammatical relations between words as they’re strung together in phrases, clauses and sentences) \n  2 morphology (i.e. the grammar of words as shown by their suffixes and inflections) \n Because there are relatively few inflections in modern English, syntax is much more important in our grammar, in the broader sense... \n Syntax embodies the principles that underlie the syntagmatic axis of any language. This is the so-called “horizontal” dimension of meaning, vested in the order of words, and the way that adjacent words set up expectations about each other’s roles. We become most conscious of this axis of meaning when it’s unclear, as in the following headline: \n CLEANER TRAINS IN TEN YEARS \n If we take the first word as a noun, it becomes the subject of the verb we anticipate in “trains” – and we get a vision of the most thoroughly trained cleaner in the universe. Yet if we read the first word as a comparative adjective, we anticipate that the second word is the noun it describes – and it paints a gloomy picture of rail car maintenance. \n ♦ Compare the paradigmatic axis, under paradigm."

In medicine systemic diseases or drugs are those that affect the whole body; whereas in political and social science, problems such as systemic discrimination are built into the system itself.

		"title": "-t",
		"explanation":"Several sets of words with t as their final letter raise questions of spelling: \n 1 Two-syllable English words ending in -t: should it be doubled before inflections such as -ed and -ing? The question comes up with words like budget and many others, including: \n ballot banquet billet blanket \n bracket buffet bullet cosset \n debit docket ferret fidget \n fillet jacket junket limit \n market orbit picket plummet \n profit rivet rocket target \n ticket trumpet \n In all of them the syllable ending in -t is unstressed, and so the -t remains single before inflections, as in debited, marketing, profited, targeting etc. (see further under doubling of final consonant). These uncluttered spellings help to preserve the identity of the underlying noun, while their transfers into the role of verb or adjective are marked by inflections, as in budgeting for a surplus / a budgeted surplus (see transfers). The same principle of not doubling the -t applies to three-syllabled words such as benefit and deposit, when they become verbs. (See individual entry on benefit.) \n Yet there are exceptions among compound nouns used as verbs, e.g. input/output, and others, e.g. format, whose second element (mat) seems to be separable. It then dictates the spelling, and so the -t is doubled (formatting, inputted/outputted), according to the rule for doubling the final consonant of a monosyllable. \n ♦ For the spelling of bayonet and combat when inflected, see bayonet and combated or combatted. \n 2 French loanwords ending inasilent -t: what happens when they serve as verbs? Words to which this question applies include: \n ballet beret bouquet buffet \n cabaret chalet crochet debut \n depot parquet sachet valet \n The final -t remains silent even when the standard English verb suffixes are added, as in bouqueted, debuting, valeted. Their spelling is thus very straightforward, though the relationship between spelling and sound is quite unconventional for English. The verb ricochet is a special case, with two pronunciations and two sets of spellings (see ricochet). \n 3 Monosyllabic English verbs whose past ends in -t: when is it standard? The -t suffix is the standard past form for English verbs like the following: \n build (built) buy (bought) creep (crept) \n deal (dealt) keep (kept) leave (left) \n mean (meant) send (sent) sleep (slept) \n teach (taught) \n For other verbs the -t is an alternative to -ed, as with: \n burn dream kneel lean leap \n learn smell spell spill spoil \n Regional differences provide a backdrop for the choice of -t or -ed.

		"title": "tabbouleh, tabouleh or tabouli",
		"explanation":"These spellings, and other permutations and combinations like them, are used to refer to a Lebanese salad made of cracked wheat, parsley and tomato. The word is a recent borrowing (1955) from Arabic, where it appears as tabbula, apparently a derivative of tabil (“spice”). The Oxford Dictionary (1989) registers the word as tabbouleh but notes the alternative spellings tabbouli and tabbuuli, while tabouleh is the one spelling to be found in the BNC. Clearly there are several points of variability, although tabbouleh is the only spelling indicated in New Oxford (1998) and the Canadian Oxford (1998). Merriam-Webster (2000) also makes tabbouleh the standard spelling, but registers both tabouleh and tabouli in crossreferences. All three appear in CCAE data, though tabbouleh and tabouleh, in the ratio of 2:1, are much better represented than tabouli. In the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997) tabouli is prioritized as the preferred spelling.

Tables allow the reader to make instant comparisons horizontally and vertically, and to see overall trends. They are (or should be) designed to be read independently of the surrounding text, and must contain all the information necessary for that reading. \n Every table needs an explanatory title, highlighting its topic or the general trends which it shows. The wording must be specific enough to allow browsing readers to make sense of the figures, and may therefore run to two or three lines. Beneath the title comes the box containing the column headings for the table, showing what kind of entries are entered in the field or body of the table, and what unit of measurement they’re calibrated in. Abbreviations can be freely used in column headings. \n Numerical issues in designing tables: the unit of measurement should be chosen so as to minimize excess zeros, or zeros that are nonsignificant in the figures cited. (So 59 kg is preferable to 59 000 gm.) The whole set of figures must be expressed in terms of the same unit for easy comparison. If percentages are used, readers also need to know the actual size of the population analyzed, and the raw number (n= whatever) should be given in the footnotes to the table. \n Tables these days work with a minimum of horizontal rules drawn in, and no vertical rules, to allow the eye to move freely across and down. \n The side headings in a table, known collectively as the stub, are set flush with the margin, as is the numbering in the illustrative table. Turnover lines may be indented if there’s sufficient space, or else set flush left with a line space between each heading. The headings begin with a capital letter, but have no final full stops. The wording of all headings needs to be made consistent. In the example, all headings begin with an imperative form of the verb. See further under lists."

In current English they typically involve private subjects such as defecation (shit), urination (piss) and copulation (fuck): see further under four-letter words. \n Earlier on in English, taboo words linked up with religion, as they still do in other languages. Religion is often a focus of taboos, because religious words uttered without reverence are naturally an offense to those who take religion seriously. Some of our common expletives are disguised religious references: by Crikey is a veiled form of “by Christ”; and bloody is believed to be a disguised form of “by our Lady.” In those forms they are less directly blasphemous, and do not seem to violate religious taboos – though bloody can still be offensive to some as a swear word (see further under that heading). \n  The force of taboo words is that they evoke the taboo subject in a blatant or blasphemous way. Disguised expletives serve to reduce the problem in speech, and latinate words like those mentioned above help writers to deal with taboo subjects when necessary. \n The word taboo is an English respelling of the Tongan word tabu (“forbidden”), though tabu itself is occasionally used as the spelling.

The idiom of achieving a target makes it clear that target often means “objective,” and this broader sense is now registered in both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000).

It belonged to John Macadam, the originator and advocate of the road-making technique, who was made surveyor-general of British (metropolitan) roads in 1827. The unabbreviated noun tarmacadam is now much less common than tarmac in BNC data, and the verb tarmac(ked) seems to have ushered out the older verb macadamize(d) since the 1960s. Inflected forms of the verb are usually spelled with the additional k,as recommended by New Oxford (1998), and in keeping with the usual rule for words ending in c.

Both technology and technological have a learned ring to them, and institutes of technology can offer university-style degrees, while technical colleges do not. \n Differences like those are matched in the words technologist and technician.

Technical writers do however need to be able to adjust their style, if they have any ambitions to communicate with the public, let alone win them over.

		"title": "tele-",
		"explanation":"These letters represent two Greek prefixes, one in common usage, the other mostly confined to philosophy. \n 1 The very familiar prefix tele- means “distant” or “over a distance.” It derives from telescope, first recorded in English in C17 along with new developments in optics. Other tele- words are monuments to technological developments, including telegraph (1794), telephone (1835), telemeter (1860) and television (1909). In both television and telecommunication, the Greek prefix forms a linguistic hybrid with a Latin word; and it now combines with ordinary English words in teleprinter, teletext, teletype. \n Some other simple formations with tele- are really blends of television and other words: \n telecast telemovie teleplay \n teleprompter televiewer \n (see further under portmanteau words). \n 2 The much less common prefix tele- or teleo- means “end or goal.” Best known in the philosophical term teleology, it refers to the theoretical approach which looks for evidence of design in nature, and for the ultimate purpose in any phenomenon."

Tempera is an Italian word for a method of mixing paint, combining the pigments with egg yolk. It was once known as distemper, but that word has been annexed by home decorators to refer to paints which are made with sizing materials less expensive than eggs. A new word had to be found for the original egg-based technique of fine art, and tempera has been used in English for this since 1832. \n Tempura is a Japanese word meaning “fried food.” It refers to a dish in which seafood or vegetables are deep-fried in a very light batter, again making good use of egg yolk."

		"explanation":"Templet is the original spelling of this word for a pattern or mould used to reproduce a design on another surface or in another medium. The word comes from Latin templum (“timber, beam”) via French (where a diminutive ending -et(te) was added on), and so templet meant “small timber.” This background was obscure to English users, and the C19 spelling template injects some sense into the second syllable, helping it to displace templet entirely. It is however a folk etmology: see further under that heading."

		"title": "temporary or temporal",
		"explanation":"The time in temporary is always limited, and sometimes very brief: a temporary appointment, a temporary shelter from the storm. The pressure of time seems to be felt in the word itself, at least in British English, so that it’s commonly pronounced with only three syllables (and sometimes only two – which occasionally registers as the spelling “tempory” in unedited writing). American pronunciation preserves the four syllables with a secondary stress, and helps writers to produce the standard spelling. \n Temporal relates to time at large. In academic fields such as linguistics it means “expressing a time factor,” as in temporal conjunction. In religion it expresses finite human time, in contrast with eternal, spiritual time. So the Lords Temporal (in the English House of Lords) have a lesser brief than the Lords Spiritual. \n The adverb temporarily (like temporary) suffers from an overdose of weak syllables in British pronunciation and is sometimes short-circuited so that it sounds like “temporally,” exactly like the regular adverb associated with temporal, as in culturally and temporally specific. It sometimes shows in transcriptions of speech, as in: He went temporally insane.

		"title": "than",
		"explanation":"Questions about the grammar of than were energetically debated in C18, and still today are sometimes asked. By origin it is a subordinating conjunction, used to introduce comparative clauses, as in: \n He knows more than I do about the family history. \n The use of the subject pronoun I anticipates the verb (do), and confirms that a clause is to follow. This is proof that than is indeed a conjunction – in that sentence. But older commentators were inclined to think, “once a conjunction, always a conjunction,” and to disregard common constructions like the following: \n He knows more than me about the family history. \n In that alternative version of the sentence, the object pronoun me shows than operating as a preposition, which normally takes an object. Prepositional use of than with an object pronoun has been recorded since C16, yet prescriptive grammarians still argue that the subject pronoun is the proper one to use after it; and they would “correct” the second sentence to: \n He knows more than I about the family history. \n To many people this sounds less natural, but its proponents argue that it is an elliptical version of the first sentence above, i.e. that a whole clause is to be understood after than, and so I is the correct pronoun. Yet there’s no need for this elaborate argument if we allow that than is both a preposition and a subordinator. Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) showed that speakers mostly use than (and as) as prepositions (i.e. with a following object pronoun) and only rarely with a following subject pronoun. Fiction writers make about equal use of the two constructions, while academic writers use neither. Academic comparisons more often turn on correlative phrases with comparative adjectives: \n He possessed a greater sense of history than others of his time. \n You could therefore say that the problem is academic! It rarely comes up in academic prose, and in fiction and conversation where than is much more often used with simple pronouns, the use of object forms is quite idiomatic. In practice the issue only arises with first or third person pronouns that have distinct forms for the subject and object (I, we, he, she, they). For the second person pronoun you, the third person it, it makes no difference – or for nouns and proper names: He knows more than John (does) about the family history. \n A different issue with than is its potential ambiguity when used elliptically, as in: \n She’s kinder to her dog than the children. \n To settle the ambiguity in sentences like that, the point needs to be spelled out more fully. (See further under ellipsis.) \n Combinations with than: \n 1 Than and what. The most extended use of than as a preposition is to be seen in nonstandard usage such as: He wanted it more than what I did. \n Such constructions provide an empty object for than but ensure the use of the subject pronoun in the following clause. It could thus be seen as a kind of hypercorrective response to the grammatical “problem” (see hypercorrection). The what is unnecessary because the sentence could perfectly well be: He wanted it more than I did (or more than me). The construction than what is associated with impromptu talk – one of the various redundancies that occur when we construct sentences on the run, which need to be edited out of written documents. \n 2 Following than it’s possible to use either an infinitive or an -ing form of the verb. Compare: \n She rushed on rather than let us catch up. \n She was rushing on rather than letting us catch up. \n But as these examples show, the choice can effectively be made by matching the forms before and after than: the -ing follows a continuous/progressive form of the main verb, while the infinitive goes with other aspects and tenses. \n 3 Than with quasi-comparatives. A number of adjectives and adverbs imply comparisons without having the standard comparative suffixes such as -er or more. They include collocations like different/differently than (and superior than) which are used especially in speech as alternatives to constructions with from or to. Other constructions which sometimes use than are sequences such as hardly . . . than, scarcely . . . than, where the alternative is to use when as the subordinator. Purists are inclined to argue that than has no place in such phrases, because the comparison remains implicit rather than explicit in the form of words. Yet common idiom endorses such combinations. See further under different from, hardly and scarcely."

		"explanation":"These expressions differ a little in style. Thank you is the standard and neutral way of expressing one’s gratitude: \n Thank you for your attention. \n Thanks is more informal, and works either as a friendly acknowledgement or a brisk refusal: \n Thanks for being with us. \n No thanks. I’ve had enough. \n The expression many thanks gets the best of both worlds. It embodies warmer feeling than thank you, while avoiding the informality of thanks. \n Note that when thank you becomes a compound noun or adjective, it is either set solid or hyphenated, as in said their thankyous and wrote a thank(-)you note."

The role of thankfully as a “sentence adverb” is thus established in British English, and recognized also in American by Merriam-Webster (2000). Objections to disjunctive use of thankfully – like those against hopefully – are difficult to justify on grounds of grammar or usage. \n ♦ Compare hopefully."

		"title": "that",
		"explanation":"The workhorse of the English language, that has uses as a demonstrative pronoun and determiner, as a relative pronoun, two kinds of conjunction, and occasionally as an adverb. \n 1 As a demonstrative, that complements this. That represents something further away than whatever we might apply this to: This goes with that as they say in a certain fashion store. That draws attention to something at a remove from the reader and writer, whereas this draws them together over it. Yet in conversation that often refers to something in the physical context, and is very much more common than this – by a factor of more than 7:1 in the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus. In writing that must have an antecedent (phrase or clause) to refer to in the text itself: \n To go to Japan – that was her number one ambition. \n The examples so far have shown that as a pronoun, whereas in that trip and that exciting trip it serves as a determiner (not “adjective,” as in traditional grammar and older dictionaries). As determiner or pronoun, that is a useful cohesive device, like the personal pronouns. (See further under coherence or cohesion.) \n 2 That as a clause-connector. That serves to link embedded, complementary and subordinate clauses to the main clause in one of three ways: \n ∗ as a relative pronoun (like which, who) \n ∗ introducing a noun (complement) clause \n ∗ introducing an adverbial clause \n These three uses of that are detailed in sections (a), (b) and (c) below. That also appears in several compound subordinating conjunctions: \n in order that, provided that, so that  \n a) When that introduces a relative clause it can be omitted – and often is, depending on both grammatical and stylistic factors. It often disappears when it’s the object of the relative clause, as in: \n The TV program (that) we saw last night had a powerful impact on us. \n Compare the obligatory use of that in: \n A TV program that had a powerful impact on us was shown last night. \n In the second sentence that is the subject of the relative clause and must be expressed in current written English. Yet the deletion of that as object pronoun is normal in conversation, and these days common in writing (see relative clauses section 1). \n ♦ For the choice between that and which, and their use in restrictive relative clauses, see relative pronouns. \n b) When that prefaces a noun (complement) clause (also called a content clause), it’s often omitted after verbs expressing a mental or verbal process: \n We knew (that) the idea was yours. \n He thought (that) he said it. \n Constructions like these, with that omitted, abound in everyday discourse. They serve to express the speaker’s stance or that of others, and are equally useful and common in fiction writing, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. The omission of that very often happens when a personal pronoun is the subject of the following clause, and especially when it refers back to the subject of the main clause, as in the second example above. But in academic style, when the clause complements an abstract noun for a mental or verbal construct, e.g. assumption, belief, doubt, suggestion, that is normally expressed. For example: \n Doubts that the government would fund the project . . . quickly surfaced \n The suggestion that younger people were included was quickly . . . \n The divergent patterns of speech / fictional writing and more formal written English would explain why the omission of that from complement clauses is often thought of as “informal,” though it’s really a matter of different constructions. \n c) In various kinds of adverbial clauses, that is also omitted, depending on the formality of style. This is expecially true when it functions as part of a compound conjunction, for example: \n We were so exhausted (that) we didn’t care. \n They would be there provided (that) we did all the catering. \n The constructions without that present the briskness of speech, rather than the decorum of formal writing. \n 3 That as an adverb. Some adverbial uses of that are more or less standard English, as when it serves as an intensifier of other adverbs, in nonassertive contexts (Comprehensive Grammar, 1985). \n Is it that far to Kharkiv? \n The course isn’t that easy. \n Apart from its use in negative and interrogative constructions, that serves occasionally as a modifier of much: \n It should be that much easier to do. \n But the use of that as an intensifier of adjectives is still quite colloquial: \n They were that excited about the trip to Germany. \n The standard intensifying word for modifying adjectives is so.

		"title": "the",
		"explanation":"This common and humble word is surprisingly significant in conveying ideas. In traditional grammar it was the definite article in a class of its own, though contemporary grammars now class it as one of the determiners. Its major roles are outlined below, as well as issues of its use in journalism and when citing proper names. \n 1 Cohesive the. In the grammar of English, the has the very important role of signaling that a noun is to follow. It very often implies that the noun is one with which readers are already acquainted, as in: \n The result was not declared immediately. \n Effectively the says, “You know which one I mean,” and reminds us of an earlier reference to the same thing in the text. Thus it’s an important cohesive device (see further under coherence or cohesion). The often links up with a phrase introduced by an indefinite article (a or an). Yet the makes connections with all kinds of noun phrases, and can forge a link with a whole clause or sentence, as in: He asked if we would cover the costs. \n The answer from my boss was predictable . . . \n 2 Universal and generic uses of the. The use of the sometimes appeals to common knowledge outside the text, rather than working cohesively with other words and phrases within it. Examples like the government, the radio call on our social and cultural experience, and the sun, the world on what we know of the universe. Common knowledge is also invoked in the so-called “generic” use of the with a singular noun: \n A conservation program for the white rhino is now in place. \n In the one-teacher school, older students act as mentors to younger ones. \n We assume that these sentences are about rhinos and one-teacher schools in the plural, despite the singular construction with the. \n 3 Journalistic omission of the. In everyday news reporting journalists often delete the when providing readers with a thumbnail identity of the person just mentioned in the report: \n Peter Carey, (the) author of Oscar and Lucinda and ex-advertising man has a gift for graphic description. \n As an appositional structure, this is grammatically straightforward. But the practice is sometimes applied before mentioning the person’s name: \n Novelist and ex-advertising man Peter Carey has a gift for . . . \n This gives the person a “pseudo-title” (Meyer, 2002), a style which is well established in American news reporting but resisted in other quarters of the English-speaking world. It is strongly associated with journalese (see further under journalism). \n There is of course no problem in omitting the when it refers to a unique office: \n As coach, he was a tireless motivator. \n He was voted co-president for a second year. \n Omission of the under these circumstances is acceptable in any writing style. \n 4 Issues involving the within proper names. \n *The in geographical names. The English form of certain placenames has included the word the, which may or may not still be capitalized. The Dutch city of The Hague is one case where the official name includes the definite article, with a capital letter even in mid-sentence. Data from the BNC has it written that way in a large majority of instances (about 75%). The Dutch kingdom was once The Netherlands, though the official English form of the name is now just Netherlands, as shown in the United Nations members list (www.un.org). Yet most BNC texts (about 70%) have it as the Netherlands, as in Queen of the Netherlands, suggesting that the word the remains idiomatic, for the moment. With Lebanon, things have moved further, and only a minority of BNC writers make it the Lebanon (translating the French Le Liban). Most simply call it Lebanon. Informal designations such as the Trossachs and the Grand Tetons always have the written in lower-case (in mid-sentence). \n *The in titles of books, newspapers and magazines. The titles of many publications include the, witness Michael Ondaatje’s novel The English Patient and reference books such as The Gentle Art of Flavoring. In such cases, The needs a capital, as an intrinsic part of the title, even when cited in mid-sentence: \n Ondaatje’s novel The English Patient became an Oscar-winning movie. \n However style guides agree that if retaining the The makes an awkward sentence, it can be dropped: \n Have you read his Gentle Art of Flavoring? \n Likewise it’s accepted that when referring to titles prefaced by Aor An (e.g. A New English Dictionary), the indefinite article may be replaced by the. It would not be capitalized as part of the title: \n Information on many a cultural question can be found among the words listed in the New English Dictionary \n In the mastheads of newspapers and magazines, The no longer needs to be cited. Earlier style guides used to recommend it, perhaps because The Times and The Economist were known to insist on it. But the preferences of less well-known publications could be hard to ascertain, and so the simple practice of leaving The out makes a reliable rule for all. Some publications such as New Scientist have deliberately shed The from their mastheads, lest there be any doubt about it. The practice also simplifies adjectival use of such titles, as in: \n They have a collection of 100 Times editorials. \n The use of italics for newspaper titles is discussed at italic(s) section 5."

Themself was in fact standard English until mid-C16, when it was replaced by themselves. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) still treats it as obsolete, yet there are fresh British citations for it in a score of BNC sources, as well as American ones in CCAE. For example: \n How can someone hang themself?  \n . . . the person involved may justify themself \n somebody starts talking to themself \n a candidate who just talks about themself \n The singular reference in themself obviously serves a purpose, especially after an indefinite noun or pronoun. If we allow the use of they/them/their for referring to the singular (see they), themself seems more consistent than themselves. We make use of yourself alongside yourselves in just the same way. Themself has the additional advantage of being gender-free, and thus preferable to both himself and himself/herself. It’s time to reinstate it to the set of reflexive pronouns! \n The alternatives theirselves and theirself are registered in both Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Webster’s Third (1986), as nonstandard items. They are of course consistent in their makeup with myself, ourselves, yourself, yourselves in using a possessive adjective for the first element – whereas themself and themselves match up with himself and itself in using the object pronoun. The two sets provide conflicting analogies, but with the second set at least the third person reflexives are all consistent with each other."

		"title": "there",
		"explanation":"In the same sentence there can play two different grammatical parts: \n There were more people there than you’d expect. \n Without any particular thought we decode the first there in its “existential” role of indicating a topic, and the second as demonstrative adverb. Both are multi-faceted. \n 1 As a demonstrative adverb, there means “in/on/at/towards that place.” In speech as well as writing, it’s used to refer to a place already mentioned, whether geographical or abstract: \n We went there on foot. \n Turn to the diagram on p.10 and look at the details there. \n The lecture moved to government policy on the environment, and there he became very strident. \n There sometimes occurs at the start of a sentence, as in: \n There we found the start of the waterfall. \n Whatever its position in the sentence, there is cohesive with something said in a previous sentence. It binds conversational utterances together, and occurs much more often in speech than any kind of writing, according to the Longman Grammar (1999). \n Adverbial there combines with other adverbs/prepositions to form complex adverbs of place: \n  down there, over there, up there \n Note that from there is now used instead of thence (see further under hence); and that there itself has taken over from thither. \n ♦ Compare the legal adverbs compounded with there in first place, discussed at thereafter. \n 2 Existential there is the grammarians’ name for the there which introduces a topic, as in: \n There is no place like home. \n There are no winners in this situation. \n This use of there is very conspicuous, often at the start of a sentence, yet semantically empty – just a grammatical slot-filler to provide the subject for a significant complement (see predicate section 1c). Some grammarians therefore call it a “dummy subject,” like the “ambient it” in It was raining. This similarity explains why some older dictionaries label existential there as a “pronoun.” But unlike normal pronouns, it’s not a substitute for a previously mentioned word, and not at all cohesive like adverbial there. It is freely used in writing of all kinds as well as speech, according to the Longman Grammar, though frequently contracted to there’s in speech: see further in section 3 below. \n Existential there is almost always coupled with the verb be in the Longman Grammar corpus: in 99% of cases in spoken data, and 95% in fiction and academic prose. Just occasionally it combines with exist (in academic writing), and with longer paraphrases of be, such as seem/appear/used to. In fiction a sprinkling of other verbs combine with existential there to set the scene: \n On the bed there lay a small figure. \n There remained the small matter of money. \n There comes lends itself to various idioms such as: \n There comes a time when even a politician prefers early bed. \n There comes a point where one begins to suspect . . . \n Inversion of the normal subject–verb word order underscores the significance of the moment being described. (See further under inversion.) \n 3 There’s. Existential there can be contracted with is, as often happens in everyday discourse. It appears in writing, but much more often in fiction than other kinds of prose (Kjellmer, 1998): in almost 45% of all possible instances. There’s is however increasingly seen on the pages of the newspaper. WestergrenAxelsson (1998) found it in 15% of possible instances in journalism of the 1990s, though there’s is still much less common than other contractions such as it’s and that’s. \n Existential there couples with either singular or plural verbs (there is / there are, according to the following noun phrase), as shown at the beginning of section 2. This formal agreement is strictly maintained in academic writing. But in narrative and everyday writing, there is and especially there’s is found even with plural nouns. \n There’s tears in her eyes. \n There’s certain ways of getting round it. \n There’s lots of new plays being written. \n In conversation the combination of there’s with a plural noun is in fact more common than there are, according to the Longman Grammar. It goes especially with quantitative statements, indefinite and definite: \n There’s lots of questions to be answered. \n There’s enough people to tackle the problem.  \n . . . the lectures. There’s six of them. \n There’s four bedrooms. \n Negative statements also seem to attract there’s, as in: \n There’s no telephones with outside lines. \n There’s precedes collective phrases using a set/handful/crowd etc. with a following plural noun: \n There’s a whole crowd of protesters on the steps. \n When a compound subject follows, there’s rather than there are is selected: \n There’s a post office and a small church on the corner. \n In such cases both formal and proximity agreement help to select the singular verb (see further under agreement sections 3, 4 and 5). \n These various uses of there’s with plural (or notionally plural) noun phrases show how the structure is working its way into the standard. It seems to be evolving into a fixed phrase, rather like the French C’est . . . , serving the needs of the ongoing discourse rather than the grammar of the sentence."

The only one which enjoys some general use is thereby: \n She was known to lace claret with malt whisky, thereby ruining both drinks. \n In modern English therefor has become archaic as a way of saying “for that purpose” (except in law).

		"title": "therefore",
		"explanation":"No-one doubts that therefore is an adverb meaning “consequently” or “for that reason.” The question is whether it can sometimes be a conjunction. It typically forges a logical link between the two parts of a sentence, as in: \n The weather deteriorated, and therefore they thought the trip was off. \n In sentences like that, therefore is a conjunct, not a full conjunction because the grammatical connection depends on and. But in everyday speech, the sentence might equally have been: \n The weather deteriorated, therefore they thought the trip was off. \n In speech there is of course no punctuation, but the comma there equates with a brief (mid-sentence) pause, and suggests that speakers do use therefore like an ordinary conjunction – an emphatic alternative to so. There’s no lack of examples in the more argumentative spoken texts of the BNC, as speakers draw out their reasoning. The famous I think therefore I am shows that this usage is not simply colloquial. But traditional grammarians and dictionary-makers are disinclined to recognize therefore as a conjunction, and editors working on the same principle would probably repunctuate the travel example with a semicolon: \n The weather deteriorated; therefore they thought the trip was off. \n It is a nice distinction – a single dot making the difference between formal and informal style, and maintaining the boundaries between grammatical classes. Yet it doesn’t do to make too much turn on a semicolon, as more and more documents are read via computer screens (see under digital style). One way or another, therefore is on the threshold of becoming a sentence connector, as noted by the Collins Dictionary (1998).

		"title": "they, them, their",
		"explanation":"When we need to refer back to something in the third person plural, the pronoun they/them/their serves the purpose. It also serves generic purposes, in statements which claim universal validity: They also serve who only stand and wait. “Universal” use of the third person plural pronoun is also the one found in statements like: \n Everyone has to consider their future. \n This of course is more contentious. Purists might say that it’s ungrammatical to use their after everyone, because one requires a singular pronoun. Many others would say that generic/universal their provides us with a gender-free pronoun, avoiding the exclusive his and the clumsy his/her. It avoids gratuitous sexism and gives the statement broadest reference. With determiners such as each, the same things apply: \n Each member of the group must be prepared to bring in samples of their work to discuss. \n Again the use of their following an indefinite noun phrase allows it to remain gender-free and inclusive. \n They/them/their are now freely used in agreement with singular indefinite pronouns and determiners, those with universal implications such as any(one), every(one), no(one), as well as each and some(one), whose reference is often more individual. For those listening or reading, it has become unremarkable – an element of common usage. In fact the Oxford Dictionary (1989) has it on record since C16, but its acceptance was preempted by C18 grammarians, whose anxieties about formal agreement were reiterated in C20 by Fowler (1926) and Gowers (1965). The singular use of they/them/their after everyone and other indefinites can now be explained as a kind of “notional agreement” (see under agreement). \n Current dictionaries register the singular use of they, them and their among its definitions, often with an explanatory usage note. New Oxford (1998) treats their acceptability after indefinite pronouns as given, and is willing to embrace the next stage (use with indefinite nouns) in dictionary definitions. Merriam-Webster (2000) takes both for granted. The Canadian Oxford (1998) plays down the objections against its spreading use, and underscores its usefulness in avoiding sexist language. Webster’s English Usage (1989) illustrates current uses of singular they/them/their following indefinite nouns and pronouns in various kinds of publication from the mass-circulating to the academic. Australian research by Eagleson (1995) finds singular use of they/them/their in a range of writing from advertising to professional publications and legislation. The Australian government Style Manual (2002) endorses it as “standard idiom in most contexts.” All this evidence from different quarters of the English-speaking world shows that singular use of they/them/their after indefinites is now well established in writing. \n Language historians would note that the trend towards using they for both plural and singular is exactly what happened with you some centuries ago (see you and ye). The trend is probably “irreversible” (Burchfield, 1996). Those who find it uncomfortable can take advantage of the various avoidance strategies mentioned under he and/or she, to be used when grammatical liberties with they/them/their are unthinkable. Yet that kind of response to singular they/them/their is no longer shared by the English-speaking population at large. Writers who use singular they/them/their are not at fault. \n International English selection: The appearance of singular they/them/their in many kinds of prose shows its acceptance by English writers generally. It recommends itself as a gender-free solution to the problem of agreement with indefinite pronouns and noun phrases."

The second was addressed to the crowd assembled to hear the sermon on the mount. In fact this biblical grammar was somewhat old-fashioned in its own day. \n Shakespeare’s plays suggest that by about 1600, the singular/plural distinction between thou and ye had already been replaced by a style distinction in which thou/thee was used for friendly and intimate address to an individual, while ye/you was for neutral, public and more distant address, to either an individual or a group. This is comparable to the distinction still made in French, German and other modern European languages. But for some reason the distinction was short-lived in English, and by the end of C17 thou/thee had been replaced by you for almost all second person uses, both singular and plural. Thou/thee survive in everyday use in some British rural dialects, and among Quakers. Otherwise, they are now the hallmark of religious language, as a special form of address to the divinity: \n Praise be to thee, O God. \n And of literary rhetoric: \n O wild west wind, thou breath of autumn’s being. . . \n The lofty overtones of thou/thee contrast now with its humble origins."

If it seems more formal than though, that goes with it being the commoner of the two in academic prose by a factor of 3:1, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. In fiction the reverse is true: instances of though outnumber those of although by 3:1. \n Though has other roles than that of concessive subordinator which it shares with although. It also serves as a contrastive subordinator (like “but”), as in: \n He was reserving judgement, though he considered it a hopeful sign. \n It works as a contrastive adverb, meaning “however,” at any point in a sentence including the end: \n I wouldn’t stake my life on it, though. \n As in that example, though often serves to link an utterance with one that preceded it. This is indeed its major role in conversation, for both British and American speakers, according to the Longman Grammar. It would explain why the Canadian Oxford (1998) deems adverbial use of though to be “informal.” Nevertheless it’s registered without any stylistic judgement in New Oxford (1998), Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). Adverbial uses of though are also found in the Longman corpus of fiction and British/American news reporting, though they are rare in academic prose. \n Other conjunctive roles of though (but not although) are to combine with as and even in compound conjunctions: \n As though it had been commissioned, the sun began to shine. \n Even though we were indoors, the mosquitos found us out. \n Even though is more emphatic than although or though, and draws extra attention to a concessive statement when it’s needed. \n Both though and although have alternative spellings in tho’/tho and altho’/altho. Unlike many abbreviations, they have no effect on the pronunciation of the word, and they do tidy up the surplus letters. Despite this, neither abbreviation has caught on generally. Most of those in BNC data were in transcribed speech rather than published texts, and those in CCAE appeared in direct reporting of newsworthy statements. Webster’s English Usage (1989) finds tho only in advertising and certain technical journals. The forms with the apostrophe declare their informality, and those without it are perhaps too different from the regular spelling. Eminently sensible as they are, tho’/tho and altho’/altho remain beyond the pale of standard English. \n ♦ For other examples of trimmed spelling, see spelling section 5."

		"title": "thrash and thresh",
		"explanation":"Both thrash and thresh come from the same source word “thresshe,” the variant spelling with an a making its appearance first in C16. The different spellings have since linked up with different strands of meaning: thrash with the verb “beat” and thresh with “separate the grains of wheat from the stalks.” The divorce is not total, in that there are occasional examples of thresh in both British and American databases which do not relate to harvesting, as in the thresh of his emotions and a threshing mass of children. By the same token, there are no examples of thrash/thrashing that refer to harvesting. That apart, it’s thrash that’s gaining ground as the one used for newer figurative meanings, in the thrash metal band, thrashed his opponent, thrashing out an agreement."

		"title": "through and thru",
		"explanation":"With the meaning “from one end to another,” this word can be used in the dimensions of either space or time. Compare: \n They walked through the park. \n They walked through the night. \n In such cases, through governs a noun which is a unit of space or time. \n A slightly different temporal use of through has developed in American English, by which it links two words specifying the beginning and the end of a time period: \n The gallery will be open Monday through Thursday \n Here through means “from Monday up to and including Thursday” – though it’s a neater way of saying it, and it has the advantage of making it clear that the period runs until the end of Thursday. The alternative expression Monday to Thursday leaves it not entirely clear whether the period includes the whole of Thursday. The use of through to define a period or time is now widely recognized and understood outside North America. Yet there’s scant evidence of its actual use in BNC texts, hence the restrictive label “North American” in New Oxford (1998) and “US” in the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n The abbreviated spelling thru is not generally used in documentary writing, even though it appears on street signs (NO THRU ROAD), and in catalogues and advertising. In American English it also appears in newspaper headlines: BROADWAY THRU A KEYHOLE, in data from CCAE, and in entertainment schedules, as in showing Tuesday thru Friday. Canadians too use it this way (Canadian English Usage, 1997). Thru renders the word simply and directly, and has everything to recommend it. Major American institutions such as the National Education Association and the Chicago Tribune tried to establish it, among others, during nearly a century of spelling reform. (See further under gh.) Compounds such as thruway and drive-thru are isolated monuments to the endeavor, but thru still lacks broad acceptance in its own right. In BNC data it appears only in computing notes and a few transcriptions of speech. \n ♦ For other trimmed spellings, see spelling section 5."

		"title": "throwaway terms",
		"explanation":"Because languages reflect the culture of the people who use them, they also show something of their values and attitudes to others – those they admire and those for whom they have no respect. Every language has expressions like the English Chinese copy, Dutch courage, French leave, which enshrine stereotyped criticism of the peoples concerned. \n Throwaway expressions have no factual basis, though they sometimes emerge in a century when relations with another country are particularly vexed. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes that rivalry between the English and the Dutch in C17 seems to have generated various phrases critical of the Dutch, including Dutch bargain, Dutch gold, Dutch treat, Dutch uncle. The phrases imply stereotypes of the Dutch as stingy and moralizing. Throwaway terms for the French tend to project them as licentious, witness French kiss, French letter, doing french. Speakers of languages other than English return the compliment. To express what the English call French leave, there are expressions in Italian, French and Norwegian which translate as “leave like an Englishman.” \n The prejudices and stereotypes embodied in throwaway terms are very persistent, and it would be better for neighborly relations if they passed into oblivion. Dictionaries too can do their bit by removing the capital letter from throwaway terms, so that there’s no subconscious stimulus to read them as national or geographical terms. The fact that French Guiana comes just before French leave in the headword list is no reason to insist on keeping the capital letter on the second."

This is why thus sometimes comes to be used as a conjunction in argumentative speech: \n . . . the government’s agenda is to abolish state pension, thus more and more people will rely on private and company pension. \n In that example from transcribed speech in the BNC, thus introduces a finite clause like an ordinary conjunction. Much more often it’s followed by a nonfinite clause, and remains a conjunct as in: \n . . . reduce the cost of subscriptions thus encouraging trade union membership. \n The role of conjunction is less far advanced for thus than for other conjuncts such as therefore and however.

Until is however very much more common in current English, outnumbering till by about 8:1 in BNC data and more than 30:1 in data from CCAE. Both words can be used as prepositions and conjunctions, in the dimensions of time and space. Note that neither till nor until needs to be combined with up. “Up till” and “up until” are both tautologies, though sometimes used for special emphasis. \n The form ’til explains itself as an abbreviation of until, but is strictly redundant when till stands in its own right, as we have seen. In data from the BNC and CCAE, ’til is used in quotations to suggest direct speech, as in “the game ain’t over ’til it’s over,” and in titles and slogans: shop-’til-you-drop.

		"explanation":"The titles of publications and creative works demand special treatment to set them apart from ordinary strings of words. This entry deals in turn with books, journal articles, newspapers and magazines and audiovisual media. (For the titles used by people, see under forms of address.) \n 1 Book titles are distinguished in print by italics, and in handwriting or typing by underlining. On the question of which words in the title to capitalize, all agree that the first word must carry a capital letter, but after that there’s considerable divergence from one journal or publishing house to the next. Opinions range from minimal use of capitals to something like maximal: \n a) capitalize nothing apart from any proper names: For the term of his natural life \n b) capitalize all nouns: For the Term of his natural Life \n c) capitalize all nouns and adjectives: For the Term of his Natural Life \n d) capitalize all nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs and adverbs (i.e. everything except function words): \n For the Term of His Natural Life \n Librarians and bibliographers work with minimal capitals, i.e. option (a), yet options (b) to (d) are well established in literary tradition. For many people there’s virtue in using option (a) in lists and bibliographies (see further under bibliographies), but using one of the other options for titles quoted in the course of a written discussion. Option (b) is quite sufficient whenever an italic typeface or underlining is used to set the title apart from the text in which it’s embedded. \n These options also allow us to contrast the title and subtitle of a book with heavier and lighter capitalization. Thus any of the options (b) to (d) can be used for the main title, and option (a) for the subtitle, as in: \n The Life and Times of the English Language: the marvelous history of the English tongue. \n The use of option (a) for the subtitle also settles a minor bone of contention over whether to capitalize its first word. There is no need. The principle of minimal capitals means lower case for everything (except proper names) in the subtitle, as shown above. \n 2 The use of short titles (an abbreviated form of the book’s title) is on the increase. They replace the Latin ibid. etc. in footnotes, and also appear in the main text in second and subsequent allusions to a publication. Within the text, it’s helpful to have more than minimal capitalization. (See further under short titles.) \n 3 Titles of journal articles. The setting of the titles of scholarly articles varies from journal to journal, reflecting the decisions and preferences of individual editors. A traditional style is to enclose the title of the article in quotation marks, and to use italics (or underlining) for the name of the journal itself. More recent style does away with quotation marks, and simply uses typography to contrast the title of the article (in roman) with the name of the journal (in italics). It avoids the problem of “quotes within quotes,” whose status is unclear – apart from their rather fussy appearance within quote-marked titles. Abbreviations for the stock items in journal references, such as J for Journal, are increasingly used, especially in the Vancouver style. (See bibliographies section C.) \n 4 Titles of newspapers and magazines. The mastheads of newspapers and magazines are set in italics, normally without The (see the section 4). The date of issue and the edition, where necessary, are given as well as the section number or name, if the paper is produced in separate units. Page references are optional according to both the Chicago Manual (1993) and Copy-editing (1992). \n 5 Titles of radio and TV programs, feature films, sound recordings etc. The titles of these are capitalized, as for books. Again it’s desirable to have more than minimal capitalization when the titles are cited in running text, using any of the options (b), (c) or (d) noted in section 1 above. Quotation marks are sometimes used to distinguish the subunits of a TV or radio series (as with individual poems in an anthology). Otherwise the titles of audiovisual items are distinguished chiefly by the use of italics (see further under italic[s]).

To is commonly thought of as an essential part of the infinitive of English verbs, but it’s not necessarily so. (For a discussion of the so-called “split infinitive,” as in to really understand, see split infinitive.) \n To often serves as the link between semi-auxiliaries or catenatives and the main verb, for example: \n be going to, dare to, had to, \n need to, ought to, begin to, \n like to, mean to, try to, \n want to \n Note that the to is sometimes omitted with dare, need, ought, especially in negative statements (see individual headings). \n ♦ For the choice between to (plus infinitive) and of (plus -ing) after verbs like begin, like, try, see under complementation. \n 2 To after certain adjectives. To has always been used after adjectives (and adverbs), especially those which suggest likeness or closeness, for example: \n adjacent to, close to, similar to, near to \n It also works with many kinds of words to suggest a particular orientation or relative position, as with: \n amenable to, averse to, comparable to, \n conducive to, different to, oblivious to, \n susceptible to \n For some of these, the collocation with to is an alternative, but for others it’s the only one used.

In writing, the French spelling helps to distance the word from the WC. No longer is it possible to say: She appeared in a blue toilet, as in C19; and the possibility of a toilet being a “reception held while dressing” (a C18 usage) is unthinkable.

		"title": "tolerance or toleration",

This is still so when it comes to religious toleration, which often suggests the need to accept other religions because of their presence in the community, rather than any desire to endorse them. These differences are neutralized in intolerance, which serves as the negative form for both tolerance and toleration."

		"title": "ton, tonne and tonnage",
		"explanation":"The word ton belongs to the imperial system of weights and measures (equivalent to 2240 lb). Extended terms such as gross ton or long ton help to distinguish it from the short ton of 2000 lb, which is used in the US. (The latter is therefore sometimes called the “American ton” by outsiders.) The tonne is a metric unit of mass equal to 1000 kg. \n Ton derives from tun, a word for a large cask of wine or beer, which has also served as a unit of measurement for liquids. The spelling ton was simply a variant of tun that became the word for a standard of weight during C17. Tonne was borrowed from French in C19, though it too is ultimately the same word. \n The word tonnage (“volume of freight”) originated with the imperial system, and dictionaries still tend to refer to the ton in defining it. But the word is quietly embracing the metric tonne. In current British usage tonnage is expressed as often in tonnes as tons, in BNC examples such as: \n . . . great ship with a gross tonnage of 80 000 tons Net tonnage of goods broke the four million tonne mark. \n When tonnages are specified like this there’s no doubt about what they amount to. Much of the time, tonnage is used abstractly as in the tonnage of raw potatoes processed or of bombs dropped, and it makes no difference whether readers think in terms of tons or tonnes."

		"title": "too",
		"explanation":"This diminutive adverb has two distinct roles, as an intensifier and as an additive marker, both linked to particular styles: \n ∗ as intensifier, too modifies adjectives or adverbs, as in It was too hot to hold or That’s going too far. In conversation too is commonly heard from both British and American speakers – whereas academic writers make little use of it, according to Longman Grammar (1999) research. \n ∗ as an additive adverb, too appears immediately after the item (word, phrase, clause) which is to be added to one mentioned before: My brother came, and his wife too. In this role it complements also, but where too is most common in speech and speech-like writing, also prevails very strongly in expository and academic writing, according to the Longman Grammar. In “private speech” it’s most likely to be positioned at the end of the sentence (Taglicht, 1984), whereas almost 60% of written examples followed the first sentence element, putting the spotlight on it: Russell too used that metaphor. On rare occasions too is the very first word. The original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) noted that this could no longer happen, but revoked the comment in its second edition (1989), with a fresh set of examples.

		"title": "topic",
		"explanation":"The beginning of a sentence is its most important “slot.” Whatever is there gets foregrounded for the reader as the ongoing focus of interest, whether it’s something talked about in the preceding sentence(s), or a new focus of attention. Compare: \n A) James Rand had always wanted to go to Africa. He had met Moroccans in Spain who seemed to exude the mystery of the dark continent. He also knew there was business to be cultivated in Nigeria, and he could amuse himself with a little big game hunting as recreation. . . \n B) James Rand had always wanted to go to Africa. But until things settled down in Nigeria, you wouldn’t look for business there. The big game hunting grounds of Africa were still an attraction. . . \n Notice how version (A) seems to focus on JR the man himself, whereas version (B) is concerned with locations. These different perspectives develop from the different openings to the second and third sentences. Both versions begin with a statement about the man and the place, but (A) turns the spotlight on “he” and (B) on “Nigeria” and other African places. Thus the focus of the passage, and what it foregrounds as a whole, is controlled by what appears at the beginnings of successive sentences. \n 1 Sentence positions. The all-important first slot in the sentence is often referred to as the topic. The rest of the sentence is then known as the comment. In these terms the first sentence above is structured thus: \n TOPIC: James Rand \n COMMENT: had always wanted to go to Africa \n The topic position can of course be occupied by different grammatical items. It’s often a name, pronoun or noun phrase which is the grammatical subject of the sentence. But it can also be an opening adverbial phrase or clause, as in sentence 2 of version (B): \n But until things settled down in Nigeria. . . \n The topic may be preceded by a conjunction/conjunct (in that case but), which helps to show that the focus is changing. In closely argued writing the topic is quite often preceded by a conjunct and/or an interpersonal cue such as perhaps, regrettably, which again helps to frame the topic item for the reader. \n What happens in the comment slot (the latter part of the sentence) is less important for information focus. It does however serve to introduce information which can be developed in the following sentence. The reference to “Africa” in the comment of the first sentence gives the writer a basis from which to develop the subject and to refer to “Moroccans” in the second sentence (version A) and “Nigeria” (version B). \n Note that some linguists replace the terms topic and comment with theme and rheme respectively. \n 2 Topicalizing phrases. Because the topic position is so important, what goes there should not be dictated by the routine grammar of the clause. Ordinarily a clause begins with its subject, as noted above; yet something else can be put ahead of it to highlight the point at issue. The phrase or clause which does that is known as a topicalizing phrase/clause. In documentary writing there are stock topicalizing phrases which serve to alter the focus: \n In a similar/later/larger study, researchers found that . . . \n From a historical/theoretical point of view, it seems that . . . \n For other examples, see under dangling participles. \n 3 Topicalizing with the passive. Another resource for getting something into topic position is using the passive – which puts the spotlight on the object of the verb instead of the subject. Compare: \n The Moroccans embodied all the mystery of the dark continent. \n All the mystery of the dark continent was embodied in the Moroccans. \n The first version sets the topic up as people, the second as an intriguing place. \n 4 Using a cleft sentence to establish the topic. Cleft sentences provide a more pointed way of indicating a topic. For example: \n It was the Moroccans who embodied all the mystery of the dark continent . . . \n It was the mystery of the dark continent that the Moroccans embodied . . . \n The cleft sentence can extract either the subject or object of an ordinary sentence as the focal topic. (See further under cleft sentences.) \n With these various strategies, writers can manage their focus of discussion within paragraphs and extended texts, purposefully maintaining or changing it. Other details of information management are discussed under information focus."

		"title": "torturous or tortuous",
		"explanation":"Though there’s torture in it, torturous is usually used metaphorically, as in sports training conducted at a torturous pace or music with torturous violin and vocals. The pain caused may be physical, but not usually life-threatening. Tortuous means “twisting, winding,” and so lends itself to the description of rough mountainous tracks: a tortuous climb across the cliff. By the same token, a walk across the glacier could be both tortuous and torturous, i.e. a difficult and grueling passage. \n Tortuous has figurative uses too, in describing verbal processes and negotiations, as in tortuous legal battles or the tortuous takeover of a motel chain. It sometimes describes language itself, as in a tortuous explanation or tortuous metaphors, with the sense of “convoluted.” Here torturous metaphors is also possible – if they were particularly excruciating! \n At any rate, figurative uses of torturous and tortuous converge in more than one place, when indicating physical stress for the athlete/performer, and mental stress for the observer. If negative stress is all that matters, either torturous or tortuous might do. Overall tortuous is the commoner of the two by far in database evidence, and may itself seem to connote some kind of torture, for many writers and readers. But if the cause of the stress is to be pinpointed, it’s probably better to use a synonym like one of those mentioned above."

		"title": "trademarks",
		"explanation":"When first created, trademarks and tradenames are jealously guarded commercial property, to be used only by the company that owns them. The shareholder may nevertheless rejoice to hear the product name becoming a household word. If your fortunes depend on HOOVER, it’s reassuring when people use hoover as a noun or verb to refer to any vacuum cleaner or to vacuum cleaning – as if it’s the only product of its kind on the market. It suggests that the word is becoming generic, and would merit a place in the dictionary. \n The point at which a word moves from being a tradename to being a generic word is in one sense a matter of law. Unpleasant lawsuits are fought over what is considered by one party to be a protected tradename, and by the other to be common lexical property. Dictionaries are sometimes invoked to show whether a word is generic, and can find themselves in the gun for including words which began life as tradenames. Their defense is to say that such words would not be in the list if they were not already generic, while noting that the word originated as a trademark. A surprising number of ordinary words began life as trademarks, including: \n aqualung biro cellophane crimplene \n dictaphone escalator jeep kleenex \n laundromat levis linotype masonite \n nylon plasticine polaroid primus \n pyrex rollerblade technicolor thermos \n vaseline velcro walkman xerox \n zipper \n There are many more. Unfortunately, dictionaries do not indicate the currency of any trademark mentioned, and a good many are out-of-date. \n Newspapers and mass-circulating magazines are more often challenged over the use of a tradename than dictionaries. They are vulnerable because they also contain advertising, and editorial use of tradenames may be seen as promoting one product at the expense of others. Most newspapers take no risks therefore, and urge their journalists to avoid trademarks altogether by means of a paraphrase. Thus “sticking plaster” is used instead of band-aid in the UK, and “adhesive strip” in the US. Their other strategy when the word cannot be avoided (as in verbatim quotes) is to capitalize it, to show that it’s not being used carelessly. Yet the effect can be quite unfortunate: . . . according to the minister: “It was just a Band-aid solution to the agricultural problem.” The use of the capital letter invites a literal rather than figurative interpretation of band-aid. A way out in this case would be to put quote marks round “band-aid solution.” \n The currency of trademarks varies from place to place. Aspirin, for example, is still protected in Canada, but no longer in Britain, the US, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The status of trademarks can be ascertained in: \n ∗ the UK, through the website at www.patent.gov.uk/tm/ \n ∗ the US, through the Trademark Checklist (USTA 1990), updated by the International Trademark Association (formerly the US Trademark Association) \n ∗ Canada, through the Canadian Trade Index, published by the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association \n ∗ Australia, through the website at www.ipaustralia.gov.au \n ∗ New Zealand, through the website at www.nztrademark.com."

	{
		"title": "transfers",
		"explanation":"Words often acquire new roles and meanings by being transferred from one grammatical class to another. Shakespeare made it happen in much-quoted examples like spaniell’d me at heels. A C21 example would be We scubaed down to the sunken wreck. The same grammatical process can be applied to compounds, as in: \n They were short-changed at the restaurant. \n He button-holed me in the corridor. \n The conversion of nouns and noun compounds to verbs has fostered innumerable new usages since the Middle English period, when the number of inflections used for different classes of words was reduced to the few we use for verbs and nouns today. Many of the transfers produced by Shakespeare are now unremarkable elements of the English language. Even recent examples are quickly assimilated, such as the following verbs, all from the first half of C20: \n audition contact date debate feature \n package page pressure process service \n The reverse process, by which verbs are converted into nouns, is also common enough. The following are all very old transfers of this kind: \n aim contest fall hunt laugh \n lift look move push reject \n ride scan shudder sneeze split \n Adjectives also lend themselves to grammatical conversion, and have generated new verbs all through the history of English. Examples from C13, C14 and C15 include: \n black blind brown calm crisp dim \n dirty empty equal humble secure treble \n Even comparative adjectives can become verbs, witness better and lower. \n All those examples show that English permits and even encourages such transfers. Some transfers are nevertheless resisted when new, especially nouns pressed into service as verbs, such as action, impact, interface, profile. The usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary (2000) still votes solidly (74%) against the use of author as a synonym for “write,” and only 53% of its members accept the use of host as a verb, when it means welcoming guests at a show or public reception. The panel rejects the use of buy and quote as nouns (61% and 85% respectively). Transfers launched in one variety of English may take a while to reach others, and find resistance when they do. Dictionaries, including dictionaries of neologisms, vary in their readiness to list them (Ayto, 1998), and their absence may or may not correlate with local usage. Merriam-Webster (2000) lists verbs such as voucher (“provide a voucher for”) which are not countenanced in New Oxford (1998). By the same token New Oxford records the use of trial as a verb, but Merriam-Webster does not. \n Other linguistic terms for transfers or the conversion of words from one grammatical class are functional shift, and zero derivation, because the word changes class without any derivational suffix.

	},
	{
		"title": "transitive and intransitive",
		"explanation":"In traditional grammar these words provide a two-way classification of verbs. A transitive verb is one with a direct object as the focus of the action it expresses, as with pick (a team) or send (a letter). Intransitive verbs are ones without an object, such as appear and vanish. But many verbs can be used either transitively or intransitively, witness: \n transitive:  They flew me to Singapore. She boiled the kettle. \n intransitive: The kettle boiled. The birds flew away. \n Note that verbs in the passive are automatically regarded as transitive, because they involve using the object of a verb as the subject. Compare: I was flown to Singapore with the first example above. Reflexive verbs are also regarded as transitive, because of the reflexive pronouns which function as their objects: She drove herself to the airport. \n The transitivity of verbs is not set in concrete, and intransitive verbs can acquire new transitive uses (and vice versa) through particular idioms. Transitive use of progress, as in progress the changes is relatively new, as is the intransitive use of enjoy, in the friendly imperative Enjoy! when you say you’re off to a show. Increasing use of intransitives has been noted in both American and British English, in examples like the word derives from Spanish, or the word is spreading. While intransitive use of derive is commoner in American sources, and spread in British (McMillion, 1998), the overall rate of innovation is much the same. (See further under ergative.) \n The fluid boundary between transitive and intransitive can also be seen in the way certain verbs are differently construed in American and British English. In the US cater can be used transitively, whereas in the UK it’s always followed by a preposition (see cater for or to), making it intransitive, according to the traditional terminology. This, and other issues of transitivity are discussed below. \n 1 Complex transitivity. In all the transitive examples so far, the verb has had one object (V+O) and is therefore monotransitive. There are also ditransitive verbs, which have both indirect and direct objects in that order (V+O+O), as in They wrote me a letter. Different again are the complex transitives themselves, which have both a direct object and another kind of obligatory complement or adverbial (V+O+C, V+O+A). (See further under predicate section 3.) \n 2 Transitivity extended. Certain kinds of verbs are transitive by virtue of the noun (or content) clause which is their normal object. Typically they are verbs which express a mental or verbal process, such as say, think: \n I know (that) he’ll do well. \n The concept of transitivity is also extended by some grammarians to verbs which take an infinitive, treating the infinitive as a noun and as the object of the verb. (See further under verbal nouns.) This makes want a transitive verb in constructions such as: They want to swim after work. The alternative analysis is to regard want to as a catenative verb, and swim as its complement – by which want is then intransitive. See further at complementation. \n 3 Phrasal and prepositional verbs present another kind of challenge to the concept of transitivity. Compare: \n He lives down the road. \n He can’t live down his past. \n In the first example, down creates a prepositional phrase, making lives intransitive (V + A). But in the second, down is closely associated with lives as a phrasal verb, and together they form a transitive construction (V + O), according to the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) and the Longman Grammar (1999). These grammars extend the concept to prepositional verbs such as rely on, as in I’m relying on you, and call its object (you) a “prepositional object.” Both the name and the concept may be debated, but there’s no doubt that there are many such verbs in English, using particles such as for (ask/call/pay/wait/wish for), in (believe/give/hand/take in) and up (bring/fix/put/turn up), on which to base such analysis. Allowing that prepositional and phrasal verbs are transitive also helps with the complexities of phrasal–prepositional verbs such as come up with, so that come up can be analyzed as the verbal unit, and with as the head of a prepositional phrase. (See further under phrasal and prepositional verbs.) \n 4 Copular verbs also challenge the transitive/intransitive distinction, as in I feel uneasy. They are usually felt to have more in common with intransitive verbs, because the item after the verb is not its object but a complement for the subject. (See further under copular verbs.) \n Despite these grammatical advances, the traditional notion of transitivity, as a two-way division of verbs into transitive and intransitive, persists in some dictionaries. Others embrace copular verbs, and auxiliaries/modals, to classify verbs better in terms of how they work in English syntax. A theoretical reanalysis of transitivity is presented in the Introduction to Functional Grammar (1985)."

		"title": "transpire",
		"explanation":"This word has been shifting its ground for the last three centuries, against stout resistance from Dr. Johnson and other commentators. Its first role in English was to refer to the biological process of transpiration, as it still does. But during C18 it began to be used of news filtering through, and during C19 to refer to events themselves, as in much has transpired in Poland. These shifts are unsurprising, given that a written comment on what transpired might refer to something happening and/or to reports about it. The ambiguity can be seen in current examples of transpire in BNC data: \n It transpired that somehow the clips had twisted and become detached . . . \n This very frequent construction with it as “dummy subject” draws its meaning from the subordinate content clause; thus the grammar itself distances us from the facts. With other subjects than it, transpire clearly means “happen,” as in: \n There are conflicting accounts of what actually transpired . . . \n Nothing so romantic ever transpired there. \n This use of transpire to mean “happen” is now common in both British and American English – occurring in about 25% of examples, according to New Oxford (1998), and “standard” according to Webster’s English Usage (1989).

Americans actually prefer trod over trodden in compound forms such as well-trod and little trod, in data from CCAE. Untrod is their preferred form of the negative adjective, and it’s listed ahead of untrodden in Merriam-Webster (2000), though not at all in New Oxford (1998). British usage is firmly with untrodden. \n Trod is also used in the US as a verb in its own right, meaning “walk [in pursuit of something],” as in trod(ding) the boards – an idiom associated with the acting profession. (In the UK it’s tread(ing) the boards.) The American use of trod has a long history in dialect, and seems to have come via Scottish to more general currency in C20. In CCAE data it turns up in various transitive collocations, such as trodding the road/path/sidewalks, and can be used intransitively, as in: apt to trod over party lines. Canadian English Usage (1997) reports recent examples from the western provinces. \n The form treaded is occasionally found for trod as the past form, in idiomatic uses, especially in American English. It occurs when it’s a matter of “treading water”: \n Most of us would have treaded water or sunk. \n The new party treaded gently. \n Treaded is also found in both British and American English in reference to the tread of tyres or shoes – for example: deep-treaded sneakers and changing from slick to treaded tires."

Both words can work as adjectives, nouns or verbs, though database evidence shows up some differences in their use. Americans strongly prefer triple for all uses, in data from CCAE; whereas British and Australian writers make substantial use of both. Treble is however more frequent as a verb, and triple as noun and adjective, in data from the BNC and ACE (Peters, 1995). Writers who use both words sometimes maintain a distinction made by Fowler (1926), that treble means something has become three times as large in size, e.g. Aid trebled to US$649 million; whereas triple means “consisting of three parts,” as in triple alliance or triple jump. Yet New Oxford (1998) lists the verb triple as meaning “become three times as much or many,” and the BNC provides plenty of examples like Its turnover has tripled in the past decade. \n For musicians, the two words still stand far apart. Treble refers to the highest voice part in a musical score, and to instruments whose range corresponds to it, such as the treble recorder. Triple refers to musical rhythm in which there are three beats to a bar (as in a waltz), and contrasts with duple and quadruple time signatures (as in a march)."

		"title": "trivia",
		"explanation":"This Latin loanword is the plural of trivium, a word used in medieval schooling for the lower or elementary curriculum. In modern English trivia means “petty details,” though it may be construed as either plural or singular, according to Webster’s Third (1986) and the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Both constructions can be found in BNC data. Compare: \n the endless trivia that surround most criminal prosecutions \n the apparent trivia is also serious \n Yet the fact that the BNC contains examples of these trivia but not this trivia suggests a continuing preference for the plural, and it’s glossed that way in New Oxford (1998). By contrast Merriam-Webster (2000) affirms that trivia can be singular or plural in construction. Data from CCAE provides a few examples of this trivia but not these trivia, and otherwise almost always singular constructions (trivia that matters, trivia is king!). Its most frequent use is as a modifier in trivia question/answer where the singular/plural distinction is neutralized. On the evidence then, British usage inclines more to the plural and American to the singular, but there’s also acceptance of the other construction. Trivia has not been a focus of concern like data or media (see under those headings). Canadian English Usage (1997) comments that few object to the singular construction."

		"title": "-trix",
		"explanation":"This is sometimes thought of as a feminine suffix, because it identifies the feminine gender in pairs like aviatrix/aviator, coined from Latin. Strictly speaking, the operative ending is -ix, since the t and r belong to the stem. It appears in very few other words in English, only executrix and testatrix, which are confined to law; and dominatrix (the “Madam Lash” of sado-masochism). Given their specialized character, the -trix words would seem unlikely to impact on the status of women generally – unlike those formed with -ess, a more frequently used feminine ending. (See -ess.) \n When used in the plural, words with -trix can maintain their latinity with -trices or become more English with -trixes – according to context. See -x sections 2 and 3."

See waiter, waitress or waitron."

	{
		"title": "troop or troupe, trooper or trouper",
		"explanation":"All these go back to the French troupe(au) meaning “organized group of people,” but the spellings with “oo” and “ou” are associated with different activities. The older English (C16) spelling troop (used in the singular) refers to certain kinds of military unit, in artillery, armored formation and cavalry. In the scouting movement, a troop is a group of three or more patrols. The plural troops is military usage for the whole body of soldiers, rather than units within it. The French spelling troupe was reborrowed in C19 to refer to a group of actors or entertainers, and is readily modified as in dance troupe, Paris circus troupe, troupe of traveling players. \n The distinctions between troupe and troop carry over to trouper and trooper. Trouper refers to a member of an entertainment group, and trooper (in the UK) to a soldier associated with an armored unit or cavalry, and, in the US, a member of a state police force. The first is proverbially a committed and experienced performer, the second the archetypal champion at swearing. Compare: \n He carried on like a trouper. \n He swore like a trooper. \n While trouper is often embellished with adjectives like “real” and “old,” trooper is a plain job title. However the Oxford Dictionary (1989) noted that trooper was sometimes substituted for trouper, and the BNC provides examples such as the good trooper that she is. It happens in more than 1 in 4 instances of the word, though the accompanying adjective leaves no doubt about the meaning."

		"title": "truism",
		"explanation":"This is a word to be wary of. In logic, a truism is a tautology, i.e. a self-validating statement such as A triangle has three sides. But the word is also commonly used to refer to a self-evident truth, one which requires no proof. As such it may be an axiom, or worse, a platitude so obvious that it does not bear uttering. This last possibility makes truism an unreliable word, and one to avoid if you want to stress the fundamental truth or factuality of something, as in: \n It’s a truism that violence breeds violence. \n With truism embedded in it, the statement runs the risk of either being thought pretentious, or to mean that you think the observation is superfluous. Either way you need to express the thought in other words."

		"title": "try and",
		"explanation":"Try and is a paraphrase of try to, typically used in informal promises and instructions, as in: \n I’ll try and keep in touch with her. \n Try and come soon. \n It expresses a supportive attitude, as Fowler (1926) noticed, and has a particular interpersonal role to play, hence its relatively high frequency in conversation. Even there it’s outnumbered by try to in the ratio of about 2:5, in the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus. The data show that try and is a stranger in nonfiction writing (both newspaper journalism and academic prose), altough it does occur sometimes after to, in the structure to try and, where it helps to avoid the echoic to try to. Try and is more common in British than American English, judging from fictional data in the Longman corpus. \n The conversational tones of try and have tended to raise eyebrows about its use, but it’s grammatically straightforward. The expression is curiously fixed since no other part of the verb (tries, tried, trying) can go with and. Fowler queried whether it could be used in the negative, but with 60 instances of Don’t try and ... in a variety of BNC sources, there’s no doubt about it. \n Try and isn’t the only construction of its kind in English. Analogues can be found with other common verbs such as come/go/stop, as in: \n come and see, go and ask, stop and think \n These are in fact more flexible than try and, since they can also be construed in the past: came and saw, went and asked, stopped and thought."

These types of takes both plural and singular nouns following, as in these types of drama and these types of plays.

Typhus was identified first by de Sauvages in 1759, as a severe and often fatal infection, characterized by great lassitude and the eruption of reddish spots. It was associated with crowded human habitations, such as camps, hospitals, jails and ships, hence some of the earlier names for it: camp fever, jail fever. Somewhat later its cause was found in the micro-organisms transmitted by fleas and lice in crowded places. \n Typhoid fever has similar febrile symptoms, and was not distinguished from typhus until mid-C19. Its source is a dangerous bacillus in contaminated food or drink, which causes severe intestinal inflammation and ulceration – again often fatal."

		"title": "tyre or tire",
		"explanation":"In British and Australian English, these two spellings are used to distinguish the rubber shock-absorber round the rim of a wheel (tyre) from the verb meaning “exhaust” (tire). In American and Canadian English, tire serves for both meanings. \n The words are quite separate in origin. Tire meaning “exhaust” goes back to Old English, whereas tyre is a contracted form of attire, a loanword from French. At first it could refer to any kind of wheel covering, such as the metal rim on a cart wheel, later made of wood or cork. The use of rubber was a byproduct of C19 colonialism, and the first inflatable rubber tyre was patented in 1890. All through this time, the word could be spelled either tire or tyre, and tire was endorsed by the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928), and by Fowler (1926). However the spelling tyre was the one used in the patent, and subsequently taken up in Britain as C20 progressed. It has no etymological justification, but appeals to those who prefer that homophones should not be homographs as well. In fact the grammar of the two words keeps them apart, and North Americans do without tyre, at no obvious cost to communication."

		"title": "U and non-U",
		"explanation":"No other letter of the alphabet has the touch of class that goes with U. In the late 1950s it acquired unforgettable social and linguistic significance as the letter/symbol for “upper class,” and especially for the speech habits of the British aristocracy. Class differences in speech had certainly been recognized before in Shaw’s Pygmalion (1913), which dramatized the contrast between the languages of the upper crust and the working class. U and non-U are different in that they focus on the differences between upper and middle class, seen as upwardly mobile. \n The terms U and non-U were coined by Alan Ross in an academic article published in 1954. They might never have caught on but for the reduced version of the article that appeared two years later in a small anthology of essays, Noblesse Oblige, edited by Nancy Mitford. Ross identifies differences in pronunciation, in greetings and modes of address, and especially in the choice of words, for example: \n drawing room (U) - lounge (non-U) \n jam (U) - preserve (non-U) \n lavatory (U) - toilet (non-U) \n napkin (U) serviette (non-U) \n rich (U)  - wealthy (non-U) \n scent (U) - perfume (non-U) \n vegetables (U) - greens (non-U) \n writing (U) -  paper (non-U) \n note (U) - paper (non-U) \n For the traditional U-person, the alternative terms in the non-U list point to the pretensions of the nouveau riche or the would-be riche. Many are borrowings from French, to which the English have always turned for verbal sophistication (see further under frenchification). \n The language has of course moved on since the 1950s, and some of Ross’s non-U words have eclipsed their U equivalents in terms of general currency (not that this would enhance their value for the U-person). The terms U and non-U have enlarged their scope and can now refer to social etiquette as well as language behavior. Outside Britain it’s less clear who are the defining group to whom U and non-U refer, and there are no American examples of their use in data from CCAE."

The so-called “Act of Union” brought the whole of Ireland into the “United Kingdom” in 1801, but in 1921 the south of Ireland (Eire) regained its independence, and now only Northern Ireland remains. \n The abbreviation UK is useful shorthand – not just in addresses, tables and lists where space is at a premium. In everyday writing it provides a brisk identification whether the discussion focuses on UK lagers or UK hospitals. The phrase UK government is arguably more accurate than “British government,” though the latter is preferred in official documents.

		"explanation":"Latin ultra was an adverb and preposition meaning “beyond.” In modern English it works as a prefix for various adjectives, with the meaning “beyond the range of,” as in ultrasonic and ultraviolet. Some scientific formations of this kind have become household words, in abbreviations such as UHT milk (“ultra-heat-treated”) and the UHF wave band, meaning “ultra-high frequency.” But in common words ultra- often means “extremely or very,” as in ultrafashionable and ultramodern. \n Ultra can also be used as an independent adjective, as in: \n They were voting with the ultra conservatives. \n Its use as a noun for “one who goes to extremes” can be seen in: \n Punks are the ultras of counterfashion. \n In both these uses, and some of the compound adjectives, ultra carries the value judgement “excessive.” This meaning seems to have originated in the French loan ultrarevolutionary, first recorded in 1793, and latent in many nonscientific words which have been coined with ultra- since then."

Overall, the more the word appears in everyday use, the more likely it is to take the English plural, as with aquariums, compendiums, condominiums, emporiums, forums, gymnasiums, pendulums, planetariums, ultimatums, vacuums. Those which most often appear in scholarly or institutional contexts maintain their Latin plurals, e.g. colloquia, curricula, memoranda, millennia. Words that lead a double life with both everyday and scientific uses, e.g. equilibrium, spectrum, stratum, appear with the -ums plural in writing for a general audience and the -a plural in writing for the specialist. These stylistic tendencies emerged through the Langscape survey (1989–2001), as well as regional divergences. British respondents were always more inclined than either Americans or Australians to use the -a plurals, making a majority for consortia, moratoria, referenda though elsewhere it would be consortiums, moratoriums, referendums. A few scholarly words ending in -um are found with Latin plurals everywhere in the world, namely addenda, corrigenda, desiderata, errata, ova. \n Some words ending in -um always have English -s plurals, notably plants and flowers such as: \n capsicum chrysanthemum delphinium \n geranium nasturtium \n A miscellany of everyday words also have English -s plurals: \n album asylum conundrum \n euphonium harmonium momentum \n museum nostrum premium \n quorum vademecum \n The reasons why these have English plurals only are intertwined with their individual histories. None of them have straightforward connections with Classical Latin nouns. \n Note finally that the Latin and English plurals express different meanings for some words: \n ∗ mediums – the means or material for doing something; or spiritualist links with the supernatural \n ∗ media – channels of communication, especially mass communication: particular materials or techniques of art \n ∗ stadiums – sports grounds \n ∗ stadia – stages of a disease."

German loanwords such as Fra ¨ulein and F ¨uhrer are however seen occasionally in English with their umlauts.

Un- has no semantic value in verbs such as unloosen (= “loosen”) and unravel (= “ravel”), discussed under loosen and ravel. \n In longer adjectives, especially those ending in -able, un- is tending to replace the Latin negative prefix in-.

		"title": "underhand or underhanded",
		"explanation":"Tricky things lie below the surface with both these words, as well as regional differences in their use. In British English underhand usually means “sly” or “deceptive,” as in underhand profiteering, and underhanded is very occasionally used for the same purpose. For Americans, this is the normal use of underhanded, in underhanded sales tactics and numerous other examples from CCAE. \n Meanwhile the primary American use of underhand is more literal. It refers to a throw or shot of the ball where the momentum comes from below the shoulder, as in an underhand toss in baseball, or an underhand serve in tennis. Though British sports writers occasionally use underhand this way (in BNC examples such as his underhand bowling was formidable), the usual term is underarm. To add to the complexity, underhanded is occasionally found instead as an alternative to underhand in American sports reporting, in about 1 in 14 instances in data from CCAE. The overlap with the primary sense is acknowledged and played on in a comment that softball and politicians are both underhanded. There the literal and more figurative meanings, the neutral and the negative are all vested in underhanded. \n Note also that underhanded can – in the US and Canada – refer to a team or working group that’s short of the full complement of players/workers, as in the home side was underhanded. It thus becomes a synonym for shorthanded (or short-handed in British and Canadian English)."

		"title": "underlay or underlie",
		"explanation":"Like lay and lie, these verbs tend to tangle with each other. The additional problem is that both can be used transitively, as in: \n Before putting the carpet down, we underlay it with rubber. \n ... skills and technology that underlie arms production \n In practice, underlay mostly serves as a noun meaning “something laid underneath,” and the verb when used refers to a practical process of laying something down. Underlie meanwhile refers to a foundation which is already there, not through (conscious) human intervention. \n Still there’s slight discomfort in the fact that the past tense of underlie coincides with underlay (present), as in: \n patterns of investment control that underlay the whole operation. . . \n Without any explicit time reference, we might wonder which of the two verbs was intended there. A preceding past verb (e.g. “disturbed”), or a following past time phrase (e.g. “in the 1990s”) would confirm it as the past tense of underlie – rather than a mistaken use of underlay in the present. \n While the past participle of underlay is underlaid, that of underlie is underlain: \n The pools are underlaid by another concrete floor (= underlay) \n The route is underlain by sedimentary rocks (= underlie) \n Occasionally underlaid is found where underlain might be expected, as in Much of Iowa is underlaid with limestone.

		"title": "unfurl or furl",
		"explanation":"When the historical novel has ships “furling their sails,” can you confidently imagine what is happening? By its origins (from the French compound fer[me], “firm” + lier, “tie”), the verb furl means “tie up.” But unless you are a sailor, you may still doubt the meaning of furl when hearing how luxury yachts have their sails furled and set by computer. Furled umbrellas are part of the stereotypical uniform of bureaucrats on the streets of London or Washington, yet that use of furl has also been obscure to at least some English users since C18, as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes. The writer describing how the smoke furled dreamily from its nostrils is not alone in confusing furl with unfurl. \n These days unfurl is gaining ground over furl, with a variety of uses that make its position more secure. It is regularly used for the displaying of banners and flags: \n Demonstrators unfurled a banner on the White House lawns. \n It serves to describe the emergence of new growth or life (maple trees unfurling their leaves; butterflies emerging with unfurled wings). In American English unfurl is now also being used figuratively to mean “reveal,” as in unfurled a strategy. In data from CCAE it also appears as a variant of “unfold,” as in As the story / the nineteenth century unfurled, a further non-physical use which is registered in Merriam-Webster (2000). There are small signs of this in BNC data, though it has yet to be recognized in New Oxford (1998)."

		"explanation":"This word has received an extraordinary amount of critical attention, with various rights and wrongs made to hang on its use. In its primary and historical sense, the word singles something out as the only one of its kind: \n Sydney’s Opera House is a unique building. \n In this absolute sense, the word cannot be qualified by words such as more or very. By implication, there are no degrees of uniqueness. Yet Fowler (1926) argued that some modifiers such as almost, really, truly, absolutely could be used with it, because they focus on whether the state of uniqueness is actually achieved. Fowler also allowed that quite unique was possible, provided you were using quite as an intensifier rather than as a hedge word (see further under quite). Since British English is more inclined than American to use quite as a hedge word, uses of unique that are unobjectionable in the US may be queried in the UK. \n That apart, the dispute over unique turns on the idea that it has a single, absolute meaning, which is itself an oversimplification. Dictionaries such as New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) recognize that in many of its applications, unique means “outstanding,” “remarkable,” “unusual.” Some would call it a “loose” application, but it can equally be thought of as an extension of the word’s range – something that happens to many words over the course of time. With its extended meaning, unique can legitimately be qualified by words such as more, very etc., and they in fact show that it’s not being used in an absolute sense. Without such qualifiers, it still means “the only one of its kind” – other things being equal. Those who doubt whether unique continues to express an absolute meaning can take advantage of other words such as sole."

		"title": "-us",
		"explanation":"This ending is very often found on Latin loanwords, and often means that their plurals need special attention. They come from several Latin declensions, and their Latin plurals are still used extensively in writing, though often replaced by English plurals in speech. \n 1 Many -us words are from the Latin second declension or modeled after it. Examples include: \n abacus bacillus cactus crocus \n  focus fungus gladiolus hibiscus \n  incubus narcissus nucleus phallus \n  radius stimulus streptococcus stylus \n syllabus terminus uterus \n In Latin the regular pattern was for the -us ending to become -i in the plural (stimulus > stimuli), which often happens in English too. The Latin plural is occasionally replaced by the regular English one (stimuluses), especially for the names of flowers and plants e.g. crocuses. The fact that the English plural involves a concentration of sibilants at the end of the word does not seem to prohibit their use in speech, as is sometimes thought. Among the various words tested in the Langscape survey (1998–2001), a majority of respondents preferred English plurals for focuses, papyruses, phalluses, styluses, syllabuses, terminuses. (British respondents were however much more inclined to termini, and Americans to syllabi than the others.) There was clear agreement worldwide on using the Latin plural for -us words which belong to specialized discourse, such as nuclei, radii, and generic botanical names such as cacti and fungi. \n The -es plural is the only one for -us words whose English use has no antecedent in classical Latin, such as bonus, campus, circus, virus. For genius, the choice of plural depends on the intended meaning (see genius). \n 2 A small number of -us words come from the fourth Latin declension, where the plural was spelled the same way as the singular (i.e. a zero plural). English loanwords from this group include: \n apparatus census excursus f(o)etus \n hiatus impetus nexus prospectus \n sinus status \n When plurals are needed in English, these words are usually given the regular -es, since the Latin zero plural is ambiguous. They should never be given plurals in -i, as if they were members of the second declension. \n 3 An even smaller group of -us words are from the Latin third declension. Their plurals have a characteristic inflection with -ra, and a preceding change of vowel. The commonest loanwords are corpus, genus, onus, opus which have Latin plurals in corpora, genera, onera, opera, which tend to be used by academics in the relevant field. Yet a majority of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) preferred English plurals for corpuses, genuses, onuses, especially those from outside Britain. \n 4 Some -us words are not Latin nouns at all, and so are not heirs to any Latin plural suffix. They include ignoramus, minus, omnibus, rebus, which can only be given English plurals: ignoramuses, minuses, omnibuses, rebuses. Most scholars prefer to give English plurals also to words whose source material is Greek rather than Latin, as with chiasmus, chorus, hippopotamus, octopus, platypus, thesaurus, though plurals ending in -i are around for some of them: see hippopotamus, octopus, thesaurus."

USA is often seen in writing – especially outside North America – in followup references after the full name has been given, and as the primary form in addresses, lists etc. Meanwhile US is common in both spoken and written discourse, and favored by Americans themselves. The Chicago Manual (1993) notes its use “in serious writing,” but not “the most formal.” The US is some 15 times more frequent than the USA in data from CCAE, and more than twice as common in BNC data. It occurs freely as the adjectival modifier in phrases such as US government and US president. In those and similar examples, the abbreviation US is strictly speaking more accurate than using “American” – which refers rather loosely to the whole continent, not the United States in particular (see further under America). \n No stops are needed in either USA or US in British style, because they are in upper case (see abbreviations option c).

Compare the roles of the two words in: \n Common usage now sanctions the use of different than. \n As that example shows, use needs postmodification, to specify what is being used, whereas usage has enough intrinsic meaning to stand on its own. \n Though usage has always referred to actual use (of language or anything else), it acquired the additional meaning of “approved use,” through appeals to Fowler’s Modern English Usage (1926). So usage guides are expected to embody “correct” usage, and to prescribe how language should be, rather than describe how it actually is. See further under descriptive or prescriptive."

		"explanation":"This quasi-auxiliary verb is a curious remnant of an older idiom. It refers to a custom or habit, as in: \n We used to sleep in every morning. \n Used to is fixed in the past tense, and as with other fringe auxiliaries there’s some uncertainty as to how its negative works. Should it be: \n ∗ We used not to get up early. (This makes it an auxiliary, which takes the negative itself.) \n ∗ We didn’t use to get up early. (This makes it a lexical verb, which needs an auxiliary to precede the negative.) \n ∗ We didn’t used to get up up early. (Here it’s still a lexical verb, which relies on the auxiliary to take the negative but duplicates the tense marking.) \n The second construction (did not use to) seems rather strange since there’s no longer an infinitive “use” pronounced to rhyme with “loose.” This helps to account for the third version, despite the oddness of having the past tense marked in two places. In conversation, it’s impossible to know whether the “d” is there or not, because of the following “t.” So the choice between use to and used to is an artefact of the transcriber’s ear or writer’s eye for what should appear on the page. In BNC data didn’t used to is in fact the commonest of the three constructions, outnumbering didn’t use to by more than 3:2 – though almost all citations for both come from transcriptions of speech. Used not to is the least well represented, but scattered over various kinds of writing as well as speech. The relativities are much the same in data from CCAE, except for the dearth of examples of used not to. The data challenge the comments of both the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) and Webster’s English Usage (1989), that didn’t use to is preferred/usual in British and American English. \n When it comes to phrasing questions with used to, there are the same alternatives, treating used to as auxiliary and as a lexical verb: \n Used you to get up early? \n Did you use(d) to get up early? \n The construction: did you use(d) to is overwhelmingly preferred in British and American English, and in Australian English as well. Yet Collins’s research (1979) also showed Australians’ discomfort in using the dubious use(d) to, and an inclination to avoid it by means of paraphrase. The following are some of the alternatives for construing the question: \n Did you get up early when you were younger? \n Did you make a habit of getting up early? \n Were you used to getting up early? \n All this shows the erosion of auxiliary use of used to, now more or less confined to affirmative statements."

For dwarf and knife, -v- spellings are only a rare alternative, in data from the BNC and CCAE. But the -v- spellings provide a significant variant for the compounded forms of hoof (compare cloven-hoofed and large hooved animals), and leaf (compare flat-leafed parsley with glossy-leaved orange trees). The alternatives may correlate with the fact that they may be regarded as deverbal (with -f-) or denominal (with -v-), since the latter aligns them with the inflected noun (hooves/leaves) in each case.

From this it’s used to describe anything unpredictable, as in the vagaries of the weather/friendship/life. The word is only rarely used in the singular now, by the evidence of British and American databases. \n When vagaries refers to erratic patterns of thought or speech, it may seem to involve vagueness as well, as in: \n ... upbeat vagaries at the end of the documentary \n ... subject to the vagaries of the interviewer’s memory \n That some find vague in vagaries is clear in its occasional misspelling as “vagueries,” found in both BNC and CCAE, e.g. “the vagueries of stylistic relationships.” Though strictly folk etymology (see under that heading), “vagueries” is underscored by common pronunciation in both the UK and the US, which puts stress on the first syllable.

People’s vagueness may be deliberate – not because of any desire to hide information, but because the situation is informal, where you wouldn’t put too fine a point on the facts being communicated. The most obvious vague words are fill-ins such as thingy, thingamajig, whatsit, whatchamacallem, whose key elements (thing, what) draw attention to their own lack of content. They are also rather amorphous, with shorter and longer forms used according to whim, and substitutable bits: compare thingamajig with thingamabob and whatchamacallem with whatchmacallit. The spellings vary especially in unstressed syllables (compare thingamajig/thingamyjig), and there are a few regional differences which may reflect local pronunciations. Thigamajig and thingamabop seem to be US variants (Kaye, 1990) of the two main forms of the word. Doohickey, deelebob and their variants are American rather than British, whereas vague words based on thing and what are common to both (Channell, 1994). \n Vague language can also be found in the use of hedges to soften the impact of precise numbers: We had about 40 visitors. With round numbers, the hedge may reflect some unknowns. But when someone says We had about 43 visitors, the chances are that it’s intended to mitigate the cold precision of the count, and to promote some give and take in the conversation. As an interpersonal strategy it has less value in writing, except to underscore the informality of the style. See further under interpersonal."

		"explanation":"Valence is the standard American spelling for the term used by chemists to describe the combining power of an element. It is also applied by sociologists to social and political forces (the political valence of popular music), and by grammarians to the power of verbs to combine with other clause constituents (see further under cases). In British English, valence and valency are both used for these applications, by the evidence of the BNC, though valency has a slight edge over valence. This kind of spelling alternation occurs in various nontechnical words (see further under -nce/-ncy). Both spellings modernize the Late Latin valentia (“power,” “competence”). \n Worlds apart in terms of seriousness is valance, a quite independent word now mostly known in the contexts of motoring and soft furnishings. In early motorcars it was the name for a cover over the wheel. Its analogue on the home front is that hanging piece of drapery which covers the upper part of a window, or the lower part of a piece of furniture. It seems to derive from an Old French verb avaler (“descend”)."

		"title": "valiant, valorous, valorise or valorize",
		"explanation":"The Latin valor (“bravery,” “courage”) underpins both valiant and valorous, but the adjectives differ stylistically. Valorous is the formal word, used especially in official recognitions of bravery, as in military and police awards for valorous conduct. Valiant is the everyday word used in appreciating all kinds of valor, from moral and political courage to the heroics of ordinary life: \n He was a valiant campaigner on environmental issues. \n ... valiant attempts to reduce the phone bill \n As the examples show, valiant has plenty of warmth, where valorous is rather cool in its formality. \n The verb valorize/valorise is derived from the French valorisation, which is based on valeur (“value”). It was first used in C20 English in reference to official price-fixing, but now more generally to mean “give value to,” “affirm the validity of,” as in the valorization of women’s voice. \n ♦ For the choice between valorize and valorise, and valorization/valorisation, see -ize/-ise."

		"title": "valuable and invaluable",
		"explanation":"Both valuable and invaluable put a positive spin on something, though they look like opposites. Put another way, that which is invaluable is in fact very valuable: compare a valuable contribution to science with an invaluable contribution to science. The negative prefix on invaluable says that the value cannot be calculated (because it’s so great) – not that it has no value. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) record shows that invaluable was formerly used to mean “worthless” as well, but citations for it stop in C19. In C21, invaluable gives unqualified praise, where valuable is somewhat measured."

	{
		"title": "van/Van and von/Von",
		"explanation":"These are unremarkable prepositions meaning “from,” in Dutch/Flemish/Afrikaans and German respectively. In their home languages the words van/von would not bear a capital letter, yet the Dutch have long been inclined to capitalize van in surnames which stood alone (Ritter, 2002): compare Vincent van Gogh with plain Van Gogh. The German practice with von is to leave the particle out, so Baron von Trapp would become Trapp. In English the general trend is to capitalize the particle (see capital letters section 1), though it seems to happen faster with the Dutch van than the German von, by the evidence of the BNC. The style for famous persons can of course be settled by reference to a dictionary of biography, and for a correspondent by checking against previous letters or the telephone directory. \n The process of capitalization is moved along by two editorial practices: \n ∗ van/von are always capitalized at the start of a sentence, whether or not the name is conventionally written with lower case: \n onventionally written with lower case: ... postwar immigrants such as Wernher von Braun. Von Braun’s impact on the American space program ... \n ∗ van/von are usually capitalized when the surname appears directly after a title, or without the first name. Thus Dries van Heerden becomes Mr. Van Heerden, and Federica von Stade just Von Stade. Surnames with van/Van and von/Von raise further questions when it comes to indexing. In principle, their place depends on whether the particle is capitalized or not, so that von Eisenblatt would be alphabetized with the Es and Von Eisenblatt with the Vs. This makes it rather unpredictable for the index-user, however. So dictionaries and directories often enter the van/von surnames in their alphabetic places under V, and indicate there the preferred upper- or lower-case style (i.e. the usual practice for names beginning with Mac or Mc). Helpful indexes also provide a crossreference at the other point where the van/von names might be looked for."

		"title": "variant and variety",
		"explanation":"The term variant is used in linguistics to describe alternative spellings, words and constructions without leaping to judgement on their status (as being “correct”/“wrong,” “acceptable”/“unacceptable”).

		"title": "variety in writing",
		"explanation":"To keep the reader with you, variety is vital. Even a shortish piece of writing is a relatively long monologue for readers; and if the style is pedestrian and repetitious, they’re likely to switch off. Writers need therefore to consciously vary their style, by such things as: \n ∗ varying the shapes of sentences, both in length and structure (see sentences) \n ∗ extending the choice of words with suitable synonyms (see synonyms) \n ∗ varying the word forms used (see under -ation and nominal). This incidentally helps to vary both the vocabulary and the shape of sentences."

	{
		"title": "variety of",
		"explanation":"This phrase can be construed in either singular or plural. Compare: \n a variety of US businesses have pulled out \n a variety of influences has altered the art’s course \n As the examples show, the use of singular agreement suggests a collective meaning for variety, whereas the plural gives it multiplicity. In data from CCAE the plural construction was better represented than the singular, in the ratio of 8:5, showing that notional or proximity agreement governs its use, more often than not. See agreement sections 1 and 5."

		"title": "vegetarian or vegan",
		"explanation":"The vegetarian and the vegan both maintain a meatand fish-free diet. But the vegan takes vegetarian principles much further and avoids eating any animal produce, including eggs, milk, butter and cheese. Vegetarian diets have of course been obligatory at various times and seasons in earlier centuries, and in other cultures. But the idea of voluntary vegetarianism contrasting with the omnivorous eating habits of others seems to arise with the first record of vegetarian in 1839. Vegan first appears in 1944."

		"title": "veld or veldt",
		"explanation":"Modern dictionaries all make veld the primary spelling, in line with usage in South Africa itself. But veldt continues elsewhere, and is in fact more common than veld in American data from CCAE, by a factor of 3:1. In BNC data, veld outnumbers veldt in the same ratio. Common pronunciation of the word still involves a “t” at the end, according to both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000)."

	{
		"title": "vellum or velum",
		"explanation":"Despite its latinate appearance, vellum (the parchment of medieval manuscripts) comes from Old French velin, a word for veal and calfskin. Velum is genuine Latin where it meant a “veil” or “covering.” Among its anatomical uses, it refers to the soft palate used in articulating nasal vowels. \n ♦ For the plurals of these words, see under -um."

		"title": "vendor or vender",
		"explanation":"These spellings both date from the last decade of C16. Vendor originated in law and represents the role of anyone who disposes of property by sale. Vender also exists for the person or machine that “vends” things, often in the street. But there’s no sign of vender in British data from the BNC, and only a very small sprinkling in CCAE, despite its being recognized by Merriam-Webster (2000) as an alternative spelling. The legal spelling vendor has effectively become the general spelling."

		"title": "venial or venal",
		"explanation":"The spelling marks the crucial difference between that which is pardonable (venial) and that which involves bribery (venal). Compare: \n She had the disarming but venial habit of plying him with questions. \n A venal police force is the first symptom of the breakdown of law. \n Both adjectives have their own abstract nouns: veniality and venality, where once again the i in the second syllable makes a big difference in meaning. \n Note that because a venial sin is forgivable, it can be atoned by prayer and other good works. In theological terms it’s the opposite of a “mortal sin,” i.e. one which means spiritual death and condemns the soul to hell."

	{
		"title": "venturous or venturesome, adventurous or adventuresome",
		"explanation":"All these are recognized in modern dictionaries as words meaning “daring, or ready to take risks.” Venturous was put to good use in past classics of English literature, but it’s become the least used of the four in current British and American English. Adventurous is now far and away the most popular in the UK, in data from the BNC. In American English it also outnumbers the others, but American writers also make considerable use of adventuresome and venturesome, by the evidence of CCAE."
	},
	{
		"title": "veranda or verandah",
		"explanation":"The spelling veranda was preferred by the Oxford Dictionary (1989), probably because it was closer to its origins in the Portuguese and Hindi word varanda. But its citations show that verandah was popular in C19, and it’s supported by many British writers in the BNC, who prefer verandah to veranda in the ratio of about 3:2. Americans meanwhile prefer veranda, which outnumbers verandah by almost 2:1 in data from CCAE. A regional divide has thus opened up, despite the fact that both New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) give priority to veranda."
	},
	{
		"title": "verb phrase",
		"explanation":"This term means different things in different grammars. \n 1 In traditional grammar verb phrase meant the finite verb of a clause when it consisted of more than one word: \n was playing \n was being played \n will have been played \n would have been being played \n The verb phrase has a main verb (playing/played) as its head, and the first of the accompanying auxiliaries (the operator) marks the verb’s tense (see auxiliary verbs). \n 2 In modern English grammars the term verb phrase is given extended applications. It can refer to nonfinite verb phrases, as well as the finite ones illustrated in section 1, though they differ in having no operator, and usually no subject. They can be simple or complex, and consist of infinitives or participles (be/being/been, have/having/had), as illustrated in the following: \n Having your arm twisted is no fun. \n It was supposed to be played on the glass harmonica. \n (The nonfinite verb phrases are shown in roman. They can be discontinous, as in having ...twisted.) Nonfinite verb phrases may support nonfinite clauses as in the first example, or work as an extension of a finite verb phrase, as in the second. Grammarians would debate whether the second example consists of one or two verb phrases – whether to regard be played as part of a complex verb phrase operated by the catenative was supposed to or to explain the sentence as a sequence of two verb phrases, one finite and the other nonfinite. (See further under catenatives.) The syntactic and theoretical implications of nonfinite verbs/clauses are still being weighed up: see the Comprehensive Grammar (1985). \n  3 In transformational-generative grammars the term verb phrase comes close to meaning the “predicate” of a clause. A sentence is said to consist of an NP + VP, i.e. a noun phrase which is the subject, and a (finite) verb phrase which includes not only the verb but also its object and/or any adverbial elements attached: \n The assistant (NP, subject) put (VP, verb) the clock (object) on the counter (adverbial). \n This notion of the verb phrase is the most comprehensive of the three, and ties in with more abstract analyses of verb complementation and verb valency. It is however rather cumbersome when the verb’s complement consists of several adverbials, with their own internal structures. \n These divergent uses of the term verb phrase, and their connections with particular theoretical frameworks show what has to be put on the table before any discussion of verb phrases takes place. The term “verb group,” used in the Introduction to Functional Grammar (1985) for the verb phrase of sections 1 and 2 above, helps to distinguish it from the other applications."

	{
		"title": "verbal and verbalize",
		"explanation":"The more you deal with language, the more ambiguous verbal seems. It can mean: \n 1 “spoken” (as opposed to “written”) as in verbal agreement \n 2 “in words” (as opposed to images) as in verbal and visual warning signs \n 3 “using verbs” (rather than nouns) as in verbal style (see further under nominal) \n The first of these uses of verbal is the commonest of the three, judging by their relative appearance in the BNC. \n Verbal is also used as a verb in British and Australian English. It refers to a police procedure whereby the remarks of a defendant noted in a police interview are presented in court as evidence against him. The inflected forms of the verb often appear with double l (verballed, verballing), though there’s strictly no need. (See under -l/-ll-.) \n Compare verbalize/verbalise, the verb used in English worldwide for the process of putting words to ideas, whether in speech or on paper – involving verbs, nouns and all classes of words. The choice between -ize and -ise spellings is discussed under that heading."

	{
		"title": "verbal nouns",
		"explanation":"Various kinds of noun embody the action or process of a verb. The most familiar are those with the -ing suffix, as in skiing (see further under -ing). Yet abstract suffixes such as -al, -ation, -ence, -ment also create verbal nouns, as in disposal, alienation, preference, abridgement. Some verbal nouns have no derivational suffix at all, e.g. rise as in sunrise (see further under transfers). \n In traditional grammar, infinitives were regarded as verbal nouns, because they seemed to function in the same way as -ing forms: compare liked to go / liked going. Alternatively the infinitive may be analyzed as part of the verb phrase or clause complement (see verb phrase section 2). \n Verbal nouns, especially those formed with abstract suffixes, tend to create a nominal style, which is heavy-going in many communicative contexts. See further under nominal."

		"title": "verbiage and verbosity",
		"explanation":"Both mean an excess of words, but while verbiage applies to the text itself and the expression used in it, verbosity can also be applied to the writer or speaker.

	},
	{
		"title": "verbs",
		"explanation":"The verb is the prime mover of the clause, and the item that makes something happen. Verbs may be classified in three ways, in terms of their meaning, their grammatical roles and their grammatical form. \n Many verbs are dynamic and express events. They may be physical events such as push, pull, rise, fall, which can be observed by anyone; or the verbal (speech) events referred to in verbs of communicating such as call, exclaim, speak, shout. Other verbs express internal, mental events, such as decide, hope, remember, think. Another group, sometimes called “stative” verbs, expresses states of being, for example, involve, mean, seem. With these semantic differences go different grammatical constructions. Eventoriented verbs may be transitive or intransitive, whereas stative verbs are typically copular (see under transitive and copular verbs). \n The verbs discussed so far are ones which would be the main verb within a verb phrase (in the strictest sense of the term: see verb phrase section 1). Other names for the main verb are lexical verb or full verb. The main verb may be prefaced by auxiliary or modal verbs such as be, have, do or can, must, should, as in am calling / can call (see further under auxiliary verbs and modality). When coupled with auxiliaries/modals they are nonfinite rather than finite (see finite verbs). They may be active or passive, according to whether their subject carries out the activity of the verb phrase or not (see further under voice). Some verbs have strong links with a following particle (see further under phrasal verbs). \n Most verbs vary in form according to tense and/or aspect, adding particular inflections (called, calling), or changing their appearance in other ways (felt/feeling, stood/standing). Verbs which mark their past tense and past participle with -ed are historically regular verbs, though the distinction between regular and irregular is not straightforward in modern English. See under irregular verbs and principal parts."

		"title": "vermin",
		"explanation":"This derogatory word is mostly used collectively, of a set of animals – or occasionally of people: \n The vermin were inside the pillow \n There are racist vermin out there ... \n Vermin can also be applied to an individual (animal or person), as in: \n He is regarded here as vermin with a malicious streak. \n Singular applications of vermin to a human being are recognized among Merriam-Webster (2000) definitions of the word, whereas New Oxford (1998) defines it by reference to the plural only. There are few examples in either CCAE or the BNC, though their sheer offensiveness tends to keep them out of print."

		"title": "vernacular",
		"explanation":"In older views of language, the vernacular was one’s native language, as opposed to Latin, once the lingua franca of Europe. This meaning survives in liturgical contexts, e.g. celebration of the Mass in the vernacular. With the recognition of modern languages such as French, Italian, English etc. after the Renaissance, the term vernacular was reapplied to the “low” forms of those languages, as spoken by the working class, and others in informal situations. The phrase in the vernacular often means “slang,” as when computerspeak is said to innovate in the vernacular with terms such as “hack attack” for a storm of computer hackers. In the US it’s freely applied to any distinctive idiom: showbiz vernacular, the confrontational vernacular of the 70s, the vernacular of a college jock. Vernacular is built into the abbreviations AAVE and BEV for Afro-American English: see Black English."

		"explanation":"This Latin word, meaning “against,” is at home in everyday English, witness its use in sporting contests: Tonight’s cricket: England versus Australia. In law it’s conventionally used to refer to the opposing parties in a law suit: Kramer versus Kramer. \n In the titles of law suits, versus is regularly abbreviated to v. British style has it in roman, according to Copy-editing (1992), whereas the Chicago Manual (2003) prefers italics – in keeping with the names on either side. In both British and American style, v. normally appears with a stop. \n Beyond the contexts of law, both v. and vs. (with stops) are used as abbreviations for versus. In sports reporting and elsewhere, the abbreviations are left in roman, like others from Latin which have become commonplace."

		"title": "vertex or vortex",
		"explanation":"The first word vertex means “apex.” It mostly appears in mathematical and scientific writing, in reference to the apex of a cone or triangle, or to the crown of the head (in anatomy and zoology). Vortex means a “whirlpool [of water, air or fire] around an axis.” It can also be used figuratively, of whirling forces which threaten to engulf people. \n Vertex and vortex have Latin plurals vertices/vortices as well as English ones vertexes/vortexes, for use in specialized and everyday contexts respectively. New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000) recognize both types, in that order. See further under -x section 2."

		"title": "very or most",
		"explanation":"In some contexts these seem interchangeable as intensifiers: \n That’s most/very kind of you. \n They were very/most determined about it. \n Grammarians find a small difference between them in that very works as a “booster” of the adjective on a notional scale, whereas most is a “maximizer” (see under intensifiers). Most forms a kind of absolute superlative (see absolute section 1). As an intensifier, most can only be used with qualities that are subjectively assessed, like those in the examples above – not ones like “brief,” “sudden” etc. There are no such restrictions for very, which is in fact the commonest intensifier in both formal and informal kinds of discourse, according to the Longman Grammar (1999)."

		"title": "via",
		"explanation":"This Latin loanword means “by way of.” Its essential use is to spotlight the route by which you go from A to B, as in flying to London via Kuala Lumpur. The C20 saw its use extended to refer to the channel by which something is transferred, as in: \n The signal is broadcast via satellite. \n You can get that information via dozens of reports. \n The policy is mediated via senior management. \n Some would allow the first two applications of via, but not the third, so as to restrict it to an impersonal channel. This is implicit in the examples of New Oxford (1998). Other dictionaries including the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and Merriam-Webster (2000) embrace all three uses of via with the definition “by means of,” and a wider range of examples. The traditional prepositions through or by could of course be used in the third example."

Both vice and vise were used this way in medieval times, and vise continues to be used in the US and Canada to distinguish the mechanical device from the bad habit (vice). Vise occurs also in derivatives (a vise-like grip) and as a verb vise(d). \n ♦ For the use of vice as a prefix, see next entry."
	},
	{
		"title": "vice, vice- and vice versa",
		"explanation":"In Latin vice had two syllables, and meant “in place of.” This particular usage survives only in rather academic discourse, as in: \n The bursar attended the meeting vice the financial manager. \n Much more often, vice- is used as a single-syllabled prefix, as in vice-captain, vice-chancellor, vice-president to indicate that the incumbent deputizes regularly for the more senior person (captain, president etc.). In the same way the viceroy exercised royal authority over a colony, and viceregal affairs are those associated with the governors of the Crown. \n Vice versa embodies the same word, literally “with the place turned around” or more approximately “with things the other way round.” It can be used when people’s roles or the order of items are being reversed. Compare: \n You should support his request and vice versa. \n We’ll visit the gallery and then have lunch, or vice versa. \n The expression has been thoroughly assimilated into English since C17, and is sometimes abbreviated to v.v. \n ♦ For other uses of vice, see previous entry."

		"explanation":"These instructions are all based on the Latin verb videre (“see”). Vide is the imperative, sometimes found on its own but more often in the crossreferencing instruction quod vide. It is usually abbreviated to q.v. (see under that heading). Videlicet is a telescoping of videre licet, literally “it is permitted to see.” It introduces a more precise explanation of something already stated in general terms. (Compare scilicet, used to introduce examples.) \n Videlicet is rarely seen in full nowadays, and is much better known in the abbreviated form viz. The z is the printer’s equivalent of the scribal mark 3, which was the standard abbreviation for -et. Thus viz. is strictly speaking a contraction (see further under that heading)."

In the US, it’s also applied to the legal access of a noncustodial parent to his/her children (visitation rights), as well as viewing the deceased prior to a funeral. The numbers of visitors to a tourist attraction such as a national park can be described in terms of visitation rates. Visitation also serves for supernatural appearances such as those of ghosts, aliens or angels; as well as devastating natural events, e.g. visitations of the plague, though such phrases sound rather archaic now. The biblical visitation of the Virgin Mary to her cousin Elizabeth (Luke 1: 39–56) is commemorated in the names of churches and convents. \n The ordinary noun visit is followed by to if what follows is a place, as in a visit to Alaska. This applies in both American and British English, but when it comes to people, usage diverges somewhat. In the US it’s usually visit with, as in his visit with the doctor, or a weekend visit with relatives. In examples like those the British normally use visit to, by the evidence of the BNC, though there are a few cases of visit with, as in the question: Visit with old Fanshawe go alright? The social aspect of visiting goes further in American and Canadian English, so that a visit with can also be used to mean “a chat with [someone],” face to face or on the telephone. However cybervisits are expressed in terms of a visit to our website (rather than with our website), suggesting the metaphor of travel rather than social encounter. \n Visit with is commonly used for the verb construction in North American English when people are mentioned, as in a request from London that you go visit with them. In British and Australian English this would be just visit them, using visit as a transitive verb. Visit is used transitively everywhere when it comes to visiting places real or virtual: visit our website at www ..."

The vogue words of earlier C20 included modern and progressive, which were replaced at the end of the century by ones like alternative and sustainable. As those examples show, vogue words embody contemporary values, and reflect changes in them. \n Some vogue words are drawn from the technology of the times. Expressions like the global village and the intelligent building embrace the revolution in communications, with that element of hyperbole that often goes with the use of vogue words and expressions. \n Many vogue words are less obviously connected with cultural developments – simply expressions which have somehow become very popular, such as: crisis dialogue facelift front \n runner grass roots marathon \n Such words are grist for reports on almost anything in the mass media, and quickly become clich´es. Today’s vogue words are likely to be old hat within the decade, just because they’re worked so hard. Those used as intensifiers, such as cosmic, fantastic, mega, unreal wear out even faster. \n Apart from the vogue words in general usage, there are those which seem to be the hallmarks of academic, bureaucratic or corporate discourse. They include words like: \n factor framework image interface \n parameter profile situation syndrome \n target \n Whatever their stylistic weight, the effect is undermined by overuse, and their being often redundant, as in the classroom situation."

		"title": "vowels",
		"explanation":"A vowel is at the heart of any syllable we pronounce. Consonants are the sounds that accompany the vowel, coming before and/or after it. In English there are about twenty different vowels (including diphthongs) by the standard analysis based on the International Phonetic Alphabet. \n The Roman alphabet has only five vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u) which naturally means that they correspond to more than one sound in English. Even vowel digraphs generally represent more than one vowel, witness the different sounds for ea in beat, great, hear, heart, or for oo in flood, good, goose, poor. One consequence is that readers make more use of consonants than vowels in identifying written words. If every vowel in a sentence is blanked out we still have a fair chance of reconstructing the words from the consonants and the inherent grammar. So while vowels are indispensable to spoken language, the consonants are more fundamental to the written word, at least in English. Classified advertisements, and text-messages (TXT) compress words by omitting vowels rather than consonants: see further under SMS."

Vulgar expressions were therefore colloquialisms, to be avoided if you were aiming at literary style.

Much more often it finds its object through phrasal verb constructions, especially with for. See next entry."

		"title": "wait for, wait on and wait up",
		"explanation":"In English everywhere, the expression wait for is standard for being in expectation of something or someone: \n They waited for the President’s cavalcade. \n Wait on also has some widely accepted uses, such as the rather formal sense of “serve” (as in waited on the Queen) and the religious idiom wait on the Lord (God). Its use in waiting on tables is also standard everywhere. But the use of wait on as an alternative to wait for has been questioned, especially since it was declared “obsolete” by the Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928). In fact it is alive and well in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with both personal and impersonal objects: wait on the President / the results of the elections. Dictionaries in North America and the antipodes register it as standard usage, and Merriam-Webster (2000) makes a point of saying that it is current and not confined to the American South. New Oxford (1998) meanwhile notes only intransitive use of wait on in the sense of “be patient” (Wait on, Marie), and describes it as “informal,” and associated with “Northern English.” But in BNC data there are ample examples of wait on being used in the same way, at least before impersonal objects, in various kinds of prose: \n  . . . did not wait on a Home Office ruling \n Aries will wait on market response before planning any [expansion] \n Manchester United wait on BR’s decision on his fitness \n Important matters had to wait on his attention. \n Perhaps wait on is enjoying a revival in British English. At any rate it’s being used without inhibition by UK writers, and seems to be standard (if minority) usage there, as elsewhere. \n Wait up means “stay up late for someone to return home” wherever you are. But in North America, especially Canada, wait up can also mean “slow down so that others can catch up.” There are some small examples of it in CCAE, although it’s not mentioned in Merriam-Webster (2000)."

		"title": "waiter, waitress or waitron",
		"explanation":"The push towards nonsexist language means that waiter is preferred by many, whether the person providing table service is male or female. When calling the waiter, it’s unnecessary to draw attention to the sex of the person concerned, except when their dress (or lack of it) makes it something you cannot overlook. The trend is reflected in gender-free definitions in most dictionaries (a person / one who provides table service) in North America, Australia and New Zealand. Editing Canadian English (2002) comments that waiter has become “understood as gender-neutral,” and it recommends against using unnecessary female forms derived with -ess (see further under that heading). The Oxford Guide to Style (2002) likewise speaks of referring to occupations in “asexual” terms. In Australia and New Zealand, government style manuals have made recommendations along these lines since 1988 and 1997 respectively. \n Waitron was concocted in the US in the 1980s, though it has never caught on, by the dearth of evidence in CCAE. The ending was supposed to represent “one” (i.e. “person”), but it probably smacked of the robotic automaton, the last thing you want in restaurant service. With waiter redefined to cover both sexes, waitron has already passed its use-by date. See further under -tron."

		"explanation":"Anglo-French law gave us waive and waiver, as ways of referring to official concessions. Even in nonlegal use they keep their official overtones: \n The committee must agree to waive the prerequisite. \n A visa waiver can be obtained at the border. \n Wave meaning “signal with the hand” comes from Old English, with roles as noun and verb that are quite distinct from waive, most of the time. They only come close in idioms such as wave aside meaning “dismiss.” For example: \n He waved aside my offer of payment. \n Wave aside still differs from waive in being a personal dispensation rather than an institutional one. \n Note also the verb waver (“hesitate”), borrowed from Old Norse. Its only chance of being confused with waiver is on the rare occasions when it’s used as a noun: \n There wasn’t a waver in the line of protesters. \n The two words still contrast, in that waver suggests indecision whereas waiver always connotes some form of decision-making."

		"title": "wake, waken, awake or awaken",
		"explanation":"These verbs present a confusion of choice to refer to emerging from sleep or rousing someone from it. In practice wake is the most popular by far in both American and British English (often in the phrasal form wake up). In both the US and the UK, its past forms are woke/woken, with scant evidence of waked in data from the BNC or CCAE. Waken (wakened) is the least popular of the four verbs in both databases, though surviving better in British English, in a wider variety of discourse than in American English. \n Awake now most often appears as an adjective or adverb, in combinations such as be/keep/lie/stay awake. Curiously, the verb awake in the present tense is rare in both BNC and CCAE, yet quite well represented by the irregular past awoke, providing an alternative to woke up. The irregular past participle awoken complements it in British English, but is rare in American, in comparative evidence from the databases. Neither the Americans nor the British seem to use the regular past form awaked, for either past tense or past participle. \n Awaken provides another alternative to the verb wake, though database evidence shows that it’s more popular in American than British English. In particular, the relatively high frequency of awakened as past participle in CCAE suggests that it may also do service for awoken. Awaken is used in both varieties to refer to waking from sleep, but it’s also the most likely of the four to be used figuratively, as in: \n . . . to awaken memories of summers past \n . . . awaken the stock market to its present peril \n Not to mention awakening the proverbial sleeping giant. \n English seems always to have had multiple expressions for “wake.” There were two simple verbs in Old English, one strong, one weak, which gave us woke and waked. Another was waken, with n added into the present stem to make it inchoative, i.e. carry the sense of just beginning to wake (see under inchoate). Waken was reinforced by its Old Norse counterpart vakna, and preserved in more northerly medieval writing. Awake and awaken once provided intransitive alternatives to the others, but can now be used either transitively or intransitively – as can they all. No-one has felt the need to standardize their roles."

		"explanation":"In British English these two keep their distance: wrangle means “quarrel” (they always wrangled over details), and wangle “extract [something] with difficulty”: \n He had wangled a meeting with Mr Bush. \n Americans use wrangle to refer to quarreling, as well as to achieving something not to be taken for granted, as in: \n . . . wrangled a refund from the company \n She wrangled herself a job with the basketball team. \n The councilman had wrangled the use of an empty building to house his collection. \n These and other examples from CCAE should not be seen as mistakes where “wangled” was intended. In fact this use of wrangle probably owes something to the American frontier where the horse wrangler (in Spanish caballerango) was the legendary master of things. In movie credits the animal wrangler is noted, though the movie casting is not yet attributed to the “people wrangler.” The verb wrangle has nevertheless gone ahead, and, in all the examples listed above, it involves manipulating people. Merriam-Webster (2000) registers this meaning by crossreference to wangle, but its background makes it independent of both wangle and wrangle (“quarrel.”) The origins of wrangle are usually found in Low German wrangeln (“struggle”) – which also accounts for the Cambridge University wrangler, i.e. a first-class graduate of the mathematics tripos. \n ♦ Compare cum laude."

		"title": "-ward or -wards",
		"explanation":"These endings on adjectives and adverbs imply movement in a particular direction: downward(s), upward(s) etc. In British English the choice between them is governed by grammatical principles, which are largely neutralized in American. \n The general practice in the UK is to use -ward for the adjective, and -wards for the adverb, as in downward pressure/spiral/trend and climb/move/slope downwards. The -wards form makes productive use of the adverbial -s ending, which is otherwise only residual in English (see further under -s). But in American English, -ward serves for both adverb and adjective most of the time. Compare: \n an immediate downward spiral . . . \n  spiraling downward into criminal activity \n American writers occasionally use downwards when the word’s use is more adverb than adjective (e.g. hold it face downwards), by the evidence of CCAE. But they don’t make systematic use of the -wards form. These regional divergences apply to others in the set, including: \n eastward(s) heavenward(s) homeward(s) \n inward(s) landward(s) northward(s) \n onward(s) outward(s) seaward(s) \n sideward(s) upward(s) westward(s) \n They apply also to ad hoc words such as skyward(s). \n The regional/grammatical differences just described for British and American English work less than perfectly for the most common cases such as backward(s) and forward(s). In BNC data backward is found for the adjective in about 85% of instances (e.g. backward thinking, a backward society), the rest being clearly adverbial. And though backwards is an adverb in about 95% of instances in the BNC, as in face/go/lean backwards, there are two notable kinds of exception. One is when referring to a physical direction, which is normal for backwards, whereas backward is often figurative, meaning “not progressive,” as in the examples above. The need to avoid the negative implications of backward explains the use of backwards as adjective in contexts such as sports reporting: a backwards pass would be strategic, but a backward pass might not. Adjectival use of backwards is also common when it follows the noun, as in a step backwards. (See further under postpositive.) Backwards also makes its mark in American data from CCAE, as the less common form but clearly current. It appears in sports reporting for reasons explained above, and more generally in well-established idioms such as bend over backwards, go(ing) backwards, spelled backwards – not to mention the compound adjective of software designers: backwards-compatible. \n With forward(s), the grammatical distinction between adverb and adjective hardly seems to apply, even in British English. Forward is very commonly used as an adverb, as in bring/carry/lean/look forward, and there are thousands of examples like those in BNC data, as opposed to a few hundred of forwards. In combinations like backwards and forwards, it still tends to match the other in its adverbial form. But forward seems to be taking over generally in the UK, with forwards often a plural noun (sports reporting again!), as almost always in American data from CCAE. \n In Canadian English, the grammatical distinction between -ward and -wards is not regularly observed (Fee and McAlpine, 1997), and it seems to be waning in Australia (Peters, 1995). We may lament its passing as the last bastion of adverbial -s – or embrace the process of streamlining. \n ♦ For the choice between toward or towards, see under that heading. \n International English selection: With the increasing use worldwide of -ward for both adjective and adverb, and the loss of adverbial -s, it makes sense to prefer it, except in idioms where the -wards form is fixed."

In law warrantee is reserved for the person to whom a warranty is given. But outside the law the roles of warrantee/warrantor and the warranty are of much less interest than the pledge itself, and the context makes the focus plain whichever spelling is used. The same issues arise with guarantee/guaranty, and the spelling warrantee may well be prompted by the high frequency of guarantee (see further under that heading). In fact all these go back to the same French source, which was warantie in the northern dialect and garantie further south. \n In common usage, the functional domains of the warranty and the guarantee overlap. Some distinguish them in terms of the guarantee’s commitment to repair or replace, and warranty’s pledge that the goods have been fully tested and checked before being marketed. Caveat emptor!"

In the UK and Australia, the noun wash-up can be used to refer to the debriefing process after an event, but it’s not known in North America. In American slang washed-up is used of has-been sportsmen and performers of many kinds. It levels the washed-up boxer / hockey star with the washed-up comic / rodeo cowboy, not to mention washed-up veterans and investment advisers.

Database evidence from the BNC and CCAE shows that WASP is commoner by far in both British and American English.

Compare: \n The lecture was a waste of time. \n We hope to reduce the work force by natural wastage. \n By this distinction waste has negative connotations and wastage is neutral. \n Yet both the Oxford Dictionary (1989) and ones more recent show that the distinction just illustrated is not watertight: wastage is also applied to human wastefulness, and used as a synonym for waste. This may reflect the seductive power of the longer word, as Fowler (1926) thought, and/or the fact that wastage has acquired some of the negative coloring of waste. So if you need a neutral way of referring to the natural attrition of a resource, it’s best to spell it out as natural wastage – or else seek an alternative expression."

		"title": "way and the way",
		"explanation":"Apart from being a very common noun, way has additional roles as an adverb and conjunction, especially in conversation and in everyday writing. ∗way is an adverb in: \n AR finished way ahead. \n The speech was way off the mark. \n . . . the danger of inflating the person way out of proportion to the job. \n There way means “far” or “a long distance,” a usage which is well established, on record since 1849. New Oxford (1998) still bills it as “informal,” though expressions such as way ahead/off/out appear in a variety of written texts in the BNC. There’s some evidence too of way serving as a general intensifier, in examples such as: way too polite, and B. takes way too long to resolve the plot. The use of way as an intensifier is certainly very common in American English, and registered without stylistic restrictions in Merriam-Webster (2000). \n ∗the way serves as a conjunction in sentences such as: \n The birds don’t sing the way they used to. \n In traditional grammar, this use of the way was regarded as elliptical for in the way that, and some writers still spell it out in academic and formal contexts. Yet research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) showed that the way (in its elliptical form) was used almost as much in academic writing as in fiction and conversational data, and that it actually appeared less in news reporting than the other genres. This suggests that British sensitivity to the use of the way as a complex conjunction has diminished since Mittins et al. (1970) found strong reactions to its appearing in formal speech and writing. In the US it has long been accepted, as demonstrated by research before and after World War II, and Webster’s English Usage (1989) finds it unexceptionable."

In speech we can pass unnoticed, masked by the appositional structure (see apposition). Webster’s English Usage (1989) notes examples from print as well, always in apposition – as are some of those in the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Despite the apposition, us would be expected in formal writing, in both American and British English. \n The plural we is conventionally used by a single person in several kinds of context. “Royal we” is of course a linguistic privilege of the British monarch, though sometimes assumed by other heads of state: the “presidential or premier we” (Wales, 1996). Doctors, psychiatrists and other health carers use the “doctor we” to involve the patient in his/her own treatment (e.g. We need strategies to cope with stress). Teachers too use an inclusive we when trying to engage children in productive activities: Now we mustn’t poke the person next to us, Stevie. \n In some institutional genres of writing, we is the conventional persona for projecting an argument. Newspaper editors use it, speaking on behalf of the nation or the newspaper; as do scientists and academic writers when seeking to involve the whole academic community in their point of view. This use of we/us is unlikely to raise eyebrows, except when the opinion attributed to the pronoun is contrary to that of the reader. Therein lies the rub. But persuaders and narrators of all kinds use we to establish solidarity with their audience, and create a feeling of common identity. It thus serves a rhetorical purpose in many a context.

Meanwhile the construction of wean with onto (on to) is typically gastronomic: \n Patients were gradually weaned onto a normal, unrestricted diet. \n Lionfish can be weaned onto non-living foods."

Something that’s “virtually unheard of ” could well happen. So meaningful and virtually are weasel words, robbing those next to them of their force. \n Weasel words is however often used more loosely, to refer to a misleading statement or empty promise: \n . . . a few weasel words in a newspaper do not constitute a policy of nuclear deterrence. \n Shorter dictionaries are inclined to note the second application of weasel words without the first."

		"title": "weave",
		"explanation":"The verb weave has two kind of past tense (wove and weaved), which go with different senses of the word. When it refers to the weaving of a fabric, or of verbal texture of some kind, wove is usually the past tense (and woven the past participle): \n wove nets of hemp, densely woven fibres, \n wove fancies from fact, subplots rooted in family are deftly woven \n  Weaved is used especially for the past forms when describing the winding movement of a person or a vehicle, in phrases such as weaved from side to side and she had weaved her way across the garden. Yet wove is occasionally used by both British and American writers when describing patterns of movement: the car wove through the traffic (it occurs in about 15% of instances of the word in the BNC and CCAE). Weaved is very occasionally used in describing verbal webs, as in weaved his/her/their magic. Those are minority variations on the specialization of wove(n) and weaved, which gives complementary roles to the regular and irregular forms. See further under irregular verbs sections 7 and 9."

		"explanation":"The adverb well is used to modify parts of verbs, as in: \n The parents were well dressed. \n Their children were well behaved. \n In sentences like these, well and the word following are independent parts of the verb phrase and not to be hyphenated. But when the same combinations form compound adjectives and become part of a noun phrase, then they need hyphens, as in: \n We met well-dressed adults and well-behaved children. \n The use of hyphened well- depends thus on the grammar of the phrase or sentence – not whether it’s part of an established compound adjective, listed in a dictionary. \n Compound adjectives with well- may be made comparative and superlative in one of two ways: \n ∗ with better/best \n ∗ with more/most \n Compare: \n  They wanted a better known architect for the job. \n They wanted a more well-known architect for the job. \n and \n He was the best loved author of his generation. \n He was the most well-loved author of his generation. \n (For the absence of hyphen in compound adjectives using better and best, see hyphens section 2.) \n Some authorities such as the Oxford Guide to the English Language (1984) indicate their preference for the forms with better and best, and they are certainly neater. Yet they lose a shade of meaning which is there in well-known and well-loved – an indication of celebrity. The forms with better/best are certainly unsuitable for various adjectives compounded with well-, where only more–most seem to work. See for example: \n He took the most well-done steak on the barbecue. \n A more well-rounded person you couldn’t imagine. \n In such cases the idiomatic meaning of the compound is lost if well- is converted into better/best. The problem is deepened by the fact that better/best are related to good as well as well, which also lends ambiguity to many well- compounds."

		"explanation":"These all appear in lower case when used to refer to a geographical point, area or direction which is 90◦ left of the north/south axis for a given place. The meaning is always relative: compare west of the Appalachians with the western suburbs of London. Note that both west and western normally mean “toward(s) or in the west.” But when west or westerly are applied to winds or ocean currents, they mean “from the west.” \n Both West and Western also appear with capital letters as the first element in official geographical names, such as West Indies, West Pakistan, Western Australia, Western Samoa. West appears in lower case as the second element in Midwest (the central and northern farming lands of the US), but is upper-cased in Far West (the states west of the Rocky Mountains). The “Wild West” was never strictly a geographical term, but rather a notional frontier region where stable government and law and order had yet to be established. Tales from the Wild West are of course the stuff of westerns, always in lower case. \n For the world at large, the West has become a political designation for the capitalist countries of Europe and North America, as opposed to the communist or socialist states of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The adjective Western contrasts with Eastern in broad cultural terms, as in Western governments and Western-style democracy. But in western medicine the implied contrast is between Euro-American culture and traditions, and those of Asia. These uses of western are often capitalized, according to New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000), and Western appears in about 90% of political/cultural uses of the word, in both BNC and CCAE. \n The verb westernize/westernise (“adapt to the culture and customs of the West”) is usually written without a capital letter. A large majority of respondents to the Langscape survey (1998–2001) preferred the lower case form for westernization, and only 18% said that they always wrote it as Westernization."

Note also how this use of what differs from its use as a relative pronoun in nonstandard speech: “The man what came to the door looked upset.” The Longman Grammar (1999) notes that this is more common in the UK than the US. The standard form for both speech and writing would be who or that came to . . . \n A final issue with what is its sometimes unnecessary appearance in comparative clauses: \n She remembered the meeting in more detail than (what) I did. \n I’d like to have the same dish as (what) I had before. \n In such sentences the conjunctions than and as are quite enough to join the two clauses. \n ♦ For the use of what in topicalizing clauses such as What the world needs now . . . , see under cleft sentences and information focus."

		"title": "whet and whetted",
		"explanation":"The days of whet (“sharpen”) seem to be numbered, judging by its uses in British and American databases. In BNC data, its appearances are largely restricted to whetting the appetite.

But these variations on the theme are heavily outnumbered by examples using appetite. Examples of its literal use, as in a whetted knife, can be counted on the fingers of one hand. A further sign of its decline is the way its past form whetted is sometimes replaced by wetted (see wet). Apart from their very similar – if not identical – pronunciations, the two verbs seem to be juxtaposed in English idiom. Compare: \n The walk had whetted their appetite. \n They had already wetted their whistle. \n The phrase wet one’s whistle goes back to C14, to Chaucer and “The Reeve’s Tale.”"

Compare the use of what as an interrogative (see what). \n 2 In relative clauses, which often provides an alternative to that in reference to things: \n I bought tickets at the kiosk which/that was opposite my hotel. \n The choice between which and that may be influenced by the nature of the clause it introduces – whether it is “restrictive” or “nonrestrictive.” (See further under relative pronouns.) That apart, the choice is purely stylistic, a matter of their relative weight, and the need to vary one’s pronouns. With other uses of that (as demonstrative or conjunction) in the vicinity, which is a useful alternative. \n 3 Which as a sentence relative. Sometimes which introduces a relative clause that refers back to a whole preceding clause, not just something within it. The difference can be seen in: \n James is buying a house, which is great news. \n James is buying a house which he will be proud of. \n In the first of these sentences, which effectively summarizes the whole of the preceding statement and is a “sentential relative.” The construction used to be frowned on, but the Comprehensive Grammar (1985) treats it as a regular part of English syntax."

	{
		"title": "while or whilst",
		"explanation":"With its several meanings, while is overworked and potentially ambiguous. Its essential and oldest use is as a temporal conjunction: \n While the Titanic was sinking, the band played on. \n  This temporal use of while overlaps with a concessive sense, which is more distinct in: \n While the recovery may be sluggish, there is reason to be optimistic. \n The concessive use shades into one which is more clearly contrastive. For example: \n While the other states have been losing jobs, \n  Connecticut’s labor market is improving. \n The sense of contrast may be affected by the position of while in the sentence. When used in mid-sentence, it seems a good deal weaker: \n The adults wanted to talk while the children pressed for a video. \n Neither contrast nor time could account for the use of while in everyday examples such as: \n The barbecue is planned for Friday, while Saturday is games night. \n In such sentences while is not much more than an additive conjunction, and some would deprecate this “modern colourless use,” as the Oxford Dictionary (1989) calls it. The larger problem in writing is just which sense of while is intended, at which point it’s often best to seek alternatives. For the temporal sense, there is when; (al)though (for the concessive); whereas (for the contrastive); and even and (for additive use). If of course you want a conjunction that combines two or more of those senses, while could be handy – provided your readers can decide which! \n The choice between while and whilst is a matter of regional dialect and style. Whilst is rare in American English (outnumbered by almost 1500:1 in CCAE). In British English they come much closer: the ratio of while to whilst is 10:1 in data from the BNC. Like while, it can bear temporal, concessive and contrastive meanings. Whilst appears in British prose ranging from formal to standard, though rarely in the daily press (Peters, 1995), or in conversational data. \n ♦ Compare amid(st) and among(st)."

Wile away is not a frequent alternative in either database, and its meaninglessness leaves it without any real basis of support."

The fact that whisky outnumbers whiskey by more than 10:1 in BNC reflects their spelling preference not their drinking habits. \n The same applies in American English, where whiskey is generic, and outnumbers whisky by 6:1 in data from CCAE.

In data from CCAE there were hundreds of instances of whiz, and only handfuls of the others – slightly more of wiz used in the second sense, as in the computer wiz or a wiz at video games. Yet whiz was the dominant spelling for whizkid and the exclamation gee whiz. \n The Oxford Dictionary (1989) preferred whizz for both words, and it’s the most common form for both senses in British data from the BNC: \n The particles whizz around at a great rate  \n . . . not such a whizz at car, boiler or electrical appliance repairs \n Examples of whiz turn up only in “gee whiz,” and occasionally as the verb of quick motion: should be able to whiz through that. This use of the single consonant is in line with British convention for the base form of verbs such as fulfil, where the double consonant is reserved for the inflected forms (whizzed, whizzing): see further under -z/-zz. At that point it makes no difference whether you regard the base form as whiz or whizz. \n The choice between whiz-bang and whizz-bang goes with your preference for whiz or whizz. The first spelling is preferred by Merriam-Webster (2000) and the Canadian Oxford (1998), the second by New Oxford (1998). Note also the distinction between the American whizkid (“exceptional person”), and the British slang whizz-boy (“pickpocket”). Other divergences are the North American slang use of whiz to mean “urinate,” and British use of whizz as a byword for amphetamines."

		"title": "who and whose",
		"explanation":"Who works as a pronoun both interrogative and relative for referring to people: \n Who is calling? (interrogative) \n A caller who gave his name as Steve just hung up. (relative) \n The examples show who in its typical nominative role, i.e. as subject of the clause (see further under cases). But in conversation who can take on the role of object pronoun: see further under whom. \n In the examples above, who is singular, but it also covers the plural as in Who were the first men on the moon? It’s the more likely relative pronoun when referring to an organized group of people: committee, team, etc. – although which is also possible: \n It was the committee who agreed to those terms. \n . . . not on that committee, which operated quite democratically. \n The use of which projects the committee as a single administrative unit, whereas who makes them individual people. \n Whose is the possessive form for both who and which (for both people and things) in relative clauses: \n The soldier whose arm was raised in salute had disappeared. \n We were sideswiped by a truck whose brakes had failed. \n Yet the idea that whose can only be applied to people dies hard, and many a sentence has been made awkward by the use of of which rather than whose. Compare this version of the second sentence above: \n We were sideswiped by a truck the brakes of which had failed. \n Fowler (1926) argued strenuously for the use of relative whose in reference to inanimates, and the controversy even then was 150 years old. Note however that when whose appears in questions at the start of a sentence, it is effectively limited to people. The question Whose computer lost its mouse? could never mean “Which of the computers has lost its mouse?” Interrogative use of whose concentrates attention on the computer’s owner, and cannot relate to the computer itself."

		"title": "whom",
		"explanation":"Whom is the object form of who, and a remnant of the once much more extensive case system in English (see further under cases). Its use overall has declined, and while it survives in writing, it’s becoming rare in speech. Its decline is more marked in the US than the UK, and this adds some regional and stylistic coloring to its use. For both interrogative and relative whom there are alternative constructions, which help to account for its disuse. \n 1 Whom as an interrogative pronoun appears as the object of a verb or preposition, and so it does in Whom did she marry? But this rather formal construction was already being questioned at the end of C18, when Noah Webster argued that it should rather be: \n  Who did she marry? \n Whom was not what people actually said, he noted; and he deplored the efforts of those who rewrote passages of Shakespeare and other classical authors, to ensure that whom appeared according to grammatical rule. Then as now, who is preferred to whom when the wh- word comes up first in a question. In the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus, this preference held for all genres of writing from fiction to academic, but was of course most pronounced in conversational data, where 1000 instances of who were not matched by a single instance of whom. \n Interrogative whom is still used after a preposition in written genres, as in: \n To whom were you speaking? \n But when the preposition moves to the other end of the sentence, whom once again gives way to who: \n Who were you speaking to? \n These two constructions show the contrast between formal and standard/informal styles, with the second now commonly used in writing as well as speech. In both direct and indirect questions, whom makes for a high style: \n They asked to whom I was speaking. \n Compare: \n They asked who I was speaking to. \n The construction that delays the preposition (in this case to) is termed preposition stranding. (See prepositions section 2.) \n 2 Whom as a relative pronoun serves as direct object, but again is often replaced by that or a zero relative. Compare: \n He is the person whom I wanted to see. \n He’s the person that I wanted to see \n He’s the person I wanted to see. \n There is an obvious scale of formality here, although the use of whom probably seems more formal to Americans and Australians than to the British. In the US, whom as object pronoun is associated with academic and expository prose rather than fiction (Peters, 1992), whereas British writers use it across the generic range. The same regional differences hold for using whom after a preposition. Whom is required in some prepositional constructions, e.g. partitives such as none/both/some/all of whom, and they occur across all genres. But in other constructions, e.g. with in, whom can be paraphrased with the help of that or a zero relative. Compare: \n She needs someone in whom she can confide. \n She needs someone that she can confide in. \n She needs someone she can confide in. \n Prepositional whom is less frequent and stylistically marked for Americans and Australians, occurring much more often in expository and academic prose than the daily press or fiction (Collins and Peters, 2003). \n 3 Debatable use of whom. The propriety of using whom in parenthetic constructions has challenged grammarians, because of conspicuous examples in Shakespeare and the King James bible, e.g. Whom do ye say that I am? which becomes Who do you say that I am? in the Revised Standard version (1952). Fowler’s (1926) strong arguments against this use of whom are reproduced by Gowers (1965), but without Jespersen’s equally energetic defense of it in the third volume of his grammar (1909–49). Both note that the problem is a kind of hypercorrection on the part of those who worry about not using whom in the right place (see hypercorrection). In some examples, the wh- word seems in fact to be both object and subject, as in: \n They asked me whom I thought was best suited to the task. \n The fact that the quasi-object role comes up first would explain why whom is used. It is a dilemma, and the New Yorker once found enough examples to run a column titled “The Omnipotent Whom.” It was discontinued when the editor found that “almost nobody knew what was wrong with them.” The construction is ambivalent. \n If whom gets a little extra airing in parenthetic constructions, this doesn’t change the fact that its use overall is shrinking. In most styles, writers paraphrase it by means of one or other alternative, and so it has become stylistically marked and associated with formal style for many readers. Only the wise old owls are continuing to say: To whit, to whom!"

		"title": "Whorfian principle",
		"explanation":"One of the tantalizing questions of language is whether it influences the society and culture we live in, or whether they determine it. Are we predestined to see the world as we do because we speak English or any other language, or does our language simply reflect what happens in our culture? \n The relationship between language and culture was one of the profound questions raised by Benjamin Lee Whorf, an American linguist of the 1930s. Whorf was an engineer by profession, but he spent any leave he had investigating the unwritten languages of American Indians, and eventually became a full-time field worker. \n While working with the Hopi Indians, Whorf ascertained that they made no use of tense with their verbs, and it occurred to him that this went hand in hand with their stable, very traditional lifestyle, which recognized no landmarks of history and anticipated no change of state in the future. It seemed to Whorf that the absence of tenses in language worked against any possible perception of historical change, and that language could perhaps condition the outlook of a people. This kind of linguistic determinism is now generally referred to as the Whorfian principle. \n Yet linguistic evidence often allows either a Whorfian or counter-Whorfian interpretation. Many Australian Aboriginal languages have highly developed case systems and demonstratives to express the location and direction of objects. You could argue that these linguistic resources have supported a nomadic way of life, or that they have developed in response to the necessities of that lifestyle. Many people would prefer a compromise interpretation: that such language resources develop hand in hand with a nomadic lifestyle, and are not simply a cause or effect of it. Language has a dynamic relationship with culture. \n This dynamic reinterpretation of the Whorfian principle lends strength to attempts to rid English of sexist and racist elements. While they are there, they may sustain and foster sexist and racist attitudes in the community. By consciously replacing them with nonsexist and nonracist words, we have some hope of consolidating equal opportunity attitudes and practices."

A widow is a line or part-line that finishes off a paragraph at the top of the next page. Its counterpart is the orphan, which is the first line of a paragraph at the bottom line of the previous page. Editors and typesetters often intervene to prevent the discontinuity, adding a line or forcing an early page break as the case may be. Widows are regarded by some as a bigger problem than orphans (Ritter, 2002), and while widows are discussed in American style books, there’s no mention of orphans. Note that the orphan is also known as a club line in British editorial circles."

Willful makes its first appearance in C17, early enough to cross the Atlantic with the first American settlers, and become firmly established in their English. Current English from British and American databases confirm the difference, and so BNC data is polarized towards wilful, and CCAE data towards willful.

		"title": "-wise or -ways",
		"explanation":"In some words, -wise and -ways are alternatives, as in: \n crosswise/crossways edgewise/edgeways \n lengthwise/lengthways sidewise/sideways \n Both suffixes have ancient pedigrees, -wise meaning “in a particular manner” and -ways “in a particular direction,” though this is no longer straightforward in common examples such as always and clockwise. The original Oxford Dictionary (1884–1928) emphasized the need to distinguish -wise and -ways, and not to substitute one for the other. But often now they express regional divergence between the US and the UK: Americans use the -wise form where the British prefer -ways. For example crosswise, edgewise, lengthwise are overwhelmingly preferred in American English, by the evidence of CCAE, whereas crossways, edgeways, lengthways are the majority preference in data from the BNC. British usage is in fact more mixed than the American on most of the examples above. The one remarkable exception is sideways, which reigns supreme in British English, and is very strongly preferred (over sidewise) even in American English. That apart, there’s a clear trans-Atlantic divide, with Canadians sharing the American preference for -wise in examples like crosswise etc. Australians share the British inclination to use -ways when both are available. \n The spelling -wise is quite stable in several other uses, and there’s no variation anywhere in the world for the following: \n 1 -wise in long-established adverbs such as clockwise, likewise, otherwise \n 2 -wise in newer adverbs of manner, e.g. crabwise \n 3 -wise meaning “clever, smart” in compound adjectives such as streetwise. Ad hoc words can be formed in this way without raising eyebrows: \n She’s as computerwise as anyone in this office. \n Being adjectives, these -wise words are built into the core of the sentence either predicatively (as in the example) or attributively, as in a computerwise person. (See further under adjectives.) \n Grammar is the issue with one final group of words formed with -wise, where it’s at its most productive in current English. They are the ad hoc adverbs in which -wise means “where X is concerned,” as in: \n Computerwise it’s the only solution. \n These -wise words are disjunctive adverbs (see adverbs section 1). This makes them grammatically mobile (unlike group 3 above), and they’re often used to begin a sentence. Given that they announce a new focus of attention, it’s their natural place. They are in fact a topicalizing device (see further under topic and information focus). But being improvised and conspicuous at the start of a sentence, they’re a ready target for those who react negatively to innovations in language. New Oxford (1998) dubs this use of -wise “informal,” whereas Merriam-Webster (2000) takes it in its stride. Words formed this way are convenient shorthand for a longer phrase, and more often spoken than written, though that’s no reason to ban them from writing. The grammar of the sentence distinguishes them from any matching adjective, as shown above."

		"title": "wisteria or wistaria",
		"explanation":"The glorious climbing plant with pendant clusters of blue flowers is usually said to be named after Caspar Wistar 1761–1818, an American anatomist, scientist or doctor, depending on which dictionary you consult. The spelling wistaria renders the surname more closely, and is preferred by the Oxford Dictionary (1989). Wisteria was the spelling used by Thomas Nuttall, curator of the Harvard botanical gardens 1822–34, who gave the flower its name. Horticultural references variously use Wistaria or Wisteria for the genus name, but common usage is strongly in favor of wisteria, judging by its dominance in database evidence from the US and the UK. Wisteria is the primary spelling in New Oxford (1998) and Merriam-Webster (2000), as well as the Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). \n Apart from the spelling issue, we may wonder whether the plant was actually named after Caspar Wistar the anatomist/scientist, or whether it might not reflect appreciation of the work of another Caspar Wistar, actually the grandfather of the anatomist, who founded the American glass industry in New Jersey. The products of Wistar the elder’s foundry (known as Wistarberg glass) were beautiful green vessels decorated with swirls and threads of applied glass – rather reminiscent of the tendrils of the climbing wisteria."

		"title": "without",
		"explanation":"This was once the opposite of within, and a synonym for “outside.” So in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, a servant could say of visitors: They are, my lord, without the palace gate. This meaning of without goes back to Old English. The modern meaning “lacking” began to appear in Middle English, and has completely taken over. The old meaning can only be revived in a contrived way by combining it with within, as in a house clean within and without. \n Without is a preposition in English everywhere, used to preface a phrase or nonfinite clause as in: \n You don’t mean to climb all day without a rest stop. \n and \n You don’t mean to climb all day without stopping to rest. \n The Comprehensive Grammar (1985) thought that conjunctive use of without was increasing in informal discourse, and most examples in the BNC are from transcriptions of speech."

Wog seems to have begun as British army slang for an Arab, explained ironically as an an acronym for “western oriental gentleman.” It quickly became a derogatory word for any non-white person (see New Oxford, 1998); and Merriam-Webster (2000) defines it as meaning “dark-skinned, especially from the Middle or Far East.” But chauvinism being what it is, wog is also a pejorative term for “foreigner” in general, as noted in the Oxford Dictionary (1989), Canadian Oxford (1998) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). It becomes anglo-centric in comments such as “incomprehensible wogs,” and phrases such as wog languages, indifferently associated with immigrants and tourists. Though wog can be used affirmatively by immigrants themselves (as in the Australian drama Wogs out of work), it’s an inflammatory word on the lips of anyone else. Part of its offensiveness is that it lumps all immigrants and foreigners together, with no attention to their individual backgrounds or identity. See further under racist language."

		"explanation":"The spelling woolen observes the convention that consonants are not normally doubled after a vowel which is a digraph (see doubling of final consonant). Compare leaden, wooden etc. In American English woolen is the standard spelling and dominant in data from CCAE. But woollen is equally strongly preferred in BNC data, and it matches the British use of double l in other derived words such as traveller, though they normally have more than two syllables (see -l-/-ll-). Regional consistency slips with woolly, which is preferred in both the US and the UK. Americans do make use of wooly as well, but it’s clearly the minor variant, outnumbered in CCAE by almost 6:1. \n Wool(l)en is the older adjective of the two, dating from C11, and still used strictly to refer to things made of wool for a commercial market. Woolly was coined in C16, and has several semantic domains of its own: \n ∗ referring to garments made of wool, but not as commodities of commerce: e.g. wearing a red woolly hat. In British English, woolly also serves as an informal noun for a pullover: in a baggy woolly and corduroys. \n ∗ describing animals other than sheep with wool-like coats, from woolly monkeys to the woolly mammoth. \n ∗ passing judgement on language which is imprecise (woolly platitudes) or muddled thinking (woolly-headed ). \n Note that wild and woolly means “rough,” “unkempt” when applied to people, but “unrestrained,” “lawless” when applied to a place or an era. Compare the outlaw’s wild and woolly look with Colorado’s wild and woolly past."

		"title": "word order",
		"explanation":"In English, word order is a significant factor in grammar (syntax). The normal word order for statements has the subject preceding the verb, and the verb before its object or complement. This basic order is modified for questions and occasionally for other grammatical reasons. (See under inversion.) \n Beyond the essential grammar of word order, we can and do vary the position of elements of the sentence for reasons of style and emphasis. Knowing that the beginning of a sentence is its most conspicuous part, we may well want to move a significant phrase into that position (see further under topic). Adverbs and adverbial phrases can often be moved around; and a sentence with a lot of them reads better when they are not all clustered together at the end. Compare: \n The speaker drew attention again at the end of his speech to the number of members absent from the meeting. \n At the end of his speech, the speaker again drew attention to the number of members absent from the meeting. \n The second version is clearer and more effective."

		"title": "wordbreaks",
		"explanation":"In printed texts, especially those with narrow columns, it’s necessary from time to time to divide the last word in the line, and put some of it on the line below. Readers are notified that the word has been divided by the hyphen placed after the first part. Longer words can often be divided in more than one place, as with re + spect + ive + ly. Thus the wordbreak can be made so as to optimize the use of space at the end of the line. \n Some dictionaries indicate the points at which the headwords can be divided, yet they are far from unanimous about it. Some go by the pronunciation of the word and how the sounds combine in the syllables; others go by the word’s structure. Compare: \n tran + scend with trans + cend \n des + pite with de + spite \n American dictionaries are often said to go by the pronunciation, and British ones by the structure; yet both compromise between the two principles on particular words. Because English words are so diverse in structure and spelling, the best general practice is to ask what the reader would make of the string of letters on the upper line. Will they provide a helpful lead on to the rest of the word – or prove distracting? Clearly it’s not ideal to break mother into moth + er, nor therapist into the + rapist. \n Apart from that basic principle, the following points are worth noting: \n 1 Words of less than six letters should not be divided; less than seven letters is better. \n 2 Words of one syllable should never be divided, e.g. straight. \n 3 Other things being equal, there should be at least three letters of the word on each line. Exceptions would be words beginning with a two-letter prefix e.g. indebted, recaptured. \n 4 Letters which together form a digraph or grapheme should stay together, thus budg + et, beaut + iful and feath + er or fea + ther. \n 5 Ideally a consonant is carried over to begin the second part of the word. Thus pano + rama, except where word structure overrules this as with draw + ing, system + atic etc. \n 6 Wordbreaks between two or more consonants (so long as they don’t form a digraph/grapheme) are usually acceptable, as in democ + racy, dif + ferent and ser + vice. \n 7 Breaking a compound at the junction of its two parts is always acceptable, as in Anglo + Saxon, awe + inspiring, heavy + duty. \n 8 Proper names of any length should not be broken. \n The computer’s automatic wordbreaking system can be set to execute some of these principles, but the output still needs an editorial eye to check for infelicities."

		"title": "words",
		"explanation":"We take them for granted, yet it’s quite difficult to define what they are. Loosely speaking they are the strings of letters which are separated by space from their neighbors in the line of print. So foot, foothold and UFO all qualify, as would foot-and-mouth, in foot-and-mouth disease. \n Compounds test our definition of word, because the hyphens in foot-and-mouth seem to make it a word, even though they would be three separate words in other contexts. Compare: The disease affects both foot and mouth. In that sentence the same words make up a freely formed phrase, whereas in foot-and-mouth they form a conventional compound adjective. (See further under hyphens section 2c.) Yet many recognized compounds such as cash register do not have hyphens and are set with space between their components. Does that disqualify them as words? The answer depends on whether you want to include all compounds in the definition, or only those which are visually unified by means of hyphens or being set solid. \n Other issues affecting the definition of word come up when we ask whether armor and armour are different words, or adaption and adaptation, or orange and oranges, child and children. Linguists handle these differences with special terminology, saying that in each pair we have the same lexeme but variant spelling or morphology. The reverse problem also arises – the need to recognize that bear (“large furry animal”) and bear (“carry”) are different lexemes/words. \n In the examples of the previous paragraph we used word meanings to help decide on their status as individuals or members of the same lexeme. The grammar inherent in words is also part of their identity and, for some, their most important contribution to the sentence. Function words such as a, and, to, the, that mostly serve to string other words together to form phrases and clauses. Meanwhile the grammar of content words e.g: cloud, float, rise, crowd is more malleable (all those could be nouns or verbs). Either way they invest phrases and clauses with their distinctive semantic content. Function words can be just one or two letters, whereas the content words are mostly a minimum of three. Go, ox and ax (in American English) are among the few exceptions, apart from abbreviated words such as ad, ex, ma, pa. The fact that content words normally consist of at least three letters would explain the reluctance of some to use spellings where the word’s stem is reduced to two, as in aging (cf. ageing). \n In fact we seem to need several definitions of word for different purposes, depending on whether we’re thinking of them as printed items on the page, or in terms of their linguistic form, function and meaning."

		"title": "worthwhile, worth-while or worth while",
		"explanation":"This expression has been steadily compacted since C19. Then it was worth the while meaning “worth the time that it took.” This became worth while (the excursion was worth while), and from this predicative use has evolved the attributive: a worthwhile excursion. The unhyphenated form worthwhile is now by far the most common form in British and American English, for predicative as well as attributive use, in data from the BNC and CCAE. Worth-while was favored for the attributive use by those who wanted to distinguish it from the predicative worth while, and punctuate it like other compound adjectives (see hyphens section 2c). Yet the hyphenated form is the least common of the three in the BNC as well as CCAE. British writers have probably been resistant to worthwhile because Fowler (1926) found no place for it (only worth while and worth-while); and Gowers (1965) too kept it at arm’s length. In the same vein, Burchfield (1996) found worthwhile “regrettably common” for the predicative. He thereby affirms what the databases show, that worthwhile is now standard for all uses of the word."

The wrath of the business community is thus equal and opposite to the wrath of the unions, and the wrath of secular leaders from General Noriega to Mrs Thatcher becomes an analogue of the wrath of God. Both seem to be embodied in The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck’s powerful novel from the 1930s. \n Meanwhile the adjective wroth has disappeared. Its demise was signaled by Fowler (1926) through cases where wrath was being used instead.

		"title": "-y",
		"explanation":"Both nouns and adjectives in English have this ending: \n  Adjectives formed with -y typically have it added to a single-syllabled noun, as in cloudy, dirty, risky, woody, wordy and countless others. A minority such as crazy, edgy, icy, shady and others, delete the final -e of the noun (craze, edge etc.) before adding the -y, thus conforming with the standard rule (see -e section 1, as well as -y/-ey). Note that when the basic word itself ends in -y, the adjective ending is -ey, as with clayey and flyey. Plural nouns can also provide the base for such adjectives, as in newsy and rootsy. Many adjectives of this kind are formed ad hoc and do not appear in dictionaries. \n 2 Nouns ending in -y fall into two major groups: \n a) abstract and often rather formal words like capacity, novelty, revelry, tracery, many of them borrowed ready-made from French or Latin. (See further under -ity and -ry.) \n b) informal words which are always English formations. Some are associated with talking to children, such as doggy, nanny, piggy; but many are used freely by adults: brolly, footy, hippy, telly. Many words of this kind can also be spelled with -ie, as with footie, hippie. See further under -ie/-y."

They include nouns such as: \n bog(e)y curts(e)y doil(e)y fog(e)y \n stor(e)y troll(e)y whisk(e)y \n In some cases different meanings are attached to the different spellings (see under individual headings for each). \n Adjectives whose spelling can be either -y or -ey are typically informal words, whose recorded history is relatively short and recent. The nouns on which they are based are much more familiar in print, and some writers and editors prefer to preserve the whole noun within the spelling of the adjective. Others allow them to lose the final -e, in keeping with the general rules of English spelling (see -e section 1, and -y section 1). For example: \n bon(e)y cag(e)y chanc(e)y choos(e)y cliqu(e)y \n dic(e)y dop(e)y gam(e)y hom(e)y hors(e)y \n jok(e)y lim(e)y lin(e)y loon(e)y mop(e)y \n mous(e)y nos(e)y phon(e)y ponc(e)y pric(e)y \n rang(e)y scar(e)y shak(e)y smil(e)y smok(e)y \n spik(e)y ston(e)y win(e)y wir(e)y \n (The non-italicized words are further discussed at their individual entries.) The sample presented in the Langscape survey (1998–2001), drew mixed responses, though the majority gave regular -y spellings to the oldest (C16) examples (bony, stony, wiry) and -ey to those coined in C19 and C20 (cagey, dicey, gamey, nosey, pricey). Age and other factors correlated with the mix of responses. Young respondents (under 25) preferred -ey spellings, either because they seem to be “safe” spellings, or because of their unfamiliarity with the rule that trims the -e. In contrast, the second-language users of English were more inclined to use the rule-governed spellings that trim the -e. Among first-language users, the British are more inclined than Americans to -ey spellings (Sigley, 1999), by the increased numbers in late C20 databases, often in new coinings. Apart from their newness, it may be that their nonconforming spellings help to emphasize their informality. But both these effects wear off over time, and it does the language no favor to increase the number of irregular spellings. \n If there is any problem in recognizing the regular spellings, it could be with examples like cagy and dicy, where dropping the -e leaves only three letters to indicate the root word. Yet icy is well established with only two. In these and others like chancy, poncy, pricy, rangy, the -y takes over the role of “softening” the preceding c or g – again in accordance with English spelling rules (see -ce/-ge). Overall there’s no reason to delay spelling these words in the regular way. For phoney, it only helps to perpetuate a spurious etymology (see phony). \n International English selection: Given the general rules for -e dropping in words formed with -y, it makes good sense to endorse such spellings for all established words of this type, not the -ey variants."

		"title": "-y > -i-",
		"explanation":"When -y occurs at the end of a word after a consonant, it often changes to i before inflections beginning with -e. It happens with: \n ∗ verbs ending in -y. These change to -i- before -ed, as in apply>applied, copy>copied, fry>fried. The same change is seen before -er, in agent words such as copier. \n ∗ nouns ending in -y. These change before the plural suffix -es, as with city>cities, estuary>estuaries, spy>spies. Note however that proper nouns ending in -y do not change for the plural: three Hail Marys, four Gregorys. Compounds also resist the change, witness laybys, standbys. \n ∗ adjectives with two syllables change -y to -i- before -er/-est: gloomier/gloomiest. Note however that this is not necessarily done with one-syllabled words, as seen in common examples such as drier/dryer (see further under that heading). \n The change of a final y to i also affects many other words formed with suffixes. The following are just a token: \n alliance beautify bounciness denial \n gloomily marriage merriment pitiless \n plentiful reliable \n Only when the suffix begins with -i does the final y remain, for example in allying and copyist. \n The major exceptions to y/i change are words in which a vowel precedes the final -y before the suffix. Note the unchanged y before regular inflexions in: \n ∗ verbs, e.g. delayed, employed, surveyed \n ∗ nouns, e.g. alloys, days, donkeys, guys \n ∗ adjectives, e.g. coyer/coyest, grayer/grayest \n The change to i does however take place in three very common verbs, where the suffix is fused with the root: \n lay>laid, pay>paid, say>said \n and in two rather uncommon nouns: \n obsequy>obsequies, soliloquy>soliloquies \n But otherwise the presence of a vowel before the final -y seems to inhibit the change, in numerous formations such as: \n betray conveyance employment \n joyless playful repayable"

The abbreviated form Yank was applied in World War II to American soldiers overseas, and since then to any American. \n The origin of Yankee is debated. Most dictionaries trace it back to Jan Kees, a derisive nickname meaning “John Cheese,” which was supposedly applied by early Dutch settlers in New York to the English colonists in Connecticut. It was then interpreted as a plural by English-speakers, and the singular Yankee derived from it. (For other words derived this way, see false plurals.)

(adverb) \n In the first sentence, yet serves as a synonym for “but,” and in the second for “however,” though it seems to make the contrast more gently than either of them (see further under conjunctions sections 1 and 3). In the third sentence yet is a gentle alternative to “still.” Compare It still hasn’t come. The choice of yet rather than one of its synonyms is a matter of style and emphasis, and it provides a useful alternative for discursive writing. In the Longman Grammar (1999) corpus, yet was more than twice as common in academic prose as in conversation. \n Adverbial yet combines with to in signaling processes that have still to take place, or thresholds still to be crossed: \n The conductor has yet to confirm the terms of his Berlin contract. \n Their skills are yet to be tested in a tougher economic climate. \n The examples show that yet to may be construed with the auxiliary have or be, though constructions with have are very much more common, in British and American databases.

In the UK both yogurt and yoghurt are current, but British writers clearly prefer yoghurt, by the evidence of the BNC where it outnumbers yogurt by almost 3:1. Yoghourt is also listed in American and British dictionaries, but not popular in either place, by its absence from CCAE and the mere handful of examples in the BNC. The more French-looking yogourt is given priority over yogurt in the Canadian Oxford (1998), although Canadian English Usage (1997) notes that yogourt, yoghurt and yoghourt are all relatively rare, and that yogurt is by far the most common – as it is across the border. Australian usage is like the British, with yoghurt and yogurt both current but yoghurt ahead on database evidence (Peters, 1995). \n Yog(h)urt was in fact borrowed into English in C17, since when no fewer than eleven different spellings have been recorded. The original Oxford (1884–1928) made yogurt the headword, which is surprising given its absence from the citations, and the fact that it renders the original Turkish less closely than yoghurt. Closer inspection finds yogurt listed as a variant spelling (as well as headword), while yoghurt is not mentioned, and we might suspect that yoghurt was intended to be the headword. Be that as it may, yogurt remains the primary spelling in the second edition of the Oxford Dictionary (1989), with yoghurt as the secondary alternative. This still seems curious in light of the fact that each occurs only once in the five citations from C20, while yoghourt is in three of them.

		"title": "you and ye",
		"explanation":"Until the later C16, ye and you shared the role of the second person plural pronoun, with ye used when the word was the subject of a clause, and you when it was the object. (See further under cases.) The King James bible still observes this in: \n Ye have not chosen me; I have chosen you. \n But this case distinction was already breaking down in Shakespeare’s and Ben Jonson’s plays, and early C17 grammarians made the two words interchangeable. You was in fact taking over, and by C18 ye had been ousted from the standard language and survived only in literary and lofty use. The takeover went still further, for you also subsumed the singular roles of thou/thee (see further under thou). \n The lack of case distinction between you and ye was no great loss, since English syntax helps to show subject and object. But the merging of plural and singular second persons leaves English without a simple way of showing whether someone’s remarks are meant solely for the person addressed, or for others whom s/he represents as well. Many an invitation has been complicated by this fact. Expressions such as you both and you all help to clarify the situation, and in informal contexts you guys and you lot, as well as youse/yous (see further under you-all and yous). Still there’s no regular way of expressing the singular/plural distinction in the English second person. \n Special uses of you and ye \n 1 Apart from its regular use in second person address, you can be used indefinitely, so that it reaches beyond the second person, as in: \n After all that you’d think he would compromise. \n In such sentences, you is an informal substitute for one, a pronoun which is somewhere between second and first person (see further under one). Indefinite you invokes something that you and I might agree on, and proposes a kind of solidarity without insisting on it. As in the example, it’s normally done in passing, in the flow of conversation. \n All this explains why indefinite you hardly lends itself to the cause of Plain English paraphrase – though it’s sometimes suggested as a cure for the impersonal or authoritarian style which besets government documents. The idea is that statements such as: \n All tax returns must be filed by March 31. \n might be translated into \n You must file your tax return by March 31. But you is then very far from indefinite. \n From the printed page it speaks with the directness of the ordinary second person pronoun, especially when reinforced by your, and underscored with must, a modal verb of obligation. As a device for pressuring people into paying their taxes, it succeeds. But it fails if a friendly and tactful form of address is intended. To work indefinitely you needs to be used sparingly and out of the topical spotlight at the start of a sentence (see topic). \n 2 Pseudo-ye. The most familiar use of ye nowadays is perhaps its appearance in old-fashioned shop signs: Ye Olde Tea Shoppe. This use of Ye is not related to the second person pronoun, but uses the Y to match the Old English character “thorn” (borrowed from the runic alphabet) which represented “th.” So Ye is simply The. In Tudor handwriting and printing, y was used instead of th in the and a number of other words: that, this, they (and sometimes them, their) to save space. It ceased to be common practice by C18, but it lingers in the Ye of pub and shop signs, wherever the whiff of antiquity seems to be a commercial asset."

		"title": "you-all and you all",
		"explanation":"This complex pronoun is associated particularly with the southern and southwestern parts of the US. It provides an explicitly plural form of the second person pronoun, which English has lacked since C17 (see you and ye). Merriam-Webster (2000) and others note that you-all is occasionally used in addressing a single person, though even then it may be explained as a way of referring to the notional group represented by that person. It has suffered from stereotyping by outsiders, but you-all is part of the speech repertoire of educated Americans from the South (Garner, 1998). Database evidence from CCAE shows its use in both public and private contexts: \n I remember years ago I told you-all about TM... \n “You-all on your way out?” the waitress asked. \n You-all is normally hyphenated, so as to distinguish it from other juxtapositions of you and all. The Oxford Dictionary (1989) notes the setting you all as an alternative, but on the printed page it runs the risk of not being seen as the complex pronoun – at least with non-American readers. The standard contracted form is y’all, although Garner notes the occasional use of ya’ll. It presumably owes something to the use of ya to represent informal pronunciation of you; and perhaps also the influence of other contractions such as I’ll, we’ll, you’ll. In those ’ll represent “will,” of course, so it’s best not to make the contraction of you-all match up with them. \n ♦ Compare yous."

It was once used widely in official and commercial correspondence in which the relationship was strictly one of business. Yours sincerely was then reserved for letters to friends. Nowadays, businesses seek friendly relationships with their customers; and within corporations and bureaucracies, the tone of communication is generally collaborative rather than distant and authoritarian. Either way Yours sincerely is more in keeping with the prevailing style, whether or not the correspondents are acquainted. Yours faithfully is increasingly reserved for correspondence addressed to the unknown reader (Dear Sir/Madam) at a government institution, and in legal correspondence. \n In personal letters, closure can take whatever form seems right for the relationship between the correspondents. With Yours sincerely used increasingly in business letters, the shortened form Yours becomes the more informal closure for veteran letter writers. But many prefer alternatives such as Best wishes or just Best (in American English); Regards or Kind regards (in British English); and others such as With thanks (Thanks), Cheers, Good luck, Much love (Love), Bye. All these and more are used in personal e-mails (Li, 2000), although about 20% of messages have just the sender’s name by way of closing. \n ♦ For the opening salutation in letters and e-mail, see under Dear. \n♦ For older and newer styles in business letters, see commercialese and letter writing."

		"title": "yous or youse",
		"explanation":"These colloquial or slang forms of you are found in many varieties of English: northern British and American, Irish, Australian. They no doubt exist as responses to the lack of distinct singular and plural pronouns for the second person (Wales, 1996). The spelling yous suggests plurality, on the analogy of regular nouns – a rather weak analogy, since the word is a pronoun. Yous is nevertheless a good deal more popular than youse in data from the BNC, and was given priority by the Oxford Dictionary (1989). But New Oxford (1998) prefers youse, as does the Canadian Oxford (1997) and the Australian Macquarie Dictionary (1997). Merriam-Webster (2000) also prefers youse, but in CCAE data it hardly occurs except in youse guys, rendering rough speech. Yous meanwhile is associated with the plural forms of conventional phrases such as thank yous, I love yous, how are yous, what have yous. \n Yous(e) is not invariably used in plural reference, despite the fact that it seems to fill a gap in the English pronoun system (see further under you and ye). Singular reference is clear in BNC examples such as Yous will be left on your own, and others suggest singular address even if the person addressed is seen as representing “another or others,” as Merriam-Webster notes. \n Whatever its number value, yous(e) is unmistakably informal in style – so much so that it can be a liability. Dictionaries always enter it with restrictive labels or cautionary notes. New Oxford dubs it “dialectal,” while the Random House Dictionary (1987) associates it with “urban speech” in the northern US, notably New York, Boston and Chicago. The Canadian Oxford notes it as “unacceptable in writing or cultivated speech.” In Australia it’s heard in casual exchanges in both metropolitan and country speech, but still associated with a shortage of education.

In fact it’s an amalgam of two acronyms: young urban professional, and young upwardly mobile person. As originally coined, yuppie and yumpie identified two social types both preoccupied with acquiring status symbols, the first distinguishable by superior education, and the second by social pretensions (cf. U and non-U). By now the word yuppie has outperformed yumpie, incorporated its image as part of its own, and “professional” is part of the definition of current dictionaries, whether British, American, Canadian or Australian.

Australian usage is like the British, and Canadian like the American, according to the Macquarie Dictionary (1997) and Canadian Oxford (1998). \n American use of -yze aligns these words with the much larger set in which -ize is used (see -ize/-ise). British English puts more weight on etymological issues, and the spellings with -yse express the fact that they came via French or Latin, as well as their connections with nouns such as analysis and paralysis. The fact that many British writers use -ise spellings predisposes them towards -yse; and the same holds for Australian English. \n International English selection: Though there are arguments for both spellings, -yze aligns these few words with a much larger set, and makes it eminently teachable and learnable.

Research associated with the Longman Grammar (1999) found that zero adverbs (of all kinds) predominate in spoken discourse, whereas in academic writing, it’s the -ly adverbs. But in some cases the zero and -ly forms differ in meaning (see direct, just and low). \n The distribution of zero adverbs and -ly forms also has a regional dimension. In parallel corpora of British and American writing, Opdahl (1991) found zero adverbs more often than -ly ones (where there was a choice) in the British data. Her findings were confirmed by elicitation tests in which American and British speakers chose between low/lowly and direct/directly in a set of sentences, and the American preference for the -ly forms was very clear.

		"explanation":"When you reach this end of the alphabet you may not care how zombi(e) is spelled! Since the 1930s it has been applied to a detached mental state and/or clumsy physical behavior (acting/feeling/staring/walking like a zombie), hence zombie-like. The word was popularized through zombie movies after World War II, as well as zombie rock (music), which probably helped to make zombie the standard spelling. At any rate, it’s stamped on other extended uses, such as zombie-cold scrambled eggs. \n The alternative spelling zombi is as close as anyone can get to the original African word, now current only in the Kongo word nzambi. It referred to the python god worshipped in voodoo ceremonies, who was believed to have the power to bring a dead person back to life. The word then became associated with the corpse thus revived – and so to the person who behaves like the living dead. Anthropologists who study surviving cults of this kind, in Haiti and elsewhere, sometimes use zombi to distinguish the word from its popularized counterpart, but it’s otherwise very rare, in both American and British databases."
